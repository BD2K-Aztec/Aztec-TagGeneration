gene_expression normalizing bead_based microrna expression data a measurement error_model based approach_motivation compared with complementary_dna cdna or messenger_rna mrna microarray_data microrna mirna microarray_data are harder to normalize due to the facts that the total number of mirnas is small and that the majority of mirnas usually have low_expression in bead_based microarrays the hybridization is completed in several pools as a result the number of mirnas tested in each pool is even smaller which poses extra difficulty to intrasample normalization and ultimately affects the quality of the final profiles assembled from various pools in this article we consider a measurement_error model_based for bead_based microarray intrasample normalization results in this study results from quantitative_real qrt_pcr assays are used as gold_standards for validation the performance of the proposed measurement_error model_based is evaluated via a simulation_study and real bead_based mirna_expression data simulation_results show that the new method_performs to assemble complete profiles from subprofiles from various pools compared with two intrasample normalization_methods recommended by the manufacturer the proposed approach produces more robust final complete profiles and results in better agreement with the qrt_pcr results in identifying differentially_expressed and hence improves the reproducibility between the two microarray_platforms meaningful_results are obtained by the proposed intrasample normalization method together with quantile normalization as a subsequent complemental intersample normalization method availability datasets and r package are available atmirnas are short non coding rna_molecules that modulate gene_expression by base_pairing with the untranslated_region of their target_mrnas it has been shown that mirnas regulate about of all transcripts in mammalian_genomes each mirna can regulate the expression_level of hundreds of different mrnas as regulators of gene_expression potential_therapeutic to whom correspondence should be addressed and biomarkers mirnas were extensively_studied in the past_few as the number of annotated mirnas continues to increase several large_scale mirna_expression microarrays have been developed including quantitative_pcr and sequencing as an alternative arraying strategy to planar substrates that are widely used in microarrays bead_based microarrays beads arrays hereafter have been developed either by impregnating beads with different concentrations of fluorescent_dye or by some type of barcoding technology the beads are addressable and used to identify specific binding_events that occur on their surface bead_based arrays allow for the inclusion of many combinations of mirna capture beads into a single pool and provide greater_flexibility over time as mirnas are discovered and corresponding beads are created in addition beads arrays are expected to have increased specificity over the traditional glass based microarrays normalization is a crucial process of removing systematic_bias as a result of the experimental artifacts from the data many existing normalization_methods assume that the majority genes are not differentially_expressed in the control and treated samples such an assumption might not hold true for mirna arrays due to the facts that the total number of mirnas is small less than and the current mirna microarray_platforms possibly do not include enough mirnas that are stably_expressed as a result methods such as normalizing by mean or median might not work well for mirna microarray_data analyses in addition because of the capacity limit of the pools in beads arrays the mirnas are divided_into small_subsets and the tests are finished in various pools separately the subprofiles of the mirnas from different pools need to be normalized to assemble a complete profile such a normalization procedure is called intrasample normalization because the mirna sets in different pools are different and the numbers of mirnas in different pools are small intrasample normalization is difficult furthermore most of the existing normalization_methods are not applicable in this study we investigate a measurement error_model based_approach to improve beads array intrasample normalization
