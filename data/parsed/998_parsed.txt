cl dash rapid configuration and deployment of hadoop clusters for bioinformatics_research in the cloud one of the solutions proposed for addressing the challenge of the overwhelming abundance of genomic_sequence and other biological data is the use of the hadoop computing framework appropriate tools are needed to set up computational environments that facilitate research of novel bioinformatics methodology using hadoop here we present cl dash a complete starter kit for setting up such an environment configuring and deploying new hadoop clusters can be done in minutes use of amazon_web ensures no initial investment and minimal operation costs two sample bioinformatics applications help the researcher understand and learn the principles of implementing an algorithm using the mapreduce programming pattern availability_and source_code is available at https the unprecedented abundance of sequence and other biological data generated in recent_years has been straining traditional analysis approaches a promising solution to the challenges of biological big_data is the hadoop ecosystem of distributed computing tools combined with a cloud service a hadoop system runs on a cluster of arbitrary size consisting of commodity computers it is based on a distributed file system and software implementing the mapreduce programming pattern a growing number of applications of hadoop mapreduce in bioinformatics have been recently reported reviewed by o setting up a working hadoop cluster remains a complex and time consuming process it can pose a considerable barrier to a bioinformatics researcher who is interested to learn about this new technology and test it on their favorite problem some excellent deployment and cluster management_tools already exist but they fall short when considering the specific needs of a researcher primarily interested in a quick and easy setup for experimentation and benchmarking for example tools targeting enterprise level clusters sacrifice simplicity for richness of features e g cloudera manager http www cloudera com content cloudera en products and servic es cloudera enterprise cloudera manager html and apache ambari http ambari apache org systems such as cloudgene and clouddoe have been specifically developed for bioinformatics applications however they focus on graphical_user and ease of use for end_users and do not work well for benchmarking in cases where multiple clusters of different sizes and settings need to be quickly deployed and redeployed amazon_web aws http aws amazon com offers the elastic mapreduce service which is easy to use but has no built in data persistence and software customization is complex we set out to develop a tool for hadoop cluster deployment and management which specifically addresses the needs of bioinformaticians exploring the applicability of this technology to their research features of the tool that we considered critical included rapid and simple creation of new clusters of different sizes flexible configuration and custom software installation data persistence during intermittent usage and low_cost of initial investment and during v c the author published_by we have developed cl dash as an easy to use hadoop deployment method to facilitate development and benchmarking of bioinformatics applications that use hadoop technology as a learning system it offers a straightforward introduction to the student with minimal investment of time and money a working cluster can be set up and sample applications can be run and analyzed used as a research system it allows prototyping on a small cluster followed by benchmarking on multiple clusters of widely varying sizes the scaling up and down of computing capacity is a built in feature of the system and is available with no up front costs one apparent limitation of the system is its dependence on the commercial aws service however the benefits of low_cost shallow learning_curve and flexibility make aws a prime choice for the common use cases described above we have routinely used cl dash in our own research into developing novel big_data tools for bioinformatics for example we have explored the feasibility of the hadoop framework to store manage and analyze large_scale human genomic_variation data we have found the system to be ideally_suited for a highly_dynamic work environment focused on experimentation conflict of interest none declared
