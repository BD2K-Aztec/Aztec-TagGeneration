proper evaluation of alignment_free network comparison methods motivation network comparison is a computationally_intractable problem with important_applications in systems_biology and other domains a key challenge is to properly quantify similarity between wiring patterns of two networks in an alignment_free fashion also alignment_based exist that aim to identify an actual node mapping between networks and as such serve a different purpose various alignment_free that use different global network_properties e g degree_distribution have been proposed methods based on small local subgraphs called graphlets perform the best in the alignment_free network comparison task due to high_level of topological detail that graphlets can capture among different graphlet based_methods graphlet correlation distance gcd was shown to be the most accurate for comparing networks recently a new graphlet based method called netdis was proposed which was claimed to be superior we argue against this as the performance of netdis was not properly_evaluated to position it correctly among the other alignment_free results we evaluate the performance of available alignment_free network comparison methods including gcd and netdis we do this by measuring accuracy of each method in a systematic precision_recall framework in terms of how well the method can group cluster topologically similar networks by testing this on both synthetic and real_world networks from different domains we show that gcd remains the most accurate noise tolerant and computationally_efficient alignment_free method that is we show that netdis does not outperform the other methods as originally claimed while it is also computationally more expensive furthermore since netdis is dependent on the choice of a network null_model unlike the other graphlet based_methods we show that its performance is highly_sensitive to the choice of this parameter finally we find that its performance is not independent on network sizes and densities as originally claimed networks or graphs are widely used for representing different types of relational data in the cell such as proteinprotein genetic metabolic and gene regulatory_interactions the information_encoded in the wiring patterns i e topology or structure of biological_networks complements the information obtained from protein_sequence and structure because of this graph_theoretic analyses of biological_networks can advance_our of fundamental cellular functioning when analysing biological_networks one needs to compare them for example evolutionary insights can be gained by identifying topological similarities between networks of different species the difficulty is that network comparison is computationally_intractable so heuristic approaches that produce approximate solutions are the only feasible way to compare networks depending on the purpose of the network comparison relevant approaches can be split into two major sub categories i alignmentbased network comparison and ii alignment_free network comparison alignment_based aim to find a mapping between the nodes of two or more networks that preserves many edges and a large subgraph between the networks these methods are useful for identifying the evolutionary_conserved parts of biological_networks and they enable the transfer of functional_annotations between aligned network regions across species saraph and milenkovic milenkovic and the identification of structural_similarities between proteins malod on the other hand alignment_free network comparison methods aim to quantify the overall topological_similarity between networks irrespective of node mappings between the networks and without intending to identify any conserved edges or subgraphs these methods have applications in evaluating the fit of a random_network model to a real_world network tracking the dynamics of time series networks or grouping clustering of networks based on their topological similarities the clustering can be used to reconstruct phylogenetic_relationships of species based on similarities of their networks alignment_free network comparison methods are typically computationally less expensive than alignment_based and again they do not produce a node mapping between the compared networks but a score that quantifies the overall similarity between the two networks as such alignment_free and alignment based network comparison methods have different purposes thus comparing the approaches across the two groups might be misleading of alignment_free network comparison methods earlier approaches use network_properties such as degree_distribution clustering_coefficient diameter and graph spectra for quantifying the overall similarity between two networks currently the best alignment_free network comparison method is based on graphlets small subgraphs of large_networks called graphlet correlation distance gcd gcd was systematically compared both with graphletbased and non graphlet based alignment_free predecessors and it was shown to be the most accurate in clustering topologically similar networks the most noise tolerant and the most computationally_efficient subsequently another graphlet based alignment_free method called netdis was proposed although the suggested methodology of netdis is interesting section the claimed superior_performance of netdis over the existing state_ofthe network comparison methods is questionable this is because the performance of netdis was not systematically evaluated so its claimed superiority might be inaccurate for example netdis was not compared against gcd also its comparison against an alignment based method based on which almost all conclusions of its superiority were drawn is inappropriate as argued above further potential fallacies with the netdis method itself exist such as its dependence on the choice of a network null_model which was not taken into account in the original netdis study thus here we systematically and fairly evaluate the performance of netdis in comparison to other alignment_free network comparison methods and address all issues present in the paper by we systematically comprehensively and fairly compare available alignment_free network comparison methods positioning netdis correctly among other existing_approaches we observe that netdis the newest graphlet based_approach for comparing networks does not perform as well as gcd in clustering networks with similar topologies and it is also computationally more expensive than previous graphlet based_approaches furthermore netdis is highly_sensitive to the choice on the gold_standard network that it uses and this makes it impractical this is because a well fitting network null_model is hard to determine and differs for most real_world networks and therefore it is not possible to choose a theoretically wellfounded gold_standard network for netdis comparison of realworld networks especially because each of the compared networks might require a different gold_standard network hence gcd is still the best performing alignment_free network comparison method to date which is also highly_efficient and not dependent on any network null_models these make gcd a natural choice in alignmentfree network comparison performance of gcd and netdis in terms_of running_times are shown when increasing a the number b the size number of nodes and c the density of the compared networks note that both axes are in logarithmic scale
