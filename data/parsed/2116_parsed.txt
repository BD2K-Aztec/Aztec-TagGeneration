graphclust alignment_free structural clustering of local rna_secondary motivation clustering according to sequencestructure similarity has now become a generally_accepted scheme for ncrna annotation its application to complete genomic_sequences as well as whole transcriptomes is therefore desirable but hindered by extremely_high computational costs results we present a novel linear time alignment_free method for comparing and clustering rnas according to sequence and structure the approach scales to datasets of hundreds of thousands of sequences the quality of the retrieved clusters has been benchmarked against known ncrna datasets and is comparable to state of the art sequencestructure methods although achieving speedups of several orders_of a selection of applications aiming at the detection of novel structural ncrnas are presented exemplarily we predicted local structural_elements specific to lincrnas likely functionally associating involved transcripts to vital processes of the human nervous_system in total we predicted local structural rna_elements in recent_years tiling arrays and high_throughput have strikingly driven the discovery of novel transcripts of which an outstanding amount is not translated into proteins encode_project these non protein_coding ncrnas have moved to a key research in molecular_biology fundamentally challenging established paradigms and rapidly transforming our perception of genome complexity there is mounting evidence that the eukaryotic_genome is pervasively transcribed and that ncrnas function at various levels regulating gene_expression and cell_biology recent_advances in the computational de_novo prediction of ncrnas enabling genome_wide analysis have uncovered a wealth of signals for potentially novel ncrnas in genomic_sequences from basically all kingdoms of life examples_include metazoans with thousands of predicted ncrna signals in human fish or insects consequently the prediction comparison and functional_annotation of ncrnas are major tasks of current rna research annotation of ncrnas however is still not part of generic annotation_pipelines of genome or next_generation data and precise functional_annotations of the majority of predictions remain_elusive one of the major reasons for the multitude of unannotated ncrnas is that in contrast to protein_coding ncrnas belong to a diverse_array of classes with vastly different structures functions and evolutionary_patterns albeit their heterogeneity ncrnas can be divided_into rna_families according to inherent functional structural or compositional similarities today the rfam database already lists different rna_families in contrast to rna_families an rna class groups together ncrnas whose members have no discernible homology at the sequence level but still share_common structural_and prominent examples are the two distinct classes of snornas box h aca and box c d and micro_rnas mirnas since an rna class consists of rna with similar structure and function clustering according to sequencestructure similarity has now become a generally_accepted scheme for ncrnas annotation the quality and complexity of the clusters are however largely determined by the pairwise sequence comparison method the most generic methods as introduced with locarna and foldalign use derivates of the full sankoff algorithm of simultaneous alignment and folding they suffer however from a very high_computational at least o n in time and are thus limited to relative small sequence_sets as poignantly stated by even using substantially more sophisticated techniques genome_scale ncrna analyses often consume tens to hundreds of computer years these high computational costs are one reason why ncrna gene_finding is still in its infancy for this reason many approaches use different heuristics to achieve a reasonable trade_off between time and quality oversimplifying and without completeness given the variety of approaches present in literature one can distinguish two main classes of clustering_approaches the first class uses simplifications in the representation of structures use comparison tools that consider single predicted structures such as rnaforester or marna these comparison approaches heavily depend on the correctness of the structure although computational_prediction of secondary_structures are known to be error_prone other approaches such asuse simplified structural_models to some extend the work bycan also be listed under this class as they use an approximate measure between two structural rnas scfg models for clustering hits found by evofold we introduced for the first time an ultra_fast pipeline for large_scale comparison and clustering of rnas according to sequence and structure which is key to the functional_annotation of ncrnas strikingly its core steps are alignment_free as clearly indicated by the result the approach is linear in time and thus scales to sets of hundreds of thousands of sequences the largest dataset we considered in this study consists of thousand sequences and they can be clustered by the proposed pipeline on a single computer in days furthermore we have parallelized phases of the pipeline this allows to reduce the run time for clustering the rfam seed sequences from to h when compared with the time required by an efficient pairwise sequencestructure alignment namely locarna we observe a fold speedup it indeed took us days to perform the clustering based on this state of the art complete all against all sequence structure comparison we have integrated the alignment_free clustering approach in a pipeline that uses locarna and infernal to improve the initial clusters found by a neighborhood search the latter now allows us for the first time to compile rna classes of ncrna and determine associated consensus structures for large_scale datasets without resorting to alignment based clustering this is important as it is known that sequence_alignments often fail at pairwise sequence_identities below in addition our pipeline exhibits an anytime characteristics as we do not need to produce a complete hierarchical cluster tree which is a computational bottleneck for large_datasets in contrast we output as many best clusters as wanted by the user the overall complexity of our pipeline is to a large extend determined by the number of reported clusters we have evaluated the approach on several benchmark sets consisting of rfam seed alignments evofam families and known bacterial ncrna here we achieve a high overall clustering quality even if the known rna signal is embedded in flanking context to further elucidate the capacity of our approach we have also clustered datasets where no clustering approach has been applied so_far by processing the complete dataset to generate its density landscape our method in particular enables us to likely detect previously missed structural_classes the screens of this pilot_study only consisted of sequences from a single_genome thus we can cluster only rna genes that are present in multiple copies within a genome this implies that most i
