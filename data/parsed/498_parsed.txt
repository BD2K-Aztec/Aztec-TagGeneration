a sequence comparison and gene_expression data_integration add on for the pathway tools software we present a plug in for pathway tools an integrated systems_biology software to create maintain and query pathway genome_databases fully integrated into the graphical_user and menu this plug in extends the applications functionality by the ability to create multiple_sequence systematically annotate insertion_sequence is elements and analyse their activity by cross_species comparison tools microarray probes can be automatically mapped to target_genes and expression data obtained with these arrays can be transformed into input_formats needed to visualize them in the various omics viewers of pathway tools the plug in api itself allows developers to integrate their own functions into the pathway tools menu availability binaries are freely_available users at http genome tugraz at pgdbtoolbox and can be used on all platforms supported by pathway tools a user guide is freely_available at pathway genome_databases pgdbs are highly_integrated model_organism databases that store genome_sequence and annotation as well as a reconstruction of the metabolic and regulatory_network well curated pgdbs like ecocyc are an important tool to gain better understanding of cellular_component interaction and how changes in an organisms network affect its phenotype pgdbs are usually maintained queried and visualized using the pathway tools software developed by the bioinformatics_research group at sri international which has extensive capabilities in the fields of operon and pathway prediction analysis of biological_networks species comparison and analysis of omics_datasets the importance of pgdbs to biochemical research is reflected by an ever growing number of pgdb collections and software_tools maintaining and analysing such databases our toolbox aims at further extending the capabilities of pgdb based systems_biology research by means of plug_ins that can be added to the pathway tools software to address special aspects of analytical workflows not covered by the core software itself multiple_sequence of orthologous_genes across related organisms including a freely defined sequence region allow detecting differences in gene promoter or regulator binding regions that affect gene function or expression systematic annotation of insertion_sequence is elements combined with cross_species comparison functions provides insight into transposon activity and gene_clusters affected thereof tools for mapping microarray probes to target genomes and visualizing expression_profiles in the genome_browser are provided these tools also create input_files for data visualization in pathway tools various overview diagrams
