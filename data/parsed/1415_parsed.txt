systems_biology discriminating response groups in metabolic and regulatory_pathway networks motivation analysis of omics experiments generates lists of entities genes metabolites etc selected based on specific behavior such as changes in response to stress or other signals functional_interpretation of these lists often uses category enrichment tests using functional_annotations like gene_ontology and pathway membership this approach does not consider the connected structure of biochemical_pathways or the causal directionality of events results the omics response group org method described in this work interprets omics lists in the context of metabolic_pathway and regulatory_networks using a statistical_model for flow within the networks statistical results for all response groups are visualized in a novel pathway flow plot the statistical_tests are based on the erlang distribution model under the assumption of independent and identically exponential distributed random_walk flows through pathways as a proof_of we applied our method to an escherichia_coli transcriptomics dataset where we confirmed common knowledge of the e coli transcriptional_response to lipid a deprivation the main response is related to osmotic_stress and we were also able to detect novel responses that are supported by the literature we also applied our method to an arabidopsis_thaliana expression dataset from an abscisic_acid study in both cases conventional pathway enrichment tests detected nothing while our approach discovered biological_processes beyond the original studies availability we created a prototype for an interactive org web_tool atanalysis of omics experiments generates lists of entities genes metabolites etc selected based on specific behavior these lists are then analyzed using existing functional knowledge of the entities in a list by further listing the functional_annotations assigned to to whom correspondence should be addressed the members of the list category enrichment_analysis generally refers to testing_the that the distribution of functional_annotation in the entity list is similar to the distribution of functional_annotation for all entities if the null_hypothesis is rejected one or more of the functional_annotations in the entity list is either over or underrepresented and a general functional response is inferred for the experimental treatment most biologists mine a number of sets of genes from results that exhibit an expected behavior of biological interest these sets are mapped to functional_annotation to determine which functions are associated with the behavior in the experiment for example a gene_expression assay might be conducting on samples for both a stress_condition and a control the genes which are upregulated by a certain fold_change are selected to comprise the gene_set of interest and all genes are mapped to zero or more gene_ontology the proportion of each term represented in the upregulated gene_set is compared with its proportion in the general_population of genes alternative_methods compare estimates of the expression distributions across treatments to mine category related effects much biological_knowledge is represented as networks whether it is ontological regulatory regulondb or metabolic kegg pathwaytools biocyc and plant metabolic_network this makes functional analysis much more complex than simple set comparisons requiring more complex tools like mapman array kegg or kegg spider to name a few a main_problem is that pathway mining is treated as a category enrichment problem based on pathway membership alone such an approach fails to consider the interconnectivity and reactive relationships between different entities reactions and pathways further category enrichment cannot directly infer causality if a functional_annotation term is enriched in an entity list we cannot determine_whether the functional process affects the omics entities or the omics entities affect the process other methods like nayak and de partition pathway networks but stop where our method operates discriminating pathway partitions or response groups our pathway mining method does not attempt to cluster or partition the networkit assumes it has already by partitioned into response groups with respect to comparing networks or parts of networks many stochastic and flow based_methods for processing networks assumewe took a subset of expression data from work investigating fab genes roles in e coli cell_membrane homeostasis and uncovered new insights supported by the literature we clearly saw activity relevant to the cells boundary envelope and periplasm which is consistent with our understanding of the utility of lipid a likewise the set of upregulated a thaliana genes under aba exposure tested significantly connected to stress related responses we compared results to two category enrichment testing methods where pathway membership according to respective biocyc databases was used to assign categories hypergeometric tests a simple approach which tests for category overrepresentation in the query list and the mrpp method which tests multivariate distributions of expression across categories and has been shown to perform better than other methods our org method detected pathways which fit existing_literature while these methods detected none which illustrates the main_problem we set out to ameliorate category
