genome_analysis methylc track visual integration of single_base dna_methylation data on the washu epigenome browser we present methylc track an efficient mechanism for visualizing single_base dna_methylation data on a genome_browser the methylc track dynamically integrates the level of methylation the position and context of the methylated cytosine i e cg chg and chh strand and confidence_level e g read_coverage depth in the case of whole_genome bisulfite sequencing_data investigators can access and integrate these information visually at specific locus or at the genome_wide level on the washu epigenome browser in the context of other rich epigenomic datasets availability_and the methylc track is part of the washu epigenome browser which is open_source and freely_available epigenomegateway wustl edu browser the most up to date instructions and tools for preparing methylc track are available atdna methylation is a well studied epigenetic mark it plays crucial roles in development gene_regulation chromatin_structure imprinting and many diseases dna_methylation primarily occurs as methylcytosine in the cpg context in specific_cell such as embryonic_stem escs methylcytosine sometimes occurs in the context of chg and chh h is a t or c usually cpg_methylation is symmetrical between the two dna_strands but hemimethylation where only one strand is methylated can be observed several modern techniques measure dna_methylation at single_base including whole_genome wgbs or methylc seq reduced_representation rrbs and illumina_infinium arrays bisulfite_sequencing based_methods can provide information including non cpg menthylation strand specific methylation and confidence_level read_depth and are considered_the in the field arrays only cg methylation_level is necessary data_files are compressed indexed by tabix and hosted on web_servers the bedgraph file urls are organized into a single methylc track using json and displayed via the datahub mechanism http epigenomegateway wustl edu hub to illustrate the different visualization options we displayed infinium rrbs and wgbs of esc h h esc and wgbs of imr cells in the sparseness of infinium and rrbs is visually obvious and unmethylated cpgs are visually distinct from cpgs with no value compared with infinium and rrbs data wgbs clearly reveals more dynamics of dna_methylation across the regions and between the samples both h esc and imr are lowly methylated over the hoxa gene_cluster a region with elevated methylation in imr is marked by a black_box it lies at the boundary of two chromatin domains supplementary the methylation increase correlates with the bipartite histone_modification pattern over hoxa cluster in imr shows the wgbs data with two dna_strands combined displays a zoomed out view after combining data of the two strands where the prevalence of noncpg methylation in h esc can be easily appreciated the methylc track on washu epigenome browser contributes simple but powerful innovations for visually exploring genome_wide single_base dna_methylation data the track is easy to prepare using standard bedgraph format files and is compatible with most common genomics tools the track design is highly_flexible and can be easily extended to incorporate new aspects of dna_methylation including allelic methylation hydroxymethylation and other complex genomics datasets
