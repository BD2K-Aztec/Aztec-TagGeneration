structural_bioinformatics incorporating post_translational and unnatural amino_acids into high_throughput modeling of protein_structures motivation accurately predicting protein side chain conformations is an important subproblem of the broader protein_structure prediction_problem several methods exist for generating fairly accurate_models for moderate_size proteins in seconds or less however a major_limitation of these methods is their inability to model post_translational ptms and unnatural amino_acids in natural living_systems the chemical_groups added following translation are often critical for the function of the protein in engineered systems unnatural amino_acids are incorporated into proteins to explore structure_function and create novel proteins results we present a new version of sidepro to predict the side_chains of proteins containing non standard amino_acids including of the most frequently observed ptms in the protein_data and all types of phosphorylation sidepro uses energy_functions that are parameterized by neural_networks trained from available data for ptms the and accuracies are comparable with those obtained for the precursor amino_acid and so are the rmsd values for the atoms shared with the precursor amino_acid in addition sidepro can accommodate any ptm or unnatural_amino thus providing a flexible prediction system for high_throughput modeling of proteins beyond the standard amino_acids availability_and sidepro programs and web_server rotamer libraries and data are available through the scratch suite of protein_structure predictors atpost translational modifications ptms are critical to the function of many proteins in living_systems and understanding their effects at the molecular level is important for both basic_and in biology and medicine to further this understanding open databases of curated ptm information have been published for instance phospho elm is a publicly_available database dedicated to phosphorylation the database provides the exact positions of experimentally_determined phosphorylation_sites as well as information on the specific kinases that produce the modifications other databases such as phosphositeplus hprd and phosida include information on additional types of ptms e g ubiquitination acetylation methylation but are still dominated by phosphorylation data an automated curator of information on ptms found in swiss_prot provides the following summary_statistics there are a total of ptms determined by experimental methods with the following types having a frequency phosphorylation acetylation n linked glycosylation amidation hydroxylation methylation o linked glycosylation ubiquitylation and pyrrolidone carboxylic_acid in addition to methods for curating and organizing existing ptm data there are also methods for predicting which sites are modified in sequences with unknown ptm status these methods typically use supervised machine_learning statistical and motif based_approaches to predict sites of phosphorylation acetylation glycosylation sumoylation and less common types of ptms as well some of these methods predict both the specific phosphorylated sites and the specific kinases responsible for the phosphorylation in contrast with these approaches the fundamental problem of predicting accurate three_dimensional d models of ptms in proteins has been largely ignored none of the widely used or recently_published side chain prediction_methods that are free for academic_research are capable of incorporating ptms or unnatural amino_acids into their predictions the widely used templatebased modeling software modeller allows for manual creation of custom residues however the process for doing so is somewhat cumbersome and not realistic for most modeller users one notable_exception is the incorporation of non canonical amino_acids into rosetta for computational proteinpeptide interface design the developers of side chain prediction_methods recognize the need for generating accurate_models that incorporate ptms however there are a number of practical challenges that have stymied progress in this area i there are far less data in the protein_data pdb for ptm to whom correspondence should be addressed residues than native residues for building rotamer libraries or developing statistical_potentials ii although one character codes e g a for alanine work well for efficiently defining protein_sequences it is unfeasible to use one character codes for all possible ptms there are ptms documented in the literature iii some important modifications e g o linked glycosylation correspond to broad classes of chemical_structures rather than a unique chemical_structure and each of the possible molecules would need to be uniquely identified and iv modified residues are generally larger and contain more rotatable bonds than their natural counterparts beyond the standard amino_acids and their ptms there are also other natural or synthetic amino_acids that can be incorporated into proteins two additional natural amino_acids selenocysteine sec u and pyrrolysine pyl o are coded in some species by codons that are usually interpreted as stop_codons pyrrolysine for instance is used by some methanogenic_archaea in enzymes used to produce methane in addition unnatural amino_acids have been incorporated into proteins through synthetic_biology projects often by creating a unique codon recoding and a corresponding transfer_rna to explore protein_structure and function and create novel proteins a tool for modeling the side_chains of these rare natural or unnatural amino_acids would also be desirable thus despite the challenges described above we have taken on the problem of rapidly generating reasonably accurate d side chain models of proteins that incorporate amino_acids beyond the standard amino_acids in the remainder of this article the term non standard amino_acid nsa is used to refer to any amino_acid other than the standard amino_acids this includes ptms rare natural amino_acids and unnatural amino_acids we evaluate the approach using three standard metrics i rmsd for the side chain which is calculated using the coordinates of the experimental structure exactly as described in the strength of sidepro is that it uses the wealth of data in the pdb to learn energy_functions parameterized by neural_networks to model and predict protein side chain conformations in this study we have extended the capabilities of sidepro to ptms and nsas for natural amino_acids and fptms when sufficient training examples are available sidepro uses amino_acid specific energy_functions for all other ptms and nsas sidepro uses a generic energy function to flexibly accommodate for any nsa sidepro allow users to provide d structures of nsas to be incorporated into sidepro models alternatively the cosmos program is used to predict these structures and any other similar program e g openbabel ocan be used for the same purposes the generic neural_networks trained on all possible pairs of atom types agnostic of residue type are used to score the atomatom interactions for these nsas naturally as more data on nsas become available in the pdb it will be possible to further expand the set of specific energy_functions thereby increasing the accuracy of the program over time as demonstrated here for some of the nsas accuracy can also be improved by increasing the number of d samples produced by cosmos at the expense of time finally sidepro is to be used in protein_structure and engineering projects for the rapid prediction of side_chains conformations in high_throughput mode or to provide good starting points for molecular or quantum_mechanics simulations of side chain atoms for both standard and non standard amino_acids
