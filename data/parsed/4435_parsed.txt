data_and stratifying tumour subtypes based on copy_number profiles using next generation sequence_data motivation the role of personalized_medicine and target treatment in the clinical_management of cancer patients has become increasingly important in recent_years this has made the task of precise histological substratification of cancers crucial increasingly genomic_data are being seen as a valuable classifier specifically copy_number cna profiles generated by next_generation ngs can become a determinant for tumours subtyping the principle purpose of this study is to devise a model with good prediction capability for the tumours histological_subtypes as a function of both the patients covariates and their genome_wide cna profiles from ngs_data results we investigate a logistic_regression for modelling tumour histological_subtypes as a function of the patients covariates and their cna profiles in a mixed model framework the covariates such as age_and are considered as fixed predictors and the genome_wide cna profiles are considered as random predictors we illustrate the application of this model in lung and oral_cancer datasets and the results indicate that the tumour histological_subtypes can be modelled with a good fit our cross_validation indicates that the logistic_regression exhibits the best prediction relative to other classification methods we considered in this study the model also exhibits the best agreement in the prediction between smooth segmented and circular binary segmented cna profiles availability_and an r package to run a logistic_regression is available innext generation sequencing ngs_technology has greatly transformed our way of interrogating genomes and advanced our understanding of genomic changes such as copy_number cnas we have previously shown that cna data can be generated from routine_diagnostic biopsy_specimens in a very efficient manner using multiplexed low_coverage and developed a robust algorithm to analyse these data in individual patients our objective in this current study is to analyse multiple samples from two tumour subtypessimultaneously and develop informatic techniques to separate them using their cna profiles so that subsequent patients could be better stratified in a predictive manner currently methods for studying groups of cna profiles tend to focus on looking for similarities in a homogeneous group of samples or to look for regions of the genome where two groups of samples are very different we are focusing less on the genomic_regions involved and more on the problem of separating similar groups of samples and predicting to which group a new sample belongs more specifically our focus is in utilizing the whole genome_wide cna profiles to stratify tumour subtypes in addition to other covariates or patients characteristics this strategy enables us to have a wider picture of the contribution of each genomic_region in the stratification in light of the contribution of the other regions to model the tumour subtypes we investigate logistic_regression within a random_effects framework where the contributions of patients clinical_characteristics are considered as fixed_effects and those of the cna profiles are considered as random_effects because our interest is in the prediction of tumour subtypes of new samples we perform a cross_validation to identify the prediction_error of the model we compare this prediction_error with those from other classification methods as a test_dataset we have analysed a cohort of lung tumours all of which are from the two closely_related subtypes squamous_cell scc and adenocarcinoma adc until recently these have been treated as part of the larger subgroup non_small nsclc but there is growing evidence that the two groups should be treated as separate diseases as a validation dataset we analysed another cohort of two related tumour subtypes oral_squamous oscc and oral verrucous_carcinoma ovc these subtypes have very different prognoses and clinical_management but there can be histological uncertainty in distinguishing between them the results of our analysis indicate that the logistic_regression enables us to stratify tumour subtypes and investigate genome_wide contribution of each genomic_region to the stratification the results also indicate that the logistic_regression has good predictive value for new samples advantageously this prediction is achieved regardless of the segmentation_methods involved in the estimation of cna the latter advantage is important because a number of tools exist to obtain cna estimates from ngs_data and they use a variety of pre_processing such as normalization and a number of different segmentation_methods before we discuss those results we discuss first the logistic_regression in the next section in this section we mainly present the results for the lung_cancer dataset for the oral_cancer dataset we present its results mainly in the supplementary_material in predicting tumour histology the main_challenge is to consider a model with low classification error further than that we are also interested in the agreement between smooth and cbs segmented cna profiles in the prediction of new tumour sample this is critical when we consider that the cna profiles are derived from lowcoverage ngs_data that have undergone several preparation steps this includes but is not limited to mapping to the reference_genome filtering optimal window estimation normalization including normalization due to contamination and segmentation to have a classification_method with a good prediction while having a minimum dependency on a previous pre_processing is a great advantage the logistic_regression described in section also known as tikhonov_regularization is well known to tend to group variables genomic window together this property of the observed tumour histology against its model_fit based on the full logistic

figures with k k are presented in the supplementary_material the significance of the classification error between pair of methods are also presented in the supplementary_material that have significant differences of cna profiles between the squamous and adc groups using a permutation method a more detailed view of the random_effects estimates in each chromosome is presented in the supplementary_material the logistic_regression is likely to predominate in prediction in terms of classification error and agreement between the segmentation_methods because there are some dependencies of cna between neighbouring genomic windows the lasso and elastic_net models achieve comparable classification error as the logistic_regression only when the cna profiles are cbs segmented the cbs dnacopy segmentation generally outputs long segments and the variable_selection effect that the two methods produce does not impair the prediction because the genomic_regions that survive the penalization are able to represent the information of the whole segment we have demonstrated the ability of the proposed method to distinguish between two subtypes of lung_cancer we then validated this method in a separate cohort of oral_cancer patients whose diagnosis is not always straightforward but whose prognosis is very different however in theory it could be used to distinguish between any subtypes of tumour or to make predictions about disease_progression drug_resistance or outcome currently several molecular classifiers are used to distinguish cancer_subtypes among them mrna or protein expression these are both selective methods the study of mrna usually involved the removal of non coding rna and micro_rna the roles of which are increasingly becoming apparent the study of protein expression usually involves only a few known proteins both of these methods will also involve further depletion of valuable sample material where there is no known mrna or protein signature our method may prove useful in finding previously_unsuspected differences in the genomes of two sample groups low_coverage is also possible with extremely_low quantities of badly degraded dna if mrna or protein tests are available then their results can be easily added to the logistic regression_method as additional predictors and will further improve performance we have investigated that the use of logistic_regression to model tumour histology and include the genome_wide cna profiles as predictors the model enables us to include clinical_characteristics as fixed covariates and cna profiles as random predictors in a single modelling framework the model exhibits a good fit and in a cross_validation shows minimal classification error the model also demonstrates the best agreement in prediction between cna profiles produced by two very different segmentation_methods classification error from cross_validations and observations in the training_set and validation_set
