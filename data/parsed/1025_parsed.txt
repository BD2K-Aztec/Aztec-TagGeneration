cnvruler a copy_number based case_control analysis tool the method for genome_wide gwas based on copy_number cnv is not as well established as that for single_nucleotide snp gwas although there are several tools for cnv association studies most of them do not provide appropriate definitions of cnv regions cnvrs which are essential for cnv association studies here we present a user_friendly program called cnvruler for cnv association studies outputs from the most common cnv defining algorithms can be directly used as input_files for determining the three different definitions of cnvrs once cnvrs are defined cnvruler supports four kinds of statistical_association tests and options for population_stratification cnvruler is based on the open_source programs r and java from sun microsystems availability cnvruler software is available with an online manual at the website www ircgp com cnvruler index html contact yejun catholic ac kr copy_number cnv is thought to contribute to interindividual_differences in phenotypes including disease_susceptibility single_nucleotide snp genotypes are always represented as categorical values while copy_number cnvs are often represented as regions consisting of continuous values for consecutive probes for this reason the following three steps are required to perform a cnv based genome_wide gwas i calling cnvs ii merging cnvs into common cnv regions cnvrs and iii statistical_analysis of the associations despite the importance and popularity of cnv phenotype association studies there are not many algorithms that provide all three key_steps mentioned above the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as to whom correspondence should be addressed a number of tools supporting cnvdisease association analysis have been developed supplementary however most of these tools do not offer methods for defining the cnvrs and require additional manual processes for converting the input cnv_calls into files suitable for statistical_analysis in order to support the steps from merging cnvs into cnvrs to cnvr based association analysis in a single software_program we developed a user_friendly for cnvgwas called cnvruler cnvruler is a user_friendly program with multiple functions that support all procedures of cnvphenotype association analysis in a single system without requiring any additional manual processes
