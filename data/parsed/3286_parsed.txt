systems_biology nova a software to analyze complexome profiling data we introduce nova a software for the analysis of complexome profiling data nova supports the investigation of the composition of complexes cluster_analysis of the experimental_data visual_inspection and comparison of experiments and many other features availability_and nova is licensed under the artistic license it is freely_available www bioinformatik uni frankfurt de nova requires at least java and runs under linux microsoft windows and mac os to facilitate diverse_cellular proteins can associate to form complex molecular machineries complexome profiling cp uses blue native gel_electrophoresis to separate intact proteins and protein_complexes up to a molecular_weight of mda or even mda using special large pore gels lp bne after the separation the gel strip is cut into equally sized slices migration profiles are reconstructed by applying mass_spectrometry lc_ms to identify the proteins contained in each slice the relative_abundance of each protein is calculated by label_free lc_ms based quantification through comparison of these profiles by hierarchical_clustering groups of co migrating proteins are recognized indicating the composition of quaternary_structures and functional complexes the method has been successfully_applied to analyze mitochondrial complexes in rats and humans as well as to explore complex formation in plants and bacteria typically experimental_datasets contain up to thousands of migration profiles which cannot be manually processed bioinformatic_tools are needed to efficiently handle and visualize these data though several programs like cluster java treeview or the multiexperiment viewer have been applied there is to the best of our knowledge no tool available that supplies all functionalities required for the visualization and evaluation of cp data
