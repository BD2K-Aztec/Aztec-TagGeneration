pathway discovery in metabolic_networks by subgraph extraction motivation subgraph extraction is a powerful technique to predict pathways from biological_networks and a set of query items e g genes proteins compounds etc it can be applied to a variety of different data types such as gene_expression protein levels operons or phylogenetic profiles in this article we investigate different approaches to extract relevant pathways from metabolic_networks although these approaches have been adapted to metabolic_networks they are generic enough to be adjusted to other biological_networks as well results we comparatively evaluated seven sub network extraction approaches on known metabolic_pathways from saccharomyces_cerevisiae and a metabolic_network obtained from metacyc the best performing approach is a novel hybrid strategy which combines a random_walk based reduction of the graph with a shortest_paths based algorithm and which recovers the reference pathways with an accuracy of availability most of the presented algorithms are available as part of the network_analysis tool set neat the kwalks method is released under the gpl license subgraph extraction can be used to predict a meaningful pathway given a biological_network e g proteinprotein_interaction or metabolic_network and a set of query items e g genes proteins and compounds defining seed nodes in the network van this methodology may serve to predict pathways from a variety of data types such as clusters of co expressed genes operons phylogenetic profiles or protein levels inferred pathways from a biological_network weighted according to gene_expression levels as measured with microarrays they construct a bipartite metabolic_network consisting of compound and reaction nodes and subsequently enumerate all possible paths between a source d glucose and a target_compound pyruvate under certain constraints the score of each path is computed on the basis of expression values of the genes catalyzing to whom correspondence should be addressed the enzymes involved in this path this method ranks predicted paths according to their degree of up or down_regulation extended this idea to the extraction of more complex non linear sub networks in proteinprotein and protein dna networks given yeast gene_expression data sub networks are considered active whenever they involve highly_expressed such sub networks can be identified by sampling the space of possible sub networks with simulated_annealing also search for sub networks in proteinprotein and proteindna_interaction networks given gene_expression data to our knowledge they are the first to apply algorithms solving the steiner tree problem on biological_networks in order to connect nodes of interest i e differentially_expressed rajagopalan and agarwal integrate various data_sources transfac humancyc and ingenuity pathways knowledge_base into a network of genemetabolite relationships query nodes in this network are connected by an algorithm based on breadth first search a key contribution of these authors is the systematic evaluation of their subgraph extraction approach on both simulated_data and known pathways taken from biocarta apply sub network extraction to proteomics_data i e enzyme level ratios measured by mass_spectrometry from the cyanobacterium nostoc a sub network is extracted from a weighted kegg metabolic_network by generating paths around each up regulated enzyme node up to a given maximal weight and subsequently filtering these paths according to the number of up regulated enzymes contained in them the filtered paths are then merged to form a network whose connected components are considered as the extracted sub networks identify high_scoring sub networks in proteinprotein_interaction with a strategy similar to by applying an algorithm that solves the steiner tree problem exactly interestingly their method allows to report sub optimal solutions with a user specified distance to previously listed solutions the pathway prediction approach is validated on simulated_data antonov and co workers predict metabolic_pathways from kegg data and from input genes or input compounds query nodes genes or compounds separated by one edge are added to a growing sub network that may consist of several components the component covering most query nodes is considered as the inferred pathway the procedure is repeated for distances of edges resulting in a set of distance specific predictions this sub network extraction procedure is available via two web_tools specific to metabolic data page in this article we presented different sub network extraction_techniques that can be applied to predict metabolic_pathways from metabolic_networks given a set of seed reactions from our evaluation we can conclude that a combination of takahashimatsuyama and kwalks is globally most suited the evaluation also shows that a directed weighted metabolic_network performs better than an undirected unweighted one consequently if a good weight policy for the metabolic_network under study is at hand it should be given as input to both algorithms else the paths based algorithm can be launched on the weights computed by kwalks the accuracy of pathway inference can be further increased by iterating kwalks and or by reducing the size of the sub network extracted by kwalks in the first step of the hybrid the hybrid approach_combines the strengths of two different sub network extraction strategies kwalks is designed to capture the part of a network that is most relevant to connect the given seed nodes resulting in a high_sensitivity but at the cost of a low ppv fps introduced by kwalks can be discarded by a more stringent shortest_paths based algorithm in addition combining shortest_paths based_algorithms with kwalks not only increases their accuracy but also their speed kwalks as the fastest of all tested algorithms quickly reduces the input network size and thus the runtime of the subsequent shortest_paths based algorithm our pathway prediction approach is subjected to a number of limitations paths based_approaches only partly infer cyclic or spiralshaped pathways the same enzymes acting repeatedly on a growing chain e g fatty_acid kwalks alone is able to return general subgraphs but possibly at the cost of decreasing specificity for certain pathways situated in the densely interconnected region of the metabolic_network such as the tca_cycle and the glycolysis pathway a large number of seed nodes is required in order to distinguish them from alternative_pathways in addition prediction_accuracy is of course dependent on data_quality to infer a metabolic_pathway from a metabolic_network the network must contain all nodes and edges of the pathway a strength of sub network extraction is its ability to handle large_networks several thousands of nodes efficiently the approach is sufficiently generic to be applied to any biological_network in addition it has a capacity to integrate other data e g scores from high_throughput experiments by weighting the network another strength is its capability to handle seed node groups which allows to cope with ambiguous gene reaction mappings the sub network extraction method proposed here is distinct from and complementary to other metabolic network_analysis methods such as flux_balance fba page or elementary mode em analysis those respective approaches differ by their input types output types and by their potential applications and can provide complementary insights into the metabolism of a given organism fba aims at predicting a set of feasible metabolic flux_distributions optimizing a specific objective such as biomass_production for a given organism in a specific environment fba requires as input a metabolic_network including stoichiometric coefficients plus an objective_function to constrain the number of solutions em analysis is similar to fba but does not require an objective_function thus it enumerates all allowable metabolic_states satisfying an additional non decomposability constraint these methods have important_applications in bioengineering especially for microbe based production of organic_molecules in contrast the presented method aims to predict metabolic_pathways given a metabolic_network and a set of seed nodes which can be compounds reactions or enzyme coding_genes seed genes can be collected from a variety of data_sources co expression clusters operons regulons synteny groups metabolomic_profiles or any other criterion suggesting that a set of enzyme coding_genes is potentially involved in a common function an immediate application of sub network extraction is to interpret expression profiles_obtained from microarray_data in order to understand the specific metabolic_processes that are up or downregulated in response to changed conditions another application is the inference of bacterial metabolic_pathways from genome_organization operons regulons and synteny and the analysis of cross_species pathway variants metabolic sub network extraction can be applied to predict metabolic_pathways for an organism whose genes are functionally annotated but whose metabolism is not yet known in such a case a network constructed from metabolic information taken from related organisms might be more appropriate than a complete metabolic_network containing all known reactions and compounds in a given database as in this study there are various ways to build and weight an organism specific metabolic_network the first is to simply build the network from reactions occurring in the selected set of organisms in a less restrictive approach the complete network could be weighted in such a way that reactions occurring in the given organisms are favored over other reactions similarly gene_expression and other high_throughput data could be taken into account during network construction by converting expression ratios or other scores derived from the dataset into node weights the pathway inference algorithms were added to neat at http rsat ulb ac be neat a generic kwalks implementation is freely_available at www ucl ac be mlg index php page softwares
