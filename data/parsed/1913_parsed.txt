sequence_analysis fusionhunter identifying fusion_transcripts in cancer using paired_end motivation fusion_transcripts can be created as a result of genome rearrangement in cancer some of them play_important in carcinogenesis and can serve as diagnostic and therapeutic_targets with more and more cancer_genomes being sequenced by next_generation we believe an efficient tool for reliably identifying fusion_transcripts will be desirable for many groups results we designed and implemented an open_source called fusionhunter which reliably identifies fusion_transcripts from transcriptional analysis of paired_end we show that fusionhunter can accurately detect fusions that were previously confirmed by rt_pcr in a publicly_available dataset the purpose of fusionhunter is to identify potential fusions with high_sensitivity and to guide further functional_validation in the laboratory one of the key features observed when analyzing cancer_genomes is the chromosomal_abnormality genome arrangements could result in aberrant fusion_genes and a number of them have been found to play_important in carcinogenesis different functional fusion_genes have been detected in both hematological_malignancies and solid_tumors precisely identifying these fusion_genes is important for developing potential diagnostic and therapeutic_targets recently rna_seq has proven to be a valuable_tool for transcriptome_profiling based upon ultra high_throughput nextgeneration_sequencing it has been shown that rnaseq is a more accurate method to survey the entire transcriptome in a quantitative and high_throughput fashion than microarray_technology and est sequencing rna_seq can provide a great_deal of information about genome_wide transcription including the identification of fusion_genes in cancer a number of novel fusion_genes has been identified using single_end rnaseq reads and paired_end rna_seq to whom correspondence should be addressed the advantage of pairedend technology is that it provides a more reliable way to uncover breakpoints when comparing two genomes however although a computational_pipeline that identifies fusion_transcripts using rna_seq has been mentioned in a number of recently_published cancer transcriptomic studies b there was no publicly_accessible opensource software available until a recently_published tool named fusionseq with more and more cancer transcriptomes being sequenced by next_generation we believe an efficient tool for reliably identifying fusion_transcripts will be desirable for many groups here we describe an opensource software_tool called fusionhunter that identifies fusion_transcripts in cancer using reads from paired_end this high_throughput software_tool is designed for efficient and precise detection of fusion_transcripts in cancer for further functional_validation in the laboratory recently several works have been published to detect splice_junctions and chimeric_transcripts based on rna_seq includingpage
