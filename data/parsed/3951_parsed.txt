databases_and refprotdom a protein database with improved domain boundaries and homology relationships refprotdom provides a set of divergent query domains originally selected from pfam and full_length proteins containing their homologous domains with diverse architectures for evaluating pair_wise and iterative sequence_similarity pfam homology and domain boundary annotations in the target library were supplemented using local and semi global searches psi blast_searches and scop and cath classifications availability refprotdom is available from http faculty virginia edu wrpearson fasta pubs gonzalez a contact evaluation and improvement of protein_sequence similarity_searches using algorithms such as blast or smith_waterman ssearch and more sophisticated searches such as psi_blast or hmmer require query_sequences and reference sets curated to accurately_reflect homology relationships because structural_similarity is preserved well beyond sequence_similarity protein_structures are often the gold_standard for annotating homology relationships although both structure based homology annotations and manually_annotated protein_sequence relationships can very accurately record homology relationships they do not reflect common practice in protein similarity searching which is to characterize unknown_proteins by searching large comprehensive protein_sets such as refseq and uniprot to better characterize similarity searching strategies in particular psi_blast performance against comprehensive protein databases we identified a set of diverse protein_domains from pfam v to use as queries against a set of real proteins containing those domains our query domain families are taxonomically broad to provide harder homology detection cases and have long models to better simulate full_length protein searches although we cannot be certain that all homologs have been found we believe that statistically_significant pair_wise alignments are annotated correctly to whom correspondence should be addressed were constructed and the members of these sets evaluated further i a challenging query subset hard with the lowest family coverage with blast and ii a randomly_sampled representative query set sampled with replacement annotation extensions when the original pfam v annotations were used to characterize searches with our hard and sampled queries against the target library thousands of alignments to very similar uniprot sequences e g e with identity were annotated as partial homologs or non homologs to correct these conservative annotations we compared the bare domain query_sequences to the target library using ssearch and glsearch a program that produces an alignment that is global in the query_sequence but possibly local in the target or library sequence we identified all the significantly similar sequence_regions e with ssearch that were either shorter or unannotated in pfam v and calculated the boundaries using glsearch we extended annotations on partial domains and added domain homology annotations based on ssearch alignments of which were included in pfam v refprotdom describes relationships and alignment boundaries between query domains and the target library homologs according to pfam v pfam v and the ssearch glsearch alignment boundaries although ssearch glsearch searches against the target library dramatically_reduced the number of apparent false_positives with very low e values additional searches with psi_blast using the queries sometimes found unrelated uniprot sequences with significant e scores we analyzed all significant e nonhomologous alignments found in the first three iterations of psi_blast for the queries distinct families non homologous alignments to regions with no annotated pfam domains were used as queries in reciprocal psi blast_searches for three iterations reciprocal searches that recovered at least of a domain_family were annotated as homologous yielding additional homology annotations across families structures of significant non homologs that mapped to unrelated pfam families were examined in scop and cath if they shared the same scop fold or cath topology they were annotated as homologs for example pfam annotates a
