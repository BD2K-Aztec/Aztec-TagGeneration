threadom extracting protein domain boundary information from multiple threading alignments motivation protein_domains are subunits that can fold and evolve independently identification of domain boundary locations is often the first step in protein_folding and function_annotations most of the current methods deduce domain boundaries by sequence_based analysis which has low accuracy there is no efficient method for predicting discontinuous domains that consist of segments from separated sequence_regions as template based_methods are most efficient for protein d structure modeling combining multiple threading alignment information should increase the accuracy and reliability of computational domain predictions result we developed a new protein domain predictor threadom which deduces domain boundary locations based on multiple threading alignments the core of the method development is the derivation of a domain conservation score that combines information from template domain structures and terminal and internal alignment gaps tested on non redundant sequences without using homologous templates threadom generates correct single and multi domain classifications in of cases where have the domain linker assigned within ae residues in a second test on proteins with discontinuous domains threadom achieves an average precision and recall in domain boundary prediction finally threadom was examined on targets from casp and had a domain overlap rate and with the target for free modeling hard multiple domain and discontinuous domain proteins respectively which are significantly_higher than most domain pre dictors in the casp similar results were achieved on the targets from the most recently casp and casp experiments protein molecules are composed of domains that fold function and evolve autonomously the definition of protein_domains is however not absolute recent_studies that protein_domains within the same family or superfamily can vary significantly in both structure and function nevertheless correct assignment of boundaries of the protein_domains is essential for the efficient elucidations of protein_function and evolutionary_mechanisms the most accurate characterization of protein_domains is through the analysis of the d structures however the experimental determination of protein_structures is often time and manpower expensive and some proteins are even impossible to solve currently the computational domain prediction from the amino_acid is therefore highly demanded a variety of methods have been recently_developed in this regard that can be roughly categorized into three groups statistical and machine_learning homology_based and d model based_methods the statistical and machine_learning based_methods are probably the most frequently used approaches to protein domain predictions with examples including dgs domcut armadillo pprodo dompro domnet drop dobo prodom adda and everest in the dgs domcut and armadillo programs the statistical regularities seen in the protein_data pdb structures including domain size_distribution and residue propensities are used to deduce the domain linker and boundary predictions in prodom adda and everest the domain boundaries are derived by large_scale sequence_comparisons followed by clustering analyses in the rest examples pprodo dompro domnet drop and dobo the residue based statistical_features together with the position_specific from psi blast_search are trained by machine_learning including neural_network support_vector and random_forest classifiers these methods deduce boundary information from sequence only which can in principle be applied to any proteins but the overall accuracy is low compared with the homology based_approaches in the homology based_methods e g pfam chop and fiefdom target_sequences are searched through known protein_structure or family libraries by hidden_markov hmm or psi_blast programs the domain boundary information is then obtained by mapping the domain information from the homologous templates or families following the sequence_alignments the homology based_methods can have a high_accuracy of predictions when close templates are identified but the accuracy decreases sharply when the sequence_identity of target and template is low e g in the d model based_methods e g snapdragon rosettadom and opus dom the authors first construct tertiary_structure models of the target by either ab_initio or knowledge based coarse_grained modeling simulations domain to whom correspondence should be addressed the author

original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com parser tools are then used to assign the domain information on the predicted d models the accuracy of domain assignments relies on the quality of the tertiary models which usually decreases with the size of the target_proteins because of the limited ability of ab_initio simulations having in mind the improved power of the template based protein_structure predictions and the increasing size of pdb we propose a new algorithm threadom based on multiple threading algorithms which aims to significantly improve the reliability of domain predictions in the category of distantly homologous protein targets although the threading based_algorithms have been successfully used in the casp experiments for modeling multiple domain protein_structures where the domain boundaries are usually decided by human intervened views and interpretations of multiple threading alignment profiles this is the first time to integrate the multiple threading algorithms into an automated pipeline for domain boundary determinations the key to the algorithm is the development of a sensitive domain boundary profile that can calibrate composite structural and sequence_alignment information from the multiple threading templates for precise domain assignment the method will be systematically benchmarked on large_scale proteins to examine the weaknesses and strengths in comparison with other widely used domain prediction_approaches
