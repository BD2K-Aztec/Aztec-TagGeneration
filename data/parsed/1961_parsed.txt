genefu an r bioconductor_package for computation of gene_expression based signatures in breast_cancer breast_cancer is one of the most frequent cancers among women extensive studies into the molecular_heterogeneity of breast_cancer have produced a plethora of molecular_subtype classification and prognosis prediction_algorithms as well as numerous gene_expression however reimplementation of these algorithms is a tedious but important task to enable comparison of existing signatures and classification_models between each other and with new models here we present the genefu r bioconductor_package a multi tiered compendium of bioinformatics algorithms and gene_signatures for molecular subtyping and prognostication in breast_cancer availability_and the genefu package is available from bioconductor breast_cancer is a devastating disease whose management is complicated by its high molecular_heterogeneity breast_cancer is categorized into at least four clinically_relevant molecular_subtypes that reflect upon expression levels of specific genes these are her enriched also called her triple_negative er her pr similar to basal like and luminal like which are mainly er her that could be further discriminated into luminal a and b based on their low and high_proliferative phenotype respectively these classifications have showed that breast_cancer is not a single disease but is rather highly_heterogeneous breast_cancer exhibit distinct transcriptomic patterns that are associated with outcome which emphasizes the relevance of these subtypes for basic and translational_research among various molecular_techniques gene_expression in particular has increasingly been used to refine breast_cancer stratification and to assess prognosis and response to therapy importantly the prognostic value of the vast_majority of these signatures were limited to luminal like breast_tumors calling for the development of subtype specific prognostic_models subtypespecific prognoses however are also largely dependent on the proper identification of the major biological subtypes the parallel development of breast_cancer subtyping methods has also produced a significant number of classification algorithms with diverse taxonomies the large body of literature on the molecular complexity of breast_cancer has introduced a burden of computational_complexity for researchers the advent_of genomics and next_generation promises unprecedented views into the major biological breast_cancer however there is a dire need for an accessible computational platform that can easily sustain the growing variety of breast_cancer classification and prognostic algorithms this will facilitate both meta_analyses of breast_cancer data as well as cross comparison of different computational_methods here we have developed the genefu package a multi leveled compendium that provides bioinformatics implementations of classification algorithms to identify molecular_subtypes as well as prognostic predictors along with their published gene_signatures supplementary notably we have incorporated the most recently_developed molecular subtyping algorithms in the field including the intclust the ihc prognostic scoring algorithm the absolute intrinsic molecular subypting aims algorithm as well as the classification algorithm for prediction of claudin low breast_cancer samples the package also includes other functions to facilitate quick manipulation of gene_expression including gene_selection and probegene mapping across microarray_platforms
