fastmotif spectral sequence motif_discovery motivation sequence discovery tools play_a in several fields of computational_biology in the framework of transcription_factor binding studies most of the existing motif_finding algorithms are computationally_demanding and they may not be able to support the increasingly large_datasets produced by modern high_throughput results we present fastmotif a new motif_discovery algorithm that is built on a recent machine_learning referred to as method of moments based on spectral decompositions our method is robust to model misspecifications and is not prone to locally optimal solutions we obtain an algorithm that is extremely fast and designed for the analysis of big sequencing_data on ht selex data fastmotif extracts motif profiles that match those computed by various state of the art algorithms but one order of magnitude faster we provide a theoretical and numerical_analysis of the algorithms robustness and discuss its sensitivity with respect to the free_parameters availability_and the matlab_code of fastmotif is available from http lcsb portal in the last decades due to the advent of new sequencing_technologies motif_discovery have become an essential tool in many computational_biology fields in cell_biology sequence motif_discovery plays a primary role in the understanding of gene_expression through the analysis of sequencing_data and the identification of dna transcription_factor various experimental_techniques are nowadays available to extract dna protein binding_sites in vivoand in vitro protein binding microarray pbm ht selex thanks to the quantity and quality of the generated data ht selex is considered one of the most promising high_throughput techniques for studying transcription_factor binding_affinity in vitro see the recent work for a quantitative_comparison between ht selex and other high_throughput techniques as chip in the ht selex protocol tens_of enriched dna_fragments are obtained through a series of incubation selection cycles in each cycle an initial pool containing randomized ligands of length_bp is incubated with an immobilized dna_binding bound ligands are amplified_by steps pcr sequenced and then used as initial pool for a next cycle until the pool is saturated due to the high but not exact specificity of transcription_factor binding_affinities enriched dna_fragments in a dataset typically contain similar but not exactly conserved instances of the same binding_motif this calls for algorithms that can extract simple and intuitive binding_motifs that are robust to such stochasticity in the simplest case the binding_preferences are modelled by means of consensus_sequences obtained by selecting a few deterministic character strings that are over represented in the dataset a more flexiblerepresentation is provided by position_weight pwm that describe binding_sites as probability_distributions over the dna alphabet based on the simplifying assumption that the total binding_energy is a site by site sum of single protein nucleobase interactions pwms are only approximate models of the true transcription_factor preferences a debate is still open on whether such an approximation gives a satisfactory picture of the dna protein interaction or it is a too simplified reduction of the real biological_process more sophisticated models that go beyond the pwm representation by taking_into multi base probability_distributions or long_distance interactions have been proposed and tested in the literature however in most cases these improvements did not bring about cogent evidence against the simpler and more intuitive approach based on position independent distributions in statistics and machine_learning factorized aka product distributions like pwms and their linear_combinations aka mixtures are commonly used in modelling empirical distributions from various kinds of data and an important problem is how to estimate such models from data in pioneering work showed that it is possible to infer a mixture of product distributions via the spectral decomposition of observable matrices i e matrices that can be estimated directly from the data using suitable combinations of the empirical joint probability_distributions extensions and improvements of this idea have been developed more recently in a series of remarkable works where the spectral approach is applied to a larger class of probability_distributions and robust versions of the original method have been analysed theoretically in this article we further develop the original spectral technique of chang and study its application to the problem of learning probabilistic motif profiles from noisy sequencing_data the key observation is that under the pwm approximation motif_discovery reduces to the more general_problem of learning a mixture of product distributions and hence it is possible to extract motif profiles from sequencing_data using usual spectral decompositions we present fastmotif a new motif_finding algorithm that is faster than other sequence discovery tools and is designed for processing noisy high_throughput datasets based on a new and more stable version of the spectral techniques introduced in our algorithm is robust to model_misspecification is not prone to local_optima and it can be adapted to searching for motifs of arbitrary length in addition the method is completely general and upon minor modifications can be used for sequence discovery over any sequence alphabet and for analyzing datasets with binding_affinity scores throughout this work we assume that transcription_factor specificities are well described by product distributions i e pwms and leave for future work the spectral inference of more advanced motif representations finally a comment on the claimed optimality of fastmotif it has been shown see for example that in the limit of infinitely many data and under no model_misspecification a spectral method is statistically consistent that is it always recovers the true underlying model fastmotif being a spectral method inherits this optimality property by the way of the uniqueness of matrix eigen decomposition this is in marked contrast to algorithms like expectation_maximization em that can easily get trapped in poor local_optima even under favourable sample conditions in practice we expect the output of fastmotif to approach optimality when the true binding model approaches a pwm and the size of the training_dataset is big enough as for example in the case of ht selex data the article is organized as follows in section we give a brief overview of related work in section we describe fastmotif and its application to sequencing_data and in section we show our results more mathematical details about spectral approaches in general and fastmotif in particular can be found in the supplementary_material the matlab_code of fastmotif is available from http lcsb portal uni lu bioinformatics the present version of fastmotif has been optimized to process datasets from ht selex experiments on transcription_factor binding due to the enormous_number of sequences ht selex data are hard to analyse using other available motif_discovery designed to fill this gap fastmotif is able to process ht selex datasets in few seconds and extract high_quality probabilistic binding models that match those produced by other state of the art algorithms in this section we present and discuss the performance of the algorithm on various ht selex datasets and compare the motifs produced by fastmotif with the ones produced by other algorithms to test the robustness of fastmotif to model_misspecification we have also tested fastmotif on semi_synthetic data with increasing amounts of noise finally we report some important theoretical features of the algorithm and discuss its sensitivity with respect to some user_defined parameters that can be tuned to optimize the search
