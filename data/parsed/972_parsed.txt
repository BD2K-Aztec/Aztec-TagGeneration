chromothripsisdb a curated database of chromothripsis chromothripsis is a single catastrophic_event that can lead to massive genomic_rearrangements confined to one or a few chromosomes it provides an alternative paradigm in cancer development and changes the conventional view that cancer develops in a stepwise progression the mechanisms_underlying chromothripsis and their specific impact on tumorigenesis are still poorly_understood and further examination of a large number of identified chromothripsis samples is needed unfortunately this data are difficult to access as they are scattered across multiple publications come in different formats and descriptions or are hidden in figures and supplementary_materials to improve access to this data and promote meta_analysis we developed chromothripsisdb a manually_curated database containing a unified description of all published chromothripsis cases and relevant genomic_aberrations currently chromothripsis samples_representing research_articles are included in our database chromothripsisdb represents an extraordinary resource for mining the existing knowledge of chromothripsis and will facilitate the identification of mechanisms_involved in this phenomenon availability_and chromothripsisdb is freely_available atchromothripsis is a single catastrophic_event of massive chromosomal_rearrangements that has been described in a wide_variety especially in cancer in contrast to the widely_accepted model of gradual accumulation of genetic_alterations during cancer development chromothripsis is supposed to be a newly_discovered paradigm in tumorigenesis in brief one or several chromosomes are shattered into many different sized fragments through a catastrophic_event some of the fragments are then randomly stitched back together to generate a derivative chromosome and the others are lost this process may generate dna amplifications deletions and chromosomal fusion_events that underpin chromosome evolution chromothripsis has received a growing amount of attention in recent_years since it may reveal a new way that cancer_genomes can evolve however the mechanisms leading to this event are not yet fully characterized a meta_analysis based on a large number of chromothripsis samples is needed to uncover more about the phenomenon which would substantially enhance our understanding of tumor_initiation unfortunately due to the overall low incidence of chromothripsis occurs in only of all cancers most studies reported a relatively small number of chromothripsis cases moreover the relevant data_acquisition is a cumbersome process since they are scattered in different parts of various publications and are heterogeneous in their contents and formats to address this problem we created chromothripsisdb which is a manually_curated database that catalogs all published chromothripsis v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com articles and samples in the current release chromothripsisdb includes data and results from publications covering cases dna_copy cnas structural_variations svs and clinical data were curated and normalized into standardized formats to the best of the authors knowledge chromothripsisdb is the first database dedicated to processing and visualizing chromothripsis data it can facilitate future_research to identify key features of this event and elucidate the underlying_molecular chromothripsisdb contains data from all published_studies that screening for chromothripsis events supplementary currently it includes cases manually_curated from research_articles on two species human and mouse these data represent disease types of which are cancers besides malignant_tumors congenital_abnormalities also account for a notable proportion of the database supplementary the cna profiles and svs of chromothripsis cases were identified by next_generation array_comparative or single_nucleotide chromothripsisdb is the first repository providing convenient public access to chromothripsis data we curated and integrated hundreds of chromothripsis samples from the published_literature into the database we will continue to update our database every months with newly published_data it represents an invaluable resource for the community and will assist in the meta_analysis of chromothripsis phenomenon
