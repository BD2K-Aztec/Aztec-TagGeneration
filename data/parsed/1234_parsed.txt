cytomodeler a tool for bridging large_scale network_analysis and dynamic quantitative modeling cytomodeler is an open_source java_application based on the cytoscape platform it integrates large_scale network_analysis and quantitative modeling by combining omics analysis on the cytoscape platform access to deterministic and stochastic simulators and static and dynamic_network context visualizations of simulation_results availability implemented_in cytomodeler runs with cytoscape and binaries documentation and video walkthroughs are freely_available vrac iastate edu jlv cytomodeler large_scale network_analysis and quantitative modeling have emerged as key methods for interpreting biological_datasets largescale network_analysis uses networks to model large_scale omics_data produced by high_throughput where nodes represent biological species and edges between nodes stand for interactions between the species quantitative mathematical_modeling of biological_systems has a much longer history than large_scale network_analysis in this method researchers build mathematical equations for biological_systems and simulate predict and test behaviors of the systems in silico significant progress has been made in the development of software that focuses on large_scale network and quantitative modeling over the past_years such as cytoscape a popular open_source platform for large_scale network_visualization and for viewing and editing data along with a highly_flexible and extensible plug in mechanism systems_biology toolbox sbt and systems_biology workbench sbw for quantitative modeling while the number of active software_tools which implement these two types of methods singly is growing fast linkages between them are missing knowledge inferred from large_scale network_analysis can be quantitatively modeled for examining the dynamics of smaller subsystems with respect to various physiological_conditions or time to whom correspondence should be addressed courses cytomodeler is a software_tool dedicated to bridging largescale network_analysis and quantitative modeling by providing the following features i access to a wide_range of functionality for large_scale network_analysis by being a plug in tool on cytoscape platform ii a built in compact quantitative model editor which enables model creating importing and exporting with several formats including sbml levels and iii a model exchanger which allows users to transfer modeling information between cytoscape and quantitative modeling tools such as the sbt on matlab and sbw and iv advanced visualization for quantitative simulation_results in a network context this functionality enables biologists to integrate large_scale network_analysis and quantitative modeling into an analytical workflow of systems_biology
