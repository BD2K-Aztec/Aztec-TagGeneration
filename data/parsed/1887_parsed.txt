structural_bioinformatics frodock fast protein protein_docking server the prediction of proteinprotein_complexes from the structures of unbound components is a challenging and powerful strategy to decipher the mechanism of many essential_biological we present a user_friendly proteinprotein_docking server based on an improved version of frodock that includes a complementary knowledge based potential the web_interface provides a very effective tool to explore and select proteinprotein models and interactively screen them against experimental distance constraints the competitive success_rates and efficiency achieved allow the retrieval of reliable potential proteinprotein binding conformations that can be further refined with more computationally_demanding strategies availability_and the server is free and open to all users with no login requirement at http proteinprotein_interactions are involved in every cellular_process and their characterization is therefore critical to understanding the underlying_molecular the computational_prediction of proteinprotein_complexes from the unbound d structures is a successful complementary alternative to ongoing structural and proteomic endeavors a great variety of computational ab_initio docking approaches have been developed to predict protein_complexes these algorithms employ a variety of efficient search_strategies and energy based_scoring strategies usually beginning with an exhaustive six dimensional search to generate many potential predictions followed by a detailed and more computationally_demanding refining stage however despite the significant progress in improved scoring_functions and the integrative use of biochemical and biophysical information current_algorithms are still limited in a recent independent comprehensive assessment of current exhaustive docking programs the best three docking approaches succeed in identifying acceptable proteinprotein solutions in and of the cases within the top components in only a few minutes the user_friendly interface permits the interactive_exploration of the docking models including additional screening filters with experimental distance constraints to enhance the success of identifying near native docking solutions
