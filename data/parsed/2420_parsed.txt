sequence_analysis indel and carryforward correction icc a new analysis approach for processing pyrosequencing_data motivation pyrosequencing technology provides an important new approach to more extensively characterize diverse sequence populations and detect low_frequency variants however the promise of this technology has been difficult to realize as careful correction of sequencing_errors is crucial to distinguish rare_variants in an infected_host with high_sensitivity results we developed a new approach referred to as indel and carryforward correction icc to cluster sequences without substitutions and locally correct only indel and carryforward sequencing_errors within clusters to ensure that no rare_variants are lost icc performs sequence_clustering in the order of i homopolymer indel patterns only ii indel patterns only and iii carryforward errors only without the requirement of a distance cutoff value overall icc removed of sequencing_errors found in control datasets on pyrose quencing data from a pcr fragment derived from hiv plasmid clones mixed at various frequencies as low as icc achieved the highest sensitivity and similar specificity compared with other commonly used error_correction and variant_calling availability_and source_code is freely_available for download at http indra mullins microbiol washington edu icc it is implemented in perl and supported on linux mac os x and ms windows massively_parallel mps technologies such as pyrosequencing are becoming common to rapidly and cost effectively detect and quantitate rare sequence_variants pyrosequencing generates up to millions of reads that can include rare_variants to detect low_frequency drug_resistance and immune_escape variants in viral human immunodeficiency virusand simian_immunodeficiency populations however the pcr required before pyrosequencing of hiv siv populations introduces misincorporation errors and the pyrosequencing process introduces a significant number of indels and carryforward errors to accurately estimate population_diversity by mps it is crucial to distinguish biological variants from process errors with high_sensitivity previous_studies of pyrosequencing_data have managed to reduce sequence processing errors by improving pcr and sequencing_platforms also several error_correction and variant_calling have been published salmela and schroderschroder used multiple_alignments of reads as well as quality_scores to distinguish correct base calls from erroneous ones and their method is easily adjustable to reads derived from different mps platforms prosperi and salemi developed a program for viral_population reconstruction with a built in poisson error correction_method and post reconstruction probabilistic clustering introduced vphaser a single_nucleotide calling tool that uses phase and quality filtering with a probability model that incorporates and recalibrates individual base quality_scores to increase both sensitivity_and sequence_clustering is also a common way to reduce sequencing_errors one approach is to cluster sequences using genetic_distances another approach is based on flowgrams rather than sequences which allows pyrosequencing errors to be modeled naturally as performed by and both approaches require a distance cutoff value that combines substitutions insertions_and in a single distance measure the cluster centers are haplotypes and the cluster sizes are interpreted as the haplotype frequency in the population error_correction in a cluster is performed by collapsing variation within the cluster therefore there is a risk for loss of real variants in a population if an inappropriate cutoff value is set especially in a population of low_genetic to address the challenge of detecting genetic_variants especially those occurring at low frequencies we developed a new approach that clusters sequences without substitutions and locally corrects only indel and carryforward errors within clusters to whom correspondence should be addressed to ensure that no rare_variants are lost indel and carryforward correction icc provides a complete suite for users to analyze pyrosequencing_data including read quality filtering and alignment indel and carryforward error_correction variant_calling and calculation of single_nucleotide and haplotype_frequencies to determine the efficiency of icc in correcting errors we calculated and compared error_rates before and after icc correction on datasets derived from previously_sequenced plasmid_dnas using pyrosequencing_data of pcr fragments derived from a mixture of hiv plasmid clones at various frequencies we used icc to estimate sensitivity_and and compared these results with several other commonly used error_correction and variant_calling
