transcription_factors tfs regulate the expression of their target_genes through interactions with specific dna_binding in the genome data on tf dna_binding specifici ties are essential for understanding how regulatory specificity is achieved results numerous studies have used universal protein binding microarray pbm technology to determine the in vitro binding specifi cities of hundreds of tfs for all possible bp sequences mers we have developed a bayesian analysis_of anova model that decomposes these mer data into background_noise tf family wise effects and effects due to the particular tf adjusting for background_noise improves pbm data_quality and concordance with in vivo tf_binding data moreover our model provides simultaneous identification of tf subclasses and their shared sequence preferences and also of mers bound preferentially by individual members of tf sub classes such results may aid in deciphering cis_regulatory codes and determinants of proteindna binding_specificity availability_and source_code compiled code and r and python scripts are available from http thebrain bwh harvard edu hierarchicalanova contact transcription_factors tfs play_a in the regulation of gene_expression by activating or repressing transcription of their target_genes regulatory specificity is achieved primarily by the recognition of specific dna_binding in the genome by sequence specific tfs data on tf dna binding_specificity are important for understanding how transcriptional_regulation is encoded in cis regulatory_sequences in the genome tfs can be classified according to the structural_class of their dna_binding tfs of the same structural_class adopt the same fold in their dna_binding and dock with their dna_binding in a similar manner because of these structural_similarities combined with sequence_similarities because of the origin of tf families from ancient gene_duplications and subsequent mutations members of the same dbd class often but not always have similar dnabinding sequence preferences a dbd class can be further divided_into subclasses with more closely_related exhibiting more similar dna binding_preferences understanding how highly_similar members of a tf family attain both redundant and divergent regulatory_functions remains_a accurate and comprehensive data on dna_binding sequence specificities are essential for investigations of regulatory targeting by tfs including the identification of the molecular_determinants of tf dna binding_specificity a variety of high_throughput have been developed for determining tf dna binding_specificity reviewed in methods that provide data on in vivo tf occupancies in the genome such as chromatin_immunoprecipitation coupled with either dna_microarrays chip_chip or high_throughput chipseq provide data on both direct and indirect dna_binding by which can vary across cellular or environmental_conditions in contrast approaches that determine dna binding_specificities in vitro provide data on direct tfdna interactions without the confounding_effects of in vivo protein cofactors protein binding microarray pbm technology is an in vitro approach for characterizing the dna binding_specificities of proteins by assaying the binding of a protein to a library of double_stranded dna_sequences immobilized on a dna_microarray universal pbms contain synthetic dna_sequences designed to represent all possible k_mers with commonly used array designs encompassing all possible bp dna_sequences k universal pbms have been used in numerous recent_studies to determine the dna binding_specificities of hundreds of tfs from a wide_range of organisms with major efforts on tfs encoded in the genomes of the yeast_saccharomyces and mouse universal pbms contain bp dna_probes each of which contains multiple mers embedded within variable flanking_sequence for statistical robustness binding preference scores to whom correspondence should be addressed are calculated for all mers each of which is represented on at least or spots for palindromic and non palindromic mers respectively on the array analysis of universal pbm data using the universal pbm analysis suite including the seed andwobble algorithm which was developed together with the universal pbm technology involves background_subtraction various normalizations of the data and calculation of various binding scores for each mer including the median fluorescence signal_intensity over all probes that contain a particular mer and a rankbased pbm enrichment e score ranging from worst to best the mer data can be used to derive a dnabinding specificity motif or position_weight pwm analyses of large collections of universal pbm data have identified previously_unknown diversity in the dna_binding sequences recognized by tfs hierarchical_clustering of tfs according to their similarity in mer e scores has permitted more precise identification of tf subclasses according to their dna binding_specificities in addition examination of k_mer binding_preferences within a tf family here defined as a group of closely_related tfs belong to the same dbd structural_class or the same subclass within a dbd class has revealed sets of k_mers bound in common across the family tf common k_mers and also sets of k_mers preferred by an individual member s of a tf family to date identification of such tf preferred k_mers has been performed in an ad_hoc fashion in manual investigations of individual sets of tfs that used various semi arbitrary thresholds combined with visual_inspection such tf preferred k_mers may contribute to the distinct regulatory_functions that distinguish members of a tf family although hierarchical_clustering has been used successfully for functional_classification of gene_expression microarray_experiments and for identification of tf subclasses based on pbm experiments the inclusion of unnecessary features that are irrelevant to cluster determination may degrade the results this is especially the case for pbm experiments where only a small fraction of k_mers measured by experiments are bound specifically by the profiled tf biclustering is a simultaneous similarity based clustering approach that is able to detect subsets of features that exhibit consistent_patterns over subsets of experiments however it does not directly provide a systematic classification of tf subclasses model based_methods for identifying and removing batch_effects and other sources of variation have been developed for metaanalysis of high_throughput data including microarray_based gene_expression experiments direct_application of such methods potentially could separate systematic background_noise from identification of k_mers preferred by different tfs from pbm data here we present a bayesian_hierarchical analysis_of anova approach for modeling pbm k_mer data here mers our method identifies mers that score artifactually highly sticky mers for unknown reasons our approach for subsequently adjusting for these systematic_biases improves overall pbm data_quality and improves concordance with chip_chip data our modeling results in systematic identification of tf subclasses simultaneously with their shared dna binding_preferences as well as the sequence preferences that distinguish them our tf subclassification results are consistent with classifications based on tf dbd sequence_similarity our method also permits automated identification of tf preferred k_mers within tf subclasses improved identification of tf preferred k_mers will aid in studies of potential differences in the targeting of different genomic_sites by paralogous tfs and thus potentially how they may exert different regulatory_functions we anticipate that such modeling will aid in identification of genomic cis_regulatory codes i e cis_regulatory sequence_features that confer particular gene_expression and will improve the quality of datasets for identification of the molecular_determinants of tfdna sequence_specificity we have developed a bayesian anova model to decompose mer pbm e scores into background_noise i e artifactually high_scoring background k_mers family wise effects and experiment specific effects given a collection of pbm experiments and tf family classification based on dbd structural_class below we start with the identification of artifactually high_scoring background k_mers then describe the identification of tf subclasses based on the k_mer data and conclude with identification of experiment specific effects in analyses aimed at improved identification of sets of k_mers bound preferentially by one tf as compared with a closely_related tf i e tf preferred k_mers
