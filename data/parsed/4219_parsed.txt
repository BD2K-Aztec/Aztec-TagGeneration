systems_biology shaping the interaction landscape of bioactive_molecules motivation most bioactive_molecules perform their action by interacting with proteins or other macromolecules however for a significant fraction of them the primary target remains_unknown in addition the majority of bioactive_molecules have more than one target many of which are poorly_characterized computational predictions of bio active molecule targets based on similarity with known ligands are powerful to narrow down the number of potential targets and to rationalize side_effects of known molecules results using a reference_set of molecules active on human proteins we show that accurate target prediction can be achieved by combining different measures of chemical similarity based on both chemical_structure and molecular_shape our results indicate that the combined approach is especially efficient when no ligand with the same scaffold or from the same chemical series has yet been discovered we also observe that different combinations of similarity_measures are optimal for different molecular_properties such as the number of heavy_atoms this further highlights the importance of considering different classes of similarity_measures between new molecules and known ligands to accurately_predict their targets a large number of small_molecules ranging from metabolites to signaling_molecules to drugs display strong bioactivity in different living_systems this activity is often mediated by physical_interactions with proteins or other macromolecules therefore information about the targets of bioactive_molecules is crucial to understand predict and interfere with their activity in particular it can be used i to predict unfavorable side_effects due to off target interactions and thus potentially decrease the attrition_rate in clinical_trials due to toxicity or ii to predict a new target for an approved drug and reposition it for another disease experimental identification of bioactive molecule targets has received much attention this has led to technological_developments of large facilities enabling researchers to screen a given molecule against arrays of targets such as kinases chemogenomic strategies have also been introduced to identify the targets of bioactive_molecules in model_organisms such as yeast or bacteria several databases have been developed by various groups to provide access to these data such as chembl drugbank pubchem or zinc these databases contain unprecedentedly large_datasets of interactions between proteins and small_molecules for instance only for human protein ligands the chembl database contains close to reported direct_interactions i e annotated as binding with activity mm involving small_molecules however a significant fraction of bioactive_molecules still do not have any known target this is especially true for compounds_tested uniquely in functional_assays for instance of the compounds in chembl with reported functional activity in human cells do not have direct target information see methods section moreover even for well studied molecules our knowledge of their targets is far from complete for instance n n dimethyltryptamine was initially described as a ligand of sigma_receptor later on it was shown to also bind hydroxytryptamine receptors more generally one can expect that even a significant fraction of food_and fda_approved have at least some unknown target computational predictions of bioactive molecule targets are helpful to narrow down the set of potential targets to be tested and to predict off target effects of known molecules or drugs a widely used strategy consists in identifying proteins with known ligands similar to a query molecule i e the so_called ligand based_approach standard_approaches use similarity_measures between molecules based on chemical fingerprints historically fingerprint similarity_measures have been developed to classify molecules into families thus they are powerful to identify molecules derived from the same chemical series more recently other measures of similarity have been introduced for instance it is known that the d shape of molecules plays an important role when binding to a target therefore the ligands of a protein often display similarity in their shape this similarity can be quantified by methods based on structural_alignment or shape recognition to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com such as ultrafast shape recognition the latter technique was recently expanded to consider partial charges distribution and atomic lipophilicity a very attractive feature of shape comparison is the ability to detect similarities between molecules with different chemical_structures a property often referred to as scaffold_hopping despite this advantage previous_studies suggest that fingerprint similarity gives higher performance both in virtual_screening and in target predictions yet it is unclear whether this is due to limitations of shape comparison e g limited conformational_sampling shortcomings of shape descriptors or to biases in benchmarking datasets e g overrepresentation of ligands from the same chemical series other approaches to predict targets of bioactive_molecules have been proposed based on higher_level features such as side_effects transcriptional_responses and text_mining although these approaches are powerful to identify similarities between molecules without chemical similarity they require additional experimental_data and therefore are limited to molecules for which such data are available for proteins with known structures binding_site similarity can be used to identify proteins that could accommodate similar ligands moreover in this case docking algorithms can help predict whether a molecule can bind to a target here we develop an original method of bioactive molecule target predictions that combines chemical and shape similarity see we perform extensive validation of the method and show that combining these two similarity_measures leads to improved_performance this is especially true when predicting the targets of a molecule in the absence of other ligands originating from the same chemical series thus our results suggest that the lower performance of shape similarity_measures that was previously_reported is at least partly due to biases in available benchmarks nevertheless fingerprintbased methods still perform well even after stringent removal of all molecules that are trivially similar e g with the same scaffold we also observe that different combinations of similarity_measures are optimal for different molecular_properties identifying proteins with ligands similar to bioactive_molecules is a strong indication of possible direct_interactions that could predict or explain observed bioactivity here we use the chembl database to collect known ligands of human proteins and we explore different similarity_measures based on chemical_structure fingerprints and molecular_shape electroshape as well as combinations of these see methods target prediction is carried_out following the workflow of a query molecule is compared with all other molecules in chembl to assign a score to each target corresponding to the similarity value with the most similar ligand when combining different measures of similarity we use logistic_regressions to combine the similarity values obtained with each similarity measure see methods to illustrate the different strategies investigated in this work in we show examples of ligands whose target is best predicted by shape similarity fingerprint similarity as well as combination of both and d in the query molecule chembl has only one reported target cdk ic mm and no other ligand of this protein is a simple analog of this molecule therefore predictions based on fingerprint similarity rank this target at position among all possible targets shape similarity instead identifies a ligand of cdk that displays similar overall shape and partial charges distribution and based on the similarity with this molecule cdk is ranked at the fifth position among all targets shows a frequently_encountered case in which a clear analog chembl of the query molecule is present among the ligands of its target in this case fingerprint similarity is more appropriate in particular the missing hydroxyl_groups in the most similar ligand detected by the fingerprint similarity chembl result in lower shape similarity that prevents accurate_predictions this example highlights some of the possible weaknesses of shape comparison and already suggests that combining different similarity_measures is useful to optimally harness the information present among the ligands of a target as examples of the combined strategy we show inand d typical cases where combining the two kinds of similarity results in better predictions here both shape and fingerprint similarity values give reasonable predictions with the cognate target being ranked between the th and th position however combining the two kinds of similarities results in significantly better performance indicating how the presence of different ligands similar to the query molecule according to both similarity_measures gives even higher confidence in the predictions more generally first row shows the average crossvalidation auc values over all tested ligands we can observe that fingerprint similarity performs better than shape similarity and the combined approach leads to the highest auc although all three approaches give very high auc values however as discussed in the next section these high auc values mainly result from the habitual design of chemically related_molecules to target the same protein in particular cases of close analogs among the ligands of a target see example in appear very often in chembl
