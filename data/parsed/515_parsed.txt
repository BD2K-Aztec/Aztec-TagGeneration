assembly based_inference of b cell receptor reper toires from short_read rna sequencing_data with v'djer motivation b cell receptor repertoire profiling is an important tool for understanding the biology of diverse immunologic processes current methods for analyzing adaptive immune receptor repertoires depend upon pcr_amplification of vdj rearrangements followed by long_read amplicon se quencing spanning the vdj junctions while this approach has proven to be effective it is frequently not feasible due to cost or limited sample material additionally there are many existing datasets where short_read rna sequencing_data are available but pcr_amplified bcr data are not results we present here vdjer an assembly based method that reconstructs adaptive immune receptor repertoires from short_read rna sequencing_data this method captures expressed b cell receptor loci from a standard rna_seq assay we applied this method to melanoma samples from the cancer_genome and demonstrate vdjers ability to accurately_reconstruct b cell receptor repertoires from short_read mrna_seq t cells and b cells compose the adaptive_immune and bear highly_specific cell_surface that allow them to recognize antigenic targets massive diversity at the adaptive immune receptor loci is generated by the process of v j and v d j recombination during cell development with a theoretical number of unique receptors for each class estimated at greater than and lower bounds for circulating_lymphocytes measured at greater than this extraordinary diversity is achieved through recombination of v d and j segments insertions_and at junction points as well as somatic_hypermutation in the case of b cell receptors bcr supplemental this diversity of targeting receptors is crucial for immune_defense against infectious pathogens and has implications for understanding autoimmunity immunodeficiency syndromes and the anti tumor immune_response to malignant_diseases adaptive immune receptor repertoire analysis was initially performed by evaluating differences in sequence_length of the primary antigen binding region a process known as spectratyping the author s published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work we present here the vdjer software for inference of b cell receptor repertoires using short_read rna sequencing_data a major advantage of this approach is the capacity to capture expressed b cell receptor loci in a standard rna_seq assay this is especially important in application to clinical samples where nucleic_acid template may be limiting in contrast to assays that depend on pcr_amplification vdjer is not limited to evaluating only those sequences that can be successfully primed vdjer does not require facs sorting of b cells prior to analysis rather it performs well when analyzing complex rna template mixtures derived from the bulk tumor immune microenvironment application of vdjer is primarily limited by read_coverage of the clones of interest in the setting of high coverage assembly sensitivity_and are high as well however in areas of low coverage sensitivity lessens thus in the context of a tumor immune infiltrate vdjer is best suited for reconstruction of dominant and subdominant clones the algorithm allows for wide latitude in choosing parameters for optimal_performance given the expected coverage in the sample however there is a lower_bound on coverage for recovering a given clonotype in the assembly functional b cell receptors are protein multimers comprising heavy_chain and kappa or lambda_light pairing recently multiple methods have been developed to capture paired heavy light_chain information or paired alpha_beta chains in the context of t cell receptor repertoires vdjer does not attempt this pairing other assembly based_methods have been used to analyze adaptive immune receptor repertoires the first of these was issake developed which assembled short_read mrna_seq derived from sequencing race products to reconstruct tcr repertoires this method has not to our knowledge been applied to b cell receptor loci a second method used the trinity assembly algorithm to reconstruct dominant igh sequences and analyze somatic_hypermutation of their variable_regions in chronic_lymphocytic samples vdjer showed superior_performance to this method in the context of bulk rna_seq including reads from a diverse underlying bcr repertoire additionally other tools have been developed to perform a selective local_assembly based upon k_mer or read extraction for example a method used for crispr detection in bacteria and archaea identifies and clusters frequently occurring k_mers for assembly ben adaptive immune receptor repertoire profiling in general is an important analytical tool for translational cancer_biology our group and others have shown that b cell_lineage gene_expression are strongly prognostic in multiple solid tumor_types b cell receptor variable region mutation_rate is prognostic in chronic_lymphocytic and adaptive immune receptor repertoire profiling provides the most sensitive method of detecting minimal_residual in b cell leukemias applied to a large melanoma mrna seq dataset vdjer allowed discovery of prognostic_information in tumor_infiltrating bcr repertoire diversity over and above bcr expression alone given the huge clinical interest in this immunotherapy approach and limited material of many pre_treatment tumor biopsy_samples vdjer will be critical for adaptive immune receptor analysis for understanding response to immunotherapy and developing biomarkers to guide_treatment
