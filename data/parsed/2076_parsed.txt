glycananalysis plug in a database_search tool for n glycan_structures using mass_spectrometry tandem_mass ms_ms or ms n is a potent technique for characterizing n glycan_structures glycananalysis searches a glycan database to support the identification of glycan_structures from ms_ms it also calculates diagnostic ions of glycan_structures registered in a glycan database glycomedb or kegg glycan and searches for ms_ms of n glycans that match diagnostic ions to determine the structures this program functions as a plug in for mass a freeware mass_spectrum visualization and analysis program availability_and the executable files of mass are available for free at http www first ms d jp english the glycananalysis plug in is included in the standard package of mass for windows contactn glycosylation is an important post_translational of proteins and has a wide_variety of biological_roles n glycans form branching tree structures consisting of two main antennae antenna and antenna since these structures are assumed to be related to their biological_functions it is important to characterize the glycan_structures mass_spectrometry ms is a powerful technique for analyzing n glycans the structures can be deduced using tandem_ms ms_ms typical n glycan analysis using ms is performed in positiveion mode in contrast harveys method can be adopted in negativeion mode which has proven useful for less ambiguous structural clarification harvey a b c harvey described the methodology to identify the glycan_structure uniquely with the observed structure specific diagnostic ions which are included in only negative ion ms_ms although various excellent computer programs e g have been developed for interpreting ms_ms of n glycans they do not consider highly_specific features of negative_ion analysis e g diagnostic ions see_supplementary for details recently we developed more sensitive methods for analyzing n glycan_structures in negative_ion using matrix_assisted ms with unique chemical labeling b we thus developed glycananalysis software to provide support to routine processes in manual interpretation of mass_spectrometric for n glycan_structures using diagnostic ions searching against the public glycan structural database for this software we developed an algorithm to calculate m z values of fragment_ions including diagnostic ions and to search for structures matching ms_ms in glycan structural databases glycananalysis is available as a free plug in of mass pluggable freeware for analyzing and visualizing ms data
