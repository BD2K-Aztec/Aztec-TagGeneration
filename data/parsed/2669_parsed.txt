large_scale exploration and analysis of drug_combinations motivation drug_combinations are a promising strategy for combating complex_diseases by improving the efficacy and reducing corresponding side_effects currently a widely_studied problem in pharmacology is to predict effective drug_combinations either through empirically screening in clinic or pure experimental_trials however the large_scale prediction of drug_combination by a systems method is rarely considered results we report a systems pharmacology framework to predict drug_combinations predcs on a computational_model termed probability ensemble approach pea for analysis of both the efficacy and adverse_effects of drug_combinations first a bayesian_network integrating with a similarity algorithm is developed to model the combinations from drug molecular and pharmacological phenotypes and the predictions are then assessed with both clinical_efficacy and adverse_effects it is illustrated that pea can predict the combination efficacy of drugs spanning different therapeutic_classes with high_specificity auc which was further validated by independent data or new experimental assays pea also evaluates the adverse_effects auc quantitatively and detects the therapeutic_indications for drug_combinations finally the predc database includes known and predicted optimal combinations as well as their potential side_effects and therapeutic_indications availability_and the predc database is available atdrug combination_therapies have been used for the treatment of complex_diseases such as cancer and infection for over years due to the advantage of higher efficacy fewer side_effects and less toxicity compared with single drug treatment the main_reason is that complex_diseases normally involve physiological_processes controlled in a combinatorial systems fashion featured asredundancy and multifunctionality which limits the therapeutic opportunity of one gene one drug applications despite the increasing number of drug_combinations in use many of them were found in clinic by experience or experimentally_derived by doseresponse curves for each pair of drugs against a protein target the mechanistic_understanding of synergistic drug pairs remains_largely which makes_it to propose new drug_combinations systematic surveys of combination drugs in vitro have been proposed to investigate the synergistic drug pairs such as the highthroughput screening method and the multiplex screening for interacting compounds however the large_scale experiments currently used to evaluate the drug_combinations are very time consuming simply because they are severely dependent on the searches of a vast space of possible target combinations alternatively some computational_approaches have been proposed which aimed at using network_analysis and chemical_biology data to identify novel combinatorial drugs but most of them are often limited in their capability to dissect the underlying_molecular or to extract the information from a larger pharmacological space or to associate the targets with multiple_diseases for combinatorial drugs generally simultaneous administration of two or more medications may result in significant drugdrug_interactions ddis leading to a high_risk of adverse_effects for patients ddis may be pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic previous work concerns the prediction of ddis mainly relying on the pharmacokinetic_properties of the compound such as its solubility or depending on pharmacodynamic constants or handling both pharmacokinetic_and ddis however an up to date combined analysis integrating both the efficacy and adverse_effects for known or novel drug pairs which may provide the basis for future_clinical is still lacking recently we have developed a set of systems pharmacology strategies for systematic pursuit of optimal drug_combinations these works lay foundations for a more comprehensive understanding of pharmacological synergy in herbal_medicine and the combination rule of traditional_chinese furthermore a large_scale systematic analysis combining pharmacokinetics chemogenomics pharmacology and systems_biology data was performed through computational_methods and experimental_validation which results in a superior output of information for systematic drug_design strategies for complex_diseases in this work we propose a new systems pharmacology framework consisting of a new algorithm termed probability ensemble approach pea through integrating the molecular chemical_space the pharmacological space the gene_annotations in particular the connectivity of biological_networks to predict effective drug_combinations in contrast to those previous_studies mentioned above the novelty of pea is threefold i to the best of our knowledge pea presents up to now the largest scale unbiased prediction of effective drug_combinations based on a complete set of drug_combination drug disease and drugside effect relations ii pea also provides a quantitative assessment of the therapeutic_indications and side_effects for each combination in clinical_usage iii to show the predictive value of our approach the predictions were benchmarked against independent datasets and further tested using cancer cell and antibacterial models a major_challenge in predicting the drug_combination in a large_scale is to achieve the desired prediction_accuracy while dealing within the drug_class the first letter of each atc category denotes the top level anatomical class the complex conditions of missing_data different data types unclear mechanisms etc one means to achieve this is to exploit a large database with sufficient information for drug_combinations and a method that distinguishes the therapeutic_efficacy from adverse_effects that may make it feasible to more precisely select the optimal combinations the incompleteness of target network information and the scarceness of the side effect features hinder the application of computational_approaches to drug_combinations compared with the present available models the pea algorithm shows several major_advantages such as high training efficiency and extensive applicability more particularly pea provides two quantitative indexes to describe the property of a drug_combination which is convenient and easy to understand pea is specifically_designed to accommodate those missing_data and differing types of variables and handle unbalanced multiclass datasets by integrating the weakly predictive features such as target_sequence chemical_structure etc pea exhibits_similar performances as the whole feature model the major reason is due to that bayes algorithm extracts the underlying pattern of features by converting features to a common probabilistic_framework so as to improve the performance of the ensemble based_scoring approach in detail bayesian_network algorithm transforms the features to a lr which provides probabilistic scoring for drug_combinations in an ensemble the ensemble score is further converted to a p value based on a random raw score distribution to calculate the reliability for a predicted drug pair in contrast to conventional method where an optimal_combination is often determined by comparing the similarity with a single known reference the ensemble approach compares a probability_distribution of a query drug pair with all related combinations resulting in the improvement of generalization ability of the pea tool however the simple feature enrich method as well as the one nearest_neighbor may not be capable of dealing with this complex system due to the unadaptability and information_loss in addition it should be noted that we just calculated the protein global similarity instead of the drug binding regions our considerations are i sequence similar proteins might have similar functions since they might be homologs however similar drug binding regions may not reveal whether the two proteins are functionally_similar ii the analyses of drug binding regions are normally dependent of the crystal_structures which severely_limits the algorithms for more general applications and more importantly even we have obtained the structures we still need to define which amino_acids are involved in drug binding since different drugs might bind to different amino_acids in most cases even in the same pocket for the same protein the present computational solution considers drug_actions and their clinical effects in the context of molecular_network systems which provides information for further understanding of the molecular_mechanism and pharmacological_effect underlying drug_combinations generally due to the unclearness of the molecular_mechanisms combination_therapies most drug_combinations are inferred based on sets of clinical rules derived from clinical_experience or randomized_clinical for example combination_therapy for hypertension has been assigned some preferred combinations from various classes of antihypertensive_medications such as renin_angiotensin raas inhibitor diuretic raas inhibitor calcium_channel ccb and ccb diuretics although these conventional rules facilitate searching for valid combinations they limit this search into drug entities with similar functions that is drugs in combinations often have the same first level of the atc_code this is confirmed by the fact that majority of known drug_combinations in our dataset belong to the same therapeutic category from the first to fifth level of the atc_code supplementary to analyze whether pea could overcome_this we have counted the predicted edcs in the database that are composed by drugs with different atc classes the first level extremely interesting we found of our high_confidence predictions with p and p are such kind of combinations indicating that our model is not restrained by the functional_similarity between two drugs for a combination the benchmark_dataset also shows that such combinations have been proved to be effective moreover we have experimentally_validated novel edcs that are combined by antibacterial and anticancer_drugs supplementary tables s s the results show that pairs are synergistic to cancer models for example the antibacterial agent tetracycline as a bacterial s ribosomal subunit inhibitor displays synergistic cytotoxicity against a cells when being combined with some anticancer_drugs such as the dna_synthesis inhibitor fludarabine ci cross_linking reagent cisplatin ci and protein_kinase imatinib ci it is worth noting that the wet experiment could only found synergistic pairs in antifungal test which partially proves that the pea algorithm carries out high_efficiency prediction in practice various approaches have been suggested to benefit risk_assessment during the development of new medicines but little has been reported of being applied on the combinational drugs though they have attracted more and more interests from researchers and industry in recent_years drug_combinations may overcome the side_effects by countering network robustness and bypass compensation and thereby increasing the clinical_efficacy while minimizing the overlapping toxicity and allowing reduced dosage of each compound the efficacy and side effect are normally coupled together and the best end results actually depend on the side_effects contributing to the overall therapeutic_benefit thus the decision to take a drug_combination depends upon the benefit risk weighting of all the potential risks and benefits which up to date are still extremely_difficult to predict on a global scale the complex ddis in multiple_dimensions pose modeling challenges to classical linear approaches as well as hinder the targeted experimental_approaches due to a combinatorial explosion both in the pharmacological and molecular spaces in an effective combinatorial setting the pea algorithm has incorporated the clinical_efficacy and adverse_effect evaluation into the current model resulting in two standards i e p and p the combined evaluation for a predicted combination opens_new of drug_combination and even guides the drug_dosage for example the fludarabine tetracycline combination with high p and low p shows a significant synergistic_effect ci on a cells by lowering the dosage of fludarabine from lm to lm at the cytotoxicity level tetracycline also reduces the risk of opportunistic_infections induced by fludarabine more importantly those combinations with low p and high p predicted by pea should be very carefully applied in practice due to their uncertain influence on the efficacy and safety of drug co administration for example the monoamine_oxidase mao inhibitor tranylcypromine may increase the vasopressor effect of the alpha_agonist midodrine whose p and p are and respectively thus concomitant use of these two drugs should be avoided one limitation for this work is that the dosage is not taken into account in the model till now two methods are in common use for calculating the expected dose_response for drug_combination as compared to mono therapy loewe additivity and bliss independence they both need experiments to characterize drug_combinations therefore following in silico studies should focus not only strategies for predicting drug_combinations but also improving the efficiency of trials
