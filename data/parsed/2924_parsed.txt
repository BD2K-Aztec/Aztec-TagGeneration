data_and metavir a web_server dedicated to virome analysis metavir is a web_server dedicated to the analysis of viral metagenomes viromes in addition to classical approaches for analyzing metagenomes general sequence characteristics taxonomic_composition new tools developed specifically for viral sequence_analysis make it possible to i explore viral diversity through automatically constructed phylogenies for selected marker_genes ii estimate gene richness through rarefaction curves and iii perform cross comparison against other viromes using sequence_similarities metavir is thus unique as a platform that allows a comprehensive virome analysis availability metavir is freely_available online at describing environmental viral communities is a major_challenge for environmental microbiology viruses are known to intervene in a broad_spectrum of processes spanning population regulation horizontal_gene and major biogeochemical cycles however the study of environmental viral communities is made difficult by the fact that only a tiny fraction of their hosts has been cultivated moreover as no single gene is common to all viral_genomes environmental viral communities cannot be studied via approaches based on ribosomal rna_sequencing one way around these limitations is to directly sequence the viral communities such metagenomic approaches can provide insights into the viral diversity of environments of interests and are progressively gaining wider uses existing bioinformatics_tools implemented on web_servers dedicated to metagenome analyses are not specific to particular biological_entities yet viral metagenomes viromes are by nature significantly different from bacterial metagenomes indeed very little is known about viral communities and the strong sequence_divergence and broad gene richness found in viromes indicate a tremendous genetic_diversity yet this diversity remains to whom correspondence should be addressed very poorly_characterized as the databases lack annotated viral_sequences most virome sequences i e reads therefore differ from previously described sequences however direct comparisons of virome sequences from disparate locations often exhibit significant_overlap indicating that although our knowledge on viral_genes remains sparse the same genes are seen everywhere the unknown fraction of the reads between and usually left aside in classical metagenomic analyses represents extremely_valuable data for virome analysis furthermore different marker_genes describing the different viral families are needed to further describe viral diversity and none of these markers are available on existing generalist web_servers to our knowledge phaccs phage communities from contig spectrum is the only tool designed for viral community sequencing but it focuses on assessing the structure of uncultured viral communities in terms of ecological parameters here we present metavir an interactive web_server that performs a comprehensive analysis of viromes classical analyses are available sequence characteristics taxonomic_composition marker_genes selected for each major viral families can be used in a custom_designed procedure to perform phylogenetic_analysis on virome reads the automatically generated phylogenetic_trees allow biologists to explore the viral diversity in a deep and precise manner finally specific tools have been developed to efficiently deal with the vast unknown fraction the gene richness of a virome can be assessed and compared to other viromes and viromes can also be compared in terms of sequence_similarity
