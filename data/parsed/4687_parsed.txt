databases_and tools mirs one place to gather all the tools for mirna analysis mirnas are short non coding molecules that negatively_regulate and thereby play several important roles in living_organisms dozens of computational_methods for mirna related research have been developed which greatly differ in various aspects the substantial availability of difficult to compare approaches makes it challenging for the user to select a proper tool and prompts the need for a solution that will collect and categorize all the methods here we present tools mirs the first platform that gathers currently more than methods for broadly_defined mirna analysis the collected tools are classified into several general and more detailed categories in which the users can additionally filter the available methods according to their specific research needs capabilities and preferences tools mirs is also a web_based target prediction meta server that incorporates user designated target prediction_methods into the analysis of user provided data micrornas mirnas are a class of short nt non coding and single_stranded rnas that mediate the post_transcriptional gene_expression regulation by promoting the cleavage or inhibiting the translation of the target_mrna throughout their mechanism mirnas control the cell development apoptosis proliferation differentiation and several other essential functions in living_organisms to address this need tools mirs a user_friendly manually_curated and filterable service that gathers methods for mirna analyses was developed in mirna related research considerable importance is attached to mirna target_identification which reflects the function of the mirna in the cell therefore tools mirs also enables the prediction of mirna_targets using methods previously selected by the user
