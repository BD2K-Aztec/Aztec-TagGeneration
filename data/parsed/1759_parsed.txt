bioinformatics btq tex sequence_analysis fast and snp tolerant detection of complex variants and splicing in short_reads motivation next_generation captures sequence differences in reads relative to a reference_genome or transcriptome including splicing_events and complex variants involving multiple mismatches and long indels we present computational_methods for fast detection of complex variants and splicing in short_reads based on a successively constrained search_process of merging and filtering position lists from a genomic index our methods are implemented in gsnap genomic short_read nucleotide alignment program which can align both single and paired_end as short as nt and of arbitrarily long length it can detect short and long_distance splicing including interchromosomal splicing in individual_reads using probabilistic_models or a database of known splice_sites our program also permits snp tolerant alignment to a reference space of all possible combinations of major and minor alleles and can align_reads from bisulfite treated dna for the study of methylation_state results in comparison testing gsnap has speeds comparable to existing programs especially in reads of nt and is fastest in detecting complex variants with four or more mismatches or insertions of nt and deletions of nt although snp tolerance does not increase alignment yield substantially it affects alignment results in of transcriptional reads typically by revealing alternate genomic mappings for a read simulations of bisulfite_converted show a decrease in identifying genomic positions uniquely in of nt reads and of nt reads availability source_code in c and utility programs in perl are freely_available for download as part of the gmap package atnumerous programs have been developed to date for the alignment of short_reads from next_generation such as illumina solexa hayward ca usa and abi solid foster city ca usa to a reference_genome or transcriptome because of the large_numbers of short_reads that can be produced from a given sample much emphasis has placed on speed accordingly recent to whom correspondence should be addressed programs such as bowtie bwa and soap have shown how suffix_arrays compressed using a burrows_wheeler transform bwt can rapidly map reads that are exact_matches or have a few mismatches or short insertions_or indels relative to the reference in addition to speed it is also important to broaden the range of possible variants that can be detected in reads since interesting biology is likely to be revealed not merely as single_nucleotide snps or mutations from the reference but also as more complex phenomena such as multiple mismatches long indels and combinations_thereof such complex variants represent a substantial source of genetic_diversity for example indels represent of human polymorphisms with of coding indels being longer than nt long indels that affect multiple amino_acids may have significant biological_consequences moreover as reads continue to lengthen from their original nt to their current nt they are more likely to have multiple or complex differences from the reference making detection of complex variants even more critical other important biological_phenomena arise from splicing_events which provide insights into gene structure alternative_splicing gene_fusions and chromosomal_rearrangements although splicing can be determined readily in long est and cdna_sequences using generalpurpose genomic mapping and alignment programs such as blat or gmap short_reads pose a challenge because they often align to numerous places in a genome and because they often lack insufficient sequence_specificity on one or both ends of the exonexon junction to accurately define the junction one solution for detecting splicing in short_reads has been to align them to a reference transcriptome possibly augmented with artificially constructed exonexon segments however such an approach will identify only known or predicted combinations of exons and not unexpected exon pairs that occur through exon_skipping cryptic splicing or gene_fusions another approach taken by the tophat program analyzes an entire dataset of mapped_reads to identify splice_site junctions between exons in a given neighborhood however that approach_requires exons to have sufficiently_high expression and will miss splicing_events that are spanned by individual_reads at a low_level a third approach provided by the qpalma program can align individual_reads across exonexon junctions using smithwaterman type alignments and a specifically trained splice_site model all of these approaches are limited topage
