foglight an efficient matrix based_approach to construct metabolic_pathways by search_space reduction motivation a fundamental computational_problem in the area of metabolic_engineering is finding metabolic_pathways between a pair of source and target metabolites efficiently we present an approach namely foglight for searching metabolic_networks utilizing boolean and or operations represented in matrix notation to efficiently reduce_the this enables the enumeration of all pathways between metabolites that are too distant for the application of brute_force methods results benchmarking tests run with foglight show that it can reduce_the by up to after which the accelerated search for high accurate results is guaranteed using foglight several pathways between eight given pairs of metabolites are found of which the pathways from co to ethanol are specifically discussed additionally in comparison with three path finding tools namely pht fmm and routesearch foglight can find shorter and more pathways for attempted source target_metabolite pairs as time passes on our knowledge of metabolism is being developed and metabolic databases such as kegg metacyc and similar databases are evolving as this information advances however our insight is still incomplete and the gaps are being filled gradually metabolic_engineering emerged in the early s is defined as the directed modulation of metabolic_pathways using methods of recombinant technology for the purpose of over production or accelerated production of fuels chemical and pharmaceutical_products metabolic_pathways are the roadmaps in which a biomolecule namely metabolite undergoes possible biotransformations either under the action of enzymatic_catalysis or by spontaneous reactions the problem of synthesizing these roadmaps is more complex than the one referring to a tree structured search network hypergraphs are better representations for metabolic_networks since finding k shortest hyperpaths of a hypergraph is an npcomplete problem the problem should be solved heuristically research on metabolic_pathways is done in two complementary categories the analysis of metabolic_pathways is motivated by the rapidly increasing quantity of available information on the pathways some researchers try to analyze the pathways with certain properties like elementary_flux and thermodynamic feasibility on the other hand some algorithms have been proposed to find or predict possible pathways in order to convert a given source metabolite to a given target_metabolite some of these algorithms are based on one evolutionary algorithms machine_learning etc some algorithms have been proposed to find or predict possible pathways in order to convert a given source metabolite to a given target_metabolite k ffner and his coauthors in applied an informed searching method which is similar to on petri_nets derived from metabolic databases to find and enumerate all valid pathways satisfying additional user_defined constraints petri_nets directed bipartite graphs and state_transition graphs are the main tools to model metabolic_networks and apply some informed and uninformed approaches to them in addition to these approaches various mathematical_methods have emerged in the postgenomic era to search for metabolic_pathways in the literature the authors detailed optimization models based upon integer_linear ilp to search for plausible metabolic_pathways algorithms incorporating concepts from retrosynthesis have been developed to search in the metabolic space represented by hypergraphs for desired pathways these algorithms borrowed an idea from the allied field of synthetic chemistry in which reversed chemical_transformations are iteratively applied starting from a target product to reach precursors that are endogenous to the chassis in two methods one based on elementary modes and the other based on a direct enumeration algorithm were presented as other approaches using retrosynthesis model novel metabolic routes have been efficiently screened by probabilistic selection of metabolic_pathways in a brute_force method is an exhaustive_search approach which systematically enumerates all possible candidates for the exact solution this is an effective approach in finding pathways but it cannot be used for large_networks as the execution time of the algorithm grows exponentially with the size of the network one approach to ameliorate the exponential time problem of the brute_force search is often to reduce_the sometimes a heuristic_method is used to obtain dramatic reduction of the candidates to all satisficing solutions and speedup the process of finding the proper pathway however on the contrary to brute_force the heuristic approaches do not guarantee to find a pathway even if there is one on the other hand one can reduce_the by first constructing a small sub network without losing all candidates and then applying the brute_force method to find all the proper pathways the approach proposed in this article follows this strategy using an analytical_method this article_presents an innovative solution to find all possible distinct sets of coherent enzyme catalyzed biochemical_reactions i e metabolic_pathways through which the source compound is turned into the target_compound to this end an analytical processing technique based on matrix operations helps us to provide a search_space reduction strategy and find all desired metabolic_pathways moreover our proposed algorithm can even find the k shortest_paths by setting proper parameters given that our proposed approach is based on matrix operations the operational complexity of these operations depends on the matrix dimensions while the use of bipartite graphs challenges the complexity in this context we preferred to employ a more appropriate model instead of the bipartite_graph indeed using the directed bipartite_graph causes our approach to bear large spatial and temporal costs i e size of the memory and the amount of time required to search through it which stem from intensive increase in the number of vertices and edges for these reasons we formulate the biochemical_reactions contained in the metabolic pathway_databases e g kegg metacyc by an and or graph_model and inverter graph majority inverter graph and and or graph are three different internal network representations used to provide a suitable environment for modeling in a wide area of problem domains such as logic optimization and synthesis among these graph models the use of and or graph and the search through it were proposed earlier than the others the and or graph is a typical graph in which the types of relations between vertices which can be either and or or a function of them determine the types of searching process steps that should be followed through the relations i e and and or has been inspired by two simple boolean gates i e boolean operations with the same names and finally the graph can be conceived as a boolean circuit among the aforementioned models and or graphs can better represent metabolic_reactions since the introduction of the and or graph it has been used in various applications and algorithms to this end we visualize the network of the biochemical_reactions as the boolean functions consisting of two variable and or operations for example in the metabolic reaction m m m the metabolite m is produced if the metabolites m and m are both present that is
