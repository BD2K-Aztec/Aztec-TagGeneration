multip schlo multi_label protein subchloroplast localization prediction with chou's pseudo amino_acid and a novel multi_label classifier motivation identifying protein subchloroplast localization in chloroplast organelle is very helpful for understanding the function of chloroplast proteins there have existed a few computational_prediction for protein subchloroplast localization however these existing works have ignored proteins with multiple subchloroplast locations when constructing prediction_models so that they can predict only one of all subchloroplast locations of this kind of multilabel proteins results to address this problem through utilizing label specific features and label correlations simultaneously a novel multilabel classifier was developed for predicting protein subchloroplast location s with both single and multiple location sites as an initial study the overall accuracy of our proposed algorithm reaches which is quite high to be able to become a promising tool for further studies availability_and an online web_server for our proposed algorithm named multip schlo was developed which are freely_accessible atchloroplasts are organelles in most green plant cells and also exists in some eukaryotic_organisms such as seaweed chloroplasts main function is to conduct photosynthesis where they capture and store the energy from the sunlight transform it to chemical_energy and finally release oxygen from water in addition to the important photosynthesis they are also responsible for carrying out a lot of other functions including fatty_acid and the immune_response in plants chloroplast proteins play different roles in the biological_processes mentioned above knowing the functions of these proteins is of significant value due to the very close relationship between the functions and localizations of chloroplast proteins identifying the subchloroplast localizations of these proteins in chloroplast organelle is very helpful for understanding the function of chloroplast proteins with in depth study of cell_organelles the researchers have found a number of substructures in cell_organelles such as nuclear chromatin heterochromatin nuclear_envelope nucleolus in the nucleus inner membrane outer_membrane in the mitochondria stroma thylakoid in the chloroplast and so on in order to more deeply understand the function of these proteins it is necessary to identify the subchloroplast localizations of these proteins in the organelle level as can be seen from the recently released uniprotkb_swiss database release there are a total ofchloroplast proteins where chloroplast proteins have subchloroplast localization annotations accounting for about of all chloroplast proteins however of the chloroplast proteins with subchloroplast localization annotations are annotated with experimental confidence and annotated with uncertain terms such as by similarity probable and potential therefore there are only chloroplast proteins with determined subchloroplast localization annotations which are about of all chloroplast proteins in other words subchloroplast localizations of more than half of the chloroplast proteins need to be further identified either by computational_methods or biological_experiments since the organelle is a more microscopic_structure unit relative to the cell it is more difficult and time consuming to determine protein sub subcellular_localizations by biological_experiments with explosively increasing of protein_sequences in the post genomic era the gap between the sequence number and function_annotations of chloroplast proteins will become more and more wide to fill the gap it is very necessary to develop new computational_prediction for predicting protein subchloroplast localizations in recent_years there have existed a few computational_prediction for protein sub subcellular_localizations such as subnuclear localization prediction submitochondria localization prediction and subchloroplast localization prediction concerned in this article in the field of subchloroplast localization prediction the first pioneering work is completed by they constructed the first public benchmark_dataset in the field and developed a new predictor based on pseudoamino acid composition pseaac and the evidence theoretic k nearest_neighbor et knn classifier since then other researchers have also proposed a few prediction_methods for protein subchloroplast localization however these existing works have the following drawbacks i only considering the small number of subchloroplast locations reducing practicality of prediction_methods ii the homologous bias of the benchmark_dataset adopted is too large to accurately_evaluate the performance of prediction_methods for instance the dataset constructed by du et_al has as high as protein_sequence iii more importantly ignoring proteins with multiple subchloroplast locations when constructing prediction_models so that these existing works will not be able to completely predict all the subchloroplast locations of these multilabel proteins it has been observed that more and more proteins have multiple subcellular or sub subcellular_locations actually multilabel proteins should not be ignored because they may have some special biological_functions worthy of our in depth notices recently some multilabel predictors have been developed for predicting subcellular_localization of proteins with both single and multiple sites such as iloc plant iloc animal plantmploc and mlpred euk a review article has concluded recent_advances in predicting multilabel attributes in molecular biosystems however none of the existing multilabel predictors was specially developed for chloroplast proteins in this article we aim to develop a novel computational_method that can predict single and multiple subchloroplast locations for chloroplast proteins simultaneously by overcoming the above three problems firstly we constructed a new benchmark_dataset that contains chloroplast proteins with both single and multiple subchloroplast locations to enlarge the prediction scope the number of subchloroplast locations concerned is increased from to to avoid redundancy and homology bias protein_sequence in the new constructed dataset is controlled under secondly through selecting features that are most related to each subchloroplast location respectively and taking_into correlations between different subchloroplast locations simultaneously we proposed a novel multilabel algorithm that can accurately_predict multilabel protein subchloroplast localizations finally we developed an online web_server for our proposed algorithm called multip schlo freely_accessible at http biomed zzuli edu cn bioinfo multip schlo in this article we further study sub structures of the chloroplast organelle and try to identify subchloroplast locations of proteins with both single and multiple sites all the existing predictors have the following drawbacks i only considering the small number of subchloroplast locations ii homologous bias of the benchmark_dataset adopted is too large iii more importantly ignoring proteins with multiple subchloroplast locations when constructing prediction_models in view of this we propose a novel multilabel prediction algorithm for identifying multilabel protein subchloroplast locations the main contributions of this article is as follows a new benchmark_dataset is constructed that contains chloroplast proteins with both single and multiple subchloroplast locations it not only covers much more subchloroplast locations but also has much less homology bias a novel multilabel algorithm is proposed through combining label specific features with label correlations which can predict multilabel protein subchloroplast locations accurately an online web_server for our proposed algorithm is established called multip schlo freely_accessible at
