sequence_analysis avia v annotation visualization and impact analysis of genomic_variants and genes as sequencing becomes cheaper and more widely available there is a greater need to quickly and effectively analyze large_scale genomic_data while the functionality of avia v whose implementation was based on annovar was comparable with other annotation web ser vers avia v represents an enhanced web_based server that extends genomic_annotations to cell specific_transcripts and protein level functional_annotations with avias improved interface users can better visualize their data perform comprehensive searches and categorize both coding and non coding variants availability_and avia is freely_available through the web at http avia abcc ncifcrf gov exome_sequencing has become the most popular means to evaluate variants in the context of disease many clinical panels focus on specific known genes associated with specific diseases or pathways accessing all available data about a given mutation can be difficult from comprehending each database or algorithm to obtaining the computational power to annotate filter and prioritize lists of variants to this end an updated version of the annotation visualization and impact analysis web_server avia v is presented which incorporates features to help users understand processes within a cell as it relates to disease avia v is a unique annotation portal in that it incorporates information from annotation databases and allows for custom annotations the new features of avia v increase its applicability as a hub for genomics gene and protein annotations as the number of databases and tools become more abundant it becomes increasingly time consuming for researchers to leverage all of the available tools and resources since very little is known about many genes and their role in the context of disease our approach is to provide users with the most comprehensive up to date data available this would promote exploratory_analysis and pathway visualization and help highlight biological dysfunction and increase the understanding of cellular_processes as they relate to disease together the extra functionalities detailed here help avia v mature as a hub for genomics gene and protein annotations by integrating several different types of databases and applications in a fast comprehensive and significant manner
