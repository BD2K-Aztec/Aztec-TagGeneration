systems_biology rcpi r bioconductor_package to generate various descriptors of proteins compounds and their interactions in chemoinformatics and bioinformatics fields one of the main computational challenges in various predictive_modeling is to find a suitable way to effectively represent the molecules under investigation such as small_molecules proteins and even complex interactions to solve this problem we developed a freely_available r bioconductor_package called compoundprotein interaction with r rcpi for complex molecular representation from drugs proteins and more complex interactions including proteinprotein and compound protein interactions rcpi could calculate a large number of structural and physicochemical features of proteins and peptides from amino_acid molecular_descriptors of small_molecules from their topology and proteinprotein_interaction and compoundprotein interaction descriptors in addition to main functionalities rcpi could also provide a number of useful auxiliary utilities to facilitate the users need with the descriptors calculated by this package the users could conveniently apply various statistical machine_learning in r to solve various biological and drug research_questions in computational_biology and drug_discovery availability_and rcpi is freely_available from the bioconductor siteto develop a powerful model for prediction tasks one of the most important things to consider is how to effectively represent the molecules under investigation such as small_molecules proteins and even complex interactions by a descriptor in the field of chemoinformatics molecular_descriptors for small_molecules have frequently been used in quantitative structure activity property relationship qsar qspr virtual_screening database_search ranking drug adme t prediction and other drug_discovery processes these descriptors capture and magnify distinct aspects of molecular topology to investigate how molecular_structures affect molecular_properties in the field of bioinformatics sequence derived structural and physicochemical features have been widely used for predicting protein structural and functional_classes proteinprotein_interactions subcellular_locations and peptides of specific properties etc these features are highly useful for representing and distinguishing proteins or peptides of different structural functional and interaction profiles currently their combinations were routinely used to characterize drug_target and predict new drugtarget associations to identify potential_drug following the spirit of chemogenomics several programs for computing molecular_features have been developed such as tops mode cinfony dragon codessa profeat biojava biopython pseaac propy etc although a number of tools which are either open sources or commercial softwares have been developed and widely used in the two fields their applications only focus on the analysis of either small_molecules or proteins to the best of our knowledge there is currently no open source_code or tools available for the integration and analysis of increasingly popular interaction problems we developed a comprehensive molecular representation tool called compoundprotein interaction with r rcpi to emphasize the integration of chemoinformatics and bioinformatics into a chemogenomics platform for drug_discovery rcpi mainly focuses on the study of molecular representation techniques for not only small_molecules and proteins but also interactions of proteinprotein and compoundprotein we recommend rcpi to analyze and represent various complex molecular data under investigation further we hope that the package will be helpful when exploring questions concerning structures functions and interactions of various molecular data in the context of systems_biology rcpi contains a selection of molecular_descriptors to analyze classify and compare complex molecular_network in the context of network biology pharmacology they facilitate to exploit machine_learning to drive hypothesis from complex molecular datasets the usefulness of these molecular_descriptors covered by rcpi for representing structural_features of various molecular data has been sufficiently demonstrated by a number of published_studies of the development of machine_learning prediction systems in the future work we plan to apply integrated features on various biological and drug research_questions and extend the range of functions with new promising descriptors for the coming versions of rcpi
