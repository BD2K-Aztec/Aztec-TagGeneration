genome_analysis svgmap configurable image browser for experimental_data spatial data visualization is very useful to represent biological data and quickly interpret the results for instance to show the expression pattern of a gene in different tissues of a fly an intuitive approach is to draw the fly with the corresponding tissues and color the expression of the gene in each of them however the creation of these visual representations may be a burdensome task here we present svgmap a java_application that automatizes the generation of high_quality graphics for singular data items e g genes and biological conditions svgmap contains a browser that allows the user to navigate the different images created and can be used as a web_based results publishing tool availability svgmap is freely_available as precompiled java package as well as source_code at http bg upf edu svgmap it requires java and any recent web_browser with javascript enabled the software can be run on linux mac os x and windows systems contact modern biological_experiments generally generate big datasets that need to be visualized effectively in order to interpret the results some available tools for genomic_data analysis focus on representing huge datasets in one figure using visualization_techniques like heat maps and circular plots this focus on big_data should not leave out the development of tools to represent singular data for example representing expression of a single gene in such cases the viewer can be provided with figures that are more straightforward to understand like a textbook figure particularly figures in svg format the w c standard to design high_quality images and graphics are well suited for the graphical_representation of biological data with svgmap we present a tool that is well fitted for the visualization of biological data through the generation of individualized figures in a generic and interactive way it is a standalone java_application and can be executed on any system with to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as java or higher installed the software instantiates a web_server that can be accessed through common web_browsers svgmap can be executed on a personal computer or can be incorporated into an existing web_server optionally using an external database the development of svgmap and its svgmap browser was motivated to cover the need we had in collaboration with an experimental group to support the study of gene_expression in arabidopsis_thaliana roots but has been programmed in a generic manner such that it can be adapted to any other data types our tool helped them to study their genes of interest and gave insight in which tissue they are expressed and with which level of expression furthermore it serves as well as a platform for the publication of their data and images in this collaboration svgmap has been proved to be straightforward and very useful in our opinion svgmap has a wide_range to represent biological data to illustrate that we have prepared four diverse examples i visualization of expression levels of yeast_cell genes in each part of the cell_cycle m g s g ii visualization of copy_number data for different types of cancer from intogen data iii visualization of gene_expression in different drosophila tissues from flyatlas and iv visualization of cell_compartments affected by transcriptomic alterations in cancer_types with the flexible svg format as basis of our tool it is important to stress that svg images can be reused and adapted because the graphics are described by text any svg that has been published in public_domain like the wikimedia documents http commons wikimedia org can be loaded in a svg editor in order to add or remove objects and annotate them
