ova integrating molecular and physical phenotype data from multiple biomedical_domain ontologies with variant filtering for enhanced variant_prioritization motivation exome_sequencing has become a de facto standard method for mendelian disease_gene in recent_years yet identifying disease_causing among thousands of candidate variants remains a non trivial task results here we describe a new variant_prioritization tool ova ontology variant analysis in which user provided phenotypic_information is exploited to infer deeper biological_context ova combines a knowledge based_approach with a variant filtering framework it reduces the number of candidate variants by considering genotype and predicted effect on protein_sequence and scores the remainder on biological_relevance to the query phenotype we take advantage of several ontologies in order to bridge knowledge across multiple biomedical domains and facilitate computational_analysis of annotations pertaining to genes diseases phenotypes tissues and pathways in this way ova combines information regarding molecular and physical phenotypes and integrates both human and model_organism data to effectively prioritize variants by assessing performance on both known and novel disease mutations we show that ova performs biologically_meaningful candidate variant_prioritization and can be more accurate than another recently_published candidate variant_prioritization tool availability_and ova is freely_accessible atthe application of next_generation for disease_gene or clinical_diagnostics can generate large volumes of data often resulting in identification of thousands of candidate_disease or variants a healthy individual genome can harbor more than a hundred genuine loss_of making the identification of mutations responsible for a given phenotype a non trivial task as systematic experimental_verification of each variant is infeasible several computational prioritization methods have emerged in recent_years that attempt to tackle this problem we use datasets and to assess ova performance for simulated disease cases both with and without a previous known molecular basis for each disease gene tested in datasets and we remove any known disease or human phenotype associations in our database in order to simulate cases of novel gene_discovery human phenotype related features that directly link the test gene to disease are also replaced with unknown values in the instance classification step we rank each test gene with respect to disease together with randomly_selected genes from the pool of all human genes which have at least minimal gene_ontology in order to avoid any bias as known disease genes are rarely entirely unannotated we assess three methods for obtaining the final scores as discussed in the methods sectionaverage a weighted_average approach and a machine_learning approach receiver_operator roc_curves and corresponding area under the curve auc values were calculated using r package rocr shows the roc_curves obtained using dataset whileshows the roc_curves obtained using dataset there is a notable difference in performance between the three methods that is consistent across the datasets used our model which was trained using features is able to prioritize candidate_disease with greater_accuracy than the average or a weighted_average approaches using the same scores as expected there is a notable difference in performance between datasets and performance of ova is greatly_enhanced auc up to where knowledge about previously_identified molecular causes of the disease is available however extending the search to diseases which cause similar_phenotypes allows the prioritization of cases where little is known about the molecular causes of a disease that is still robust auc up to the key_parameter in ova is the phenotype filter in order to ascertain how sensitive our algorithm is to various amounts of input noise we have used dataset to simulate cases where the phenotype is inaccurately or inadequately described introducing additional irrelevant query phenotypes had less of an impact on the accuracy of the results than excluding relevant terms supplementaryand b however our method tolerates minor levels of noise ova incorporates an extensive variant filtering step available for vcf files including support for multi sample vcf files with multiple affected unaffected patients that can be often available to researchers studying rare genetic_diseases as such we compared variant_prioritization capabilities of ova with another recently reported variant_prioritization tool exomewalker which uses a current state of the art algorithm for network based gene_prioritization coupled with a variant scoring approach we use dataset to see how these two tools compare in order to simulate novel gene_discovery we supply all known genes for the disease except the test gene as seeds to exomewalker for ova any associations between test gene and disease are removed as previously described for both tools we provide the inheritance_mode of the disease for each test instance and use default_parameters shows the disease gene rank distributions obtained by both tools out of vcf files in of the cases ova ranked the true disease gene first with exomewalker performing similarly at a total of of instances were ranked in the top by ova compared with by exomewalker although exomewalker scored of all cases very accurately and the other poorly only test cases were ranked outside the top by ova additionally as ova can be used to prioritize genes as well as variants we have opted to compare our approach with another gene_prioritization tool g d g d can prioritize candidates using data from go annotations sequence_similarity mesh_terms and string protein_protein we have chosen this tool for comparison due to parallels in data_sources used by ova use of seed gene input which enables a cross_validation based testing approach that we applied to ova and exomewalker and finally a straight_forward web_application that facilitates automation for large testing data_sets using dataset we provided as input to g d a mb genomic_region containing a test gene and other known genes associated with the disease asroc curves showing the performance of ova while using dataset a and dataset b each dataset was prioritized using three methodsthe average green the weighted_average red and a classifier blue built using a supervised_learning approachintegrating molecular and physical phenotype dataseeds and similarly prioritized all genes within the same region with ova although ova significantly_outperformed g d auc versus supplementary some of the differences in accuracy could be accounted for by somewhat outdated data used by g d as of this writing last updated in finally in order to verify that our results are consistent with real cases of novel disease_gene we use our model to prioritize recently_published novel disease gene_mutations dataset we use a version of our database frozen before publication dates to assess performance summarizes the results the ranking is overall somewhat poorer than that observed using our other datasets with out of genes ranked in the top the development of open biomedical_ontologies has exploded in the last decade and alongside it the coverage and accuracy of annotations here we take advantage of this rich resource to bring together ontologies from across multiple domains to produce ova a knowledge based gene and variant_prioritization tool ova utilizes human and model_organism phenotypes functional_annotations curated pathways cellular localizations and anatomical terms to find genes most relevant to a query phenotype utilizing model_organism phenotype data in a generalized gene_prioritization approach is becoming more viable as coverage increases gene_ontology have proved to be one of the most frequently utilized sources of gene functional knowledge in computational_biology with numerous applications taking_advantage of this structured and highly curated resource go has also been heavily utilized as a data source for various candidate disease_gene applications however while candidate prioritization methods using gene_ontology semantic_similarity have generally been demonstrated to be effective there are a number of drawbacks that this type of methodology suffers from that can detract from usability accuracy and utility the majority of tools catalogued at gene_prioritization portal require the user to supply seed genesgenes already known to be associated with the diseaseand score candidates based on similarity to these this is a major_limitation of this approach as in the case of rare or novel phenotypes any prioritization based on similarity to known disease genes is impossible furthermore the quality of available annotations of the supplied genes largely determines the success of this type of approach while also allowing for little functional_heterogeneity among disease genes here we supplement this approach by building links across multiple ontologies this allows enhancing the functional profile against which all candidate_genes are scored by reasoning directly from a disease phenotype as well as known genes consequently this approach eliminates the requirement for the user to supply known seed genes and reduces the reliance on quality seed gene_annotations the integration of data from across multiple ontologies can supplement knowledge where it may be incomplete or inadequate in a particular domain although most human genes now have go annotations available shallow annotationsi e low ic termsare still prevalent similarly there are a number of terms that while they may not be considered uninformative are not meaningful for candidate_gene without further context two genes_annotated with the term regulation of transcription dna templated go would be considered highly functionally_similar and yet could participate in regulation of entirely different pathways accordingly pathway ontology annotations can serve to fill in this knowledge gap helping to decide whether a gene is truly relevant to the query phenotype and improving prioritization accuracy by removing noise here we simulate novel gene_discovery in well and poorly_characterized diseases and show that our method is capable of meaningful candidate_gene even when direct functional knowledge about the disease is lacking by inferring new gene_disease through phenotype semantic similarity_search and cross ontology bridges ova attempts to deduce missing annotations enabling gene_prioritization for new and rare human_diseases and supplementing the functional profile of better characterized phenotypes we show that our model distinguishes relevant_genes accurately and coupled with our variant filtering_approach performs better than another recently_published variant_prioritization tool knowledge based candidate_gene variant_prioritization methods have been known to perform worse than reported when predicting novel disease genes however large_scale assessment using novel disease genes is not feasible cross validationbased methods of individually removing direct disease gene_associations can serve to simulate novel gene_discovery by ensuring that the test gene does not contribute to the query annotation profile however there is a degree of knowledge circularity in ontology annotations that is difficult to account for by prioritizing vcf files containing newly_reported mutations in novel disease genes we show that there is agreement between these results and those obtained from a larger simulated dataset and although the novel variant dataset prioritization was somewhat less accurate thus we maintain that our results on previously described disease genes represent a reasonable approximation of the true accuracy of ova through an interactive and intuitive web_interface ova allows the user to control many aspects of the prioritization process ova employs the human phenotype ontology to facilitate detailedphenotypes queries in addition to previously described diseases
