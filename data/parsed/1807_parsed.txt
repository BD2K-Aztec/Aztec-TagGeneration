feral network based_classifier with application to breast_cancer outcome_prediction motivation breast_cancer outcome_prediction based on gene_expression is an important strategy for personalize patient_care to improve performance and consistency of discovered markers of the initial molecular classifiers network based outcome prediction_methods nops have been proposed in spite of the initial claims recent_studies revealed that neither performance nor consistency can be improved using these methods nops typically rely on the construction of meta genes by averaging the expression of several genes connected in a network that encodes protein interactions or pathway_information in this article we expose several fundamental issues in nops that impede on the prediction power consistency of discovered markers and obscures biological_interpretation results to overcome these issues we propose feral a network based_classifier that hinges upon the sparse group_lasso which performs simultaneous selection of marker_genes and training of the prediction model an important feature of feral and a significant departure from existing nops is that it uses multiple operators to summarize genes into meta genes this gives the classi fier the opportunity to select the most relevant meta gene for each gene_set extensive evaluation revealed that the discovered markers are markedly more stable across independent datasets moreover interpretation of the marker_genes detected by feral reveals valuable mechanistic insight into the etiology of breast_cancer availability_and all code is available for download at http homepage tudelft nl a resources feral feral zip breast_cancer is the most frequently diagnosed type of cancer and one of the leading causes of death in women the main cause of death in these patients is however not the primary_tumor but its metastases at distant_sites e g in bone lung liver and brain typical risk_factors such as lymph_node and tumor_size are insufficient to accurately_predict the risk of metastasis in patients over the last few years substantial efforts have been made on deriving molecular classifiers to predict clinical_outcome based on gene_expression profiles_obtained from the primary_tumor vant a fundamental limitation of breast_cancer outcome_prediction is that it has proved very difficult to obtain a robust classifier performance across different datasets it was found that despite properly cross_validated classifier training prediction_performance decreases dramatically when a classifier trained on one dataset is applied to another one moreover the prognostic gene_signatures identified using these classifiers have poor concordance across different studies this points to a lack of a unified mechanism through which clinical_outcome can be explained from gene_expression which is still a major_hurdle in clinical cancer_biology several studies ascribe the lack of classification robustness to insufficient patient sample_size other causes may be the inherent measurement noise in microarray_experiments or heterogeneity in the samples to mitigate these issues breast_cancer datasets are often v c the author published_by in this work we proposed a network based outcome_prediction method feral that exploits network information in molecular_classification of breast_cancer outcome our method deviates from traditional nops in two important aspects first feral includes several different integration strategies to construct meta genes including a novel supervised integration strategy our results indicate that the final classification model frequently uses meta genes produced by these constructors often even multiple meta genes based on the same gene_set this underscores the importance of extending traditional meta genes based on a simple average the second important improvement is that feral performs simultaneous selection and training of the classifier by employing the sgl this mitigates the need for pre ranking of genes and or meta genes which is likely to severely reduce the stability of selected genes feral reached a significant performance increase compared with all standard nops including those that contained significant improvements made by us this improvement was also obtained using a random_network leading to the conclusion that the biological_knowledge encoded in the network is not used to obtain these improvements the stability of marker_genes improves substantially as a result of the procedure implemented in feral this improvement was not observed when the random_network was used indicating that the biological_knowledge contributes to the stability of the gene_signatures this improvement was exclusively observed for the ppi_network and not for the co expression network because feral attains robust performance and stable marker gene_selection the selected genes and gene_sets might reveal insight into the underlying aberrant processes that play a role in this complex disease we find that almost all the gene_sets used in the final model were enriched for cancer related processes the four gene_sets that were studied in more detail revealed very strong suggestive evidence for their involvement in breast_cancer with clear links to mapk pi k and akt_signaling and regulation by stathmin in summary although classification_performance of breast_cancer outcome obtained with nops is unlikely to improve beyond auc we have shown that feral achieves much more stable marker gene_selection that enables valuable mechanistic insight into the etiology of breast_cancer
