conpair concordance and contamination estimator for matched tumor normal pairs motivation sequencing of matched tumor and normal samples is the standard study_design for reliable_detection of somatic alterations however even very low levels of cross sample contamination significantly impact calling of somatic_mutations because contaminant germline variants can be incorrectly interpreted as somatic there are currently no sequence only based_methods that reliably estimate contamination_levels in tumor_samples which frequently display copy_number changes as a solution we developed conpair a tool for detection of sample swaps and cross individual contamination in whole_genome and whole exome tumornormal sequencing_experiments results on a ladder of in silico contaminated samples we demonstrated that conpair reliably measures contamination_levels as low as even in presence of copy_number changes we also estimated contamination_levels in glioblastoma wgs and wxs tumornormal datasets from tcga and showed that they strongly correlate with tumornormal concordance as well as with the number of germline variants called as somatic by several widely used somatic callers availability_and the method is available at https github com nygenome the decreasing cost of high_throughput allows analysis of larger number of samples than before which as an unfortunate side effect increases the chances of sample mix_ups and contamination cancer studies often jointly analyze matched tumornormal tn samples in order to detect somatic_mutations that are present in the tumor even a very low_level of cross individual contamination in the tumor sample may introduce many low allele_frequency germline variants that will be interpreted as somatic by somatic variant_calling resulting in greatly_reduced specificity supplementary detecting sample swaps and low_level contamination in tumor_samples are critical quality_control steps that should precede every somatic analysis however estimating contamination in tumor_samples is confounded by frequent copy_number that affect allelic ratio distributions verifybamid and contest have emerged as standard methods to estimate sample contamination verifybamid maximizes the likelihood of a contamination level in a two sample mixture_model given the alleles and base qualities using a grid_search over a range of contamination fractions and refining the result using a numerical root finding method verifybamid provides an accurate measure for contamination in mostly diploid copy neutral samples however it may interpret copy_number driven allelic_imbalance frequently seen in cancer as contamination contest calculates the maximum a posteriori estimate of contamination based on the base identities and quality v c the author published_by in silico contaminated data we constructed two independent sets of in silico contaminated cancer samples by mixing reads from bam_files from copy_number aberrant tcga glioblastoma exomes at a ladder from to yielding a total of samples at different contamination_levels a in each set for each sample we estimated a using conpair verifybamid and contest sequence only mode our results indicate a better agreement between conpair and the ground_truth inand d to assess which method was more accurate we correlated the contamination estimates with the tn concordance values_calculated based only on markers that were homozygous in the normal sample tumor_samples with tn concordance values close to cannot be significantly contaminated supplementary based on this fact we were able to show that verifybamid highly overestimated a on the majority of the tumor_samples and contest overestimated a on the subset of the wga samples the results returned by conpair show a monotonic dependency between the tn concordance and contamination values as an independent metric we also looked at the number of known germline variants called as somatic by three somatic callers mutect lofreq and strelka these numbers were strongly correlated with the contamination in the tumor_samples returned by conpair spearman r the obtained results suggest that conpair is more robust in estimating contamination_levels in the light of different library preparation_methods
