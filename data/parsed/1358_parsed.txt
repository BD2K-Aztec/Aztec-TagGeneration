detection and removal of spatial bias in multiwell assays motivation multiplex readout assays are now increasingly being performed using microfluidic automation in multiwell format for instance the library of integrated_network based cellular signatures lincs has produced gene_expression for tens_of of distinct cell perturbations using a well plate format this dataset is by far the largest well gene_expression measurement assay ever performed we investigated the gene_expression of a million samples from the lincs dataset and found that the vast_majority of the tested plates were affected by a significant d spatial bias results using a novel algorithm combining spatial_autocorrelation detection and principal_component we could remove most of the spatial bias from the lincs dataset and show in parallel a dramatic_improvement of similarity between biological_replicates assayed in different plates the proposed methodology is fully general and can be applied to any highly multiplexed assay performed in multiwell format a revolution has occurred in the field of quantitative transcriptomics in the last years fueled by a significant drop in the cost of technologies for multiple gene_expression such technologies namely gene microarrays and rnaseq are now standard_procedures in biological and medical_research and they are becoming increasingly more popular as robust research and diagnostic_tools in all biological fields spanning from crop research to drug_discovery and from microbiology to personalized_medicine recently both gene_expression assays and other multiplexed readout assays have been implemented in a multiwell format microplate lending themselves to significant microfluidic automation and scale up this type of experiments lend themselves to detection and normalization of a variety of potential_bias sources including effects representing d spatial bias introduced by the specific microfluidics apparatus for instance multiplex gene_expression has been recently used as a reporter for large_scale cell perturbation assays allowing for the quantitative characterization of the corresponding perturbagens as inducers of specific transcriptional_responses at the molecular level molecular_phenotypes this new class of studies named gene_expression high_throughput ge hts promise to have significant impact on biomedical_research and have already shown their potential to accelerate drug_discovery for v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com doi bioinformatics btw the overarching achievement of transcriptomics is the ability to obtain large_quantities of highly_reliable gene_expression data representing multiple cellular_states thus as dataset size increases with microfluidic automation computational_approaches for data_processing are becoming more and more important this study shows that d spatial bias likely associated with gradient driven differential conditions_affecting the microfluidic setup is a significant source of error that can be effectively detected and corrected previous_studies have dealt with similar problems in contexts other than that of gene_expression measurement however these studies simply evaluated the issue without proposing a solution or proposed a solution that involved changing the design layout of the microplates in other cases the systematic_bias was observed in high_throughput technologies with a reduced set of experimental_variables no method to our knowledge addresses the spatial bias problem in the context of multivariate assay scenarios like the lincs dataset therefore we propose here a pure data_driven solution for multivariate gene_expression based on reducing the principal_components of the variance most associated with spatial bias we introduce a tunable parameter that can either be set a priori or can be assessed to optimize biological replicate agreement in a largein the upper cluster b and in the lower cluster c in their respectively most co segregating pcs multiplate assay our solution significantly_improved replicate similarity in the lincs dataset an effect that could not be achieved by simply removing equivalent levels of global and non specific variance from gene_expression the optimal parameters differed between specific portions of the lincs dataset but every subset analyzed benefited from the bias removal independently of the analyzed cell_line in fact these results strongly support the incorporation of spatial bias analysis and removal as a critical step in the normalization of all ge hts assays while spatial bias can occur both before and after cell_lysis and nucleic_acids extraction presence of spatial bias in biological_process enrichment values on most plates and consistent enrichment of a reduced set of biological_processes on the most biased principal_components suggests that part of such effects are originated prior to cell_lysis processes most strongly biased on average across all plates in kd oe and cpc were associated to homeostasis and apoptosis our analysis of the principal component coefficients shows differential cell_proliferation associated exclusively with the sample positioning on the microplates a recurring effect that seems to be independent from the microplate or the cell_line affected by the bias this difference in cell_proliferation can be caused by differential_growth conditions of the plated cells perhaps due to a gradient in the evaporation of the medium partially connected to the parallel enrichment of potassium_channel activity no matter how carefully_monitored and executed any ge hts experiment can suffer from such operational bias issues the proposed method allows for the detection and correction of the most significant location specific undesired perturbation_effects regardless of the experimental stage at which they were introduced given that the lincs dataset is the first of its kind such spatial bias in multivariate gene_expression data has never been observed at this scale before our method is similar to pca based noise removal techniques since it operates on the principal component space in order to improve the measurement reliability however while previous methods remove the low variance components to reduce random noise our method is the first that specifically captures location dependent effects and decreases their contribution to the corrected dataset
