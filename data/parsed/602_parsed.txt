genetics_and automated design of paralogue ratio test assays for the accurate and rapid typing of copy_number motivation genomic copy_number cnv can influence susceptibility to common diseases high_throughput measurement of gene_copy on large_numbers of samples is a challenging yet critical stage in confirming observations from sequencing or array comparative_genome cgh the paralogue ratio test prt is a simple cost_effective method of accurately determining copy_number by quantifying the amplification ratio between a target and reference amplicon prt has been successfully_applied to several studies_analyzing common cnv however its use has not been widespread because of difficulties in assay_design results we present prtprimer www prtprimer org software for automated prt assay_design in addition to stand alone software the web_site includes a database of pre_designed assays for the human_genome at an average spacing of kb and a web_interface for custom assay_design other reference_genomes can also be analyzed through local installation of the software the usefulness of prtprimer was tested within known cnv and showed reproducible quantification this software and database provide assays that can rapidly genotype cnv cost effectively on a large number of samples and will enable the widespread_adoption of prt availability prtprimer is available in two forms a perl script version and higher that can be run from the command_line on linux systems and as a service on the prtprimer web_site www prtprimer org copy_number cnv is a pervasive and extensive source of variation between individual_genomes in humans and many other species a genome_wide picture of cnv has been provided in humans by large consortia typically using arraycomparative genomic hybridization for example a key analysis used an oligonucleotide tiling_array to assay common cnv of kb and found that two diploid human_genomes typically differed in cnvs covering a length of mb of the genome for the individuals studied from two populations taken together of the genome was shown to be copy_number variable in another study itsara et_al studied large rare cnv and showed that of individuals have a cnv of kb pang et_al constructed a comprehensive map of cnv in a single_genome and estimated structural_variation to cover mb a region including genes there is considerable evidence for cnv affecting phenotype much of which comes from disease studies in humans association analysis of common cnv with phenotypes is limited in part by the inherent noise in typing complex cnv with acgh technology or quantitative_real qpcr nevertheless the wellcome_trust wtccc analyzed the genome_wide association between common cnv had minor_allele and reported five robust associations with complex_diseases even though they included only of cnv with a minor_allele the wellcome_trust case other well founded associations include the effect of high b defensin copy_number on psoriasis the effect of cyp d copy_number on drug_metabolism and the role of a globin copy_number in a thalassemia and protection against severe_malaria rare cnvs have also been shown to have major effects in human disease particularly in neurological_disorders such as schizophrenia and autism although methodological_issues have complicated interpretation in drosophila_melanogaster the cyp g gene_copy is associated with resistance to the insecticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and amplification of the pfmdr gene confers mefloquine resistance in plasmodium_falciparum in dogs the diploid copy_number of amy b ranges between and and may be involved in the adaption to a starch rich_diet in early domestication these both provide compelling_evidence for a functional effect of cnv in other species to maximize the power of association studies of cnv and phenotype it is necessary to characterize cnv in terms of the actual integer number of copies per diploid_genome etc in a cost effective_manner on large_numbers of dna samples genome_wide genotyping of cnv is possible by acgh sequence read_depth analysis of next_generation and analysis of hybridization signal_intensity from snp_genotyping to

distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work these methods can detect cnv but are limited in their ability to accurately call integer copy_number of complex multiallelic cnvs a comprehensive comparison of array platforms and cnv_detection software showed concordance between approaches and reproducibility of replicate experiments at for example current sequence read_depth analysis methods have high false_discovery relatively low detection_rates and are crucially dependent on the quality of read_alignment to the reference_genome in addition micrograms of dna are often required by these methods with whole_genome amplification not being viable as current methods are known to introduce inconsistent copy_number bias there are three commonly used locus specific methods that attempt to meet the challenge of accurate and efficient genotyping of cnv in large_numbers of samples multiplex ligation dependent amplification qpcr and the paralogue ratio test prt the multiplex ligation dependent amplification method is used routinely in clinical_genetics for screening disease genes for exons and has been shown to accurately infer integer copy_number even on challenging multicopy loci eijk van os and schouten however it is propriety expensive and commercially_available only for certain loci and often ng of dna is required qpcr is frequently used as a high_throughput method for cnv typing particularly using fluorescent quencher systems such as taqman however the method is susceptible to variation in dna quality and often gives apparently precise but inaccurate results at multicopy loci this has been a bane of human cnv studies leading to controversy in the field prt is a form of quantitative_pcr that differs from the conventional method in one important aspect by careful design of the primers targeting paralogous sequences one primer_pair is used to amplify a putative cnv target locus relative to a single_copy reference locus this makes the kinetics of target and reference amplification similar and results in increased accuracy of integer copy_number calling the target and reference amplicons can be separated by size using electrophoresis or by sequence using pyrosequencing restriction_enzyme digest or real_time with sequence specific fluorescent_reporter probes prt assays have been successfully_applied in a number of human cnv studies currently prt assay_design involves a laborious process of selecting either a self chain segment a short sequence that matches to more than one place in the genome but is not a known repeat element or a low copy_number repeat within the target_sequence the selected sequence is then mapped to the reference_genome using blat and the sequence_alignment of the target and paralogue s examined to identify two identically matched sequences long enough to allow primer_design and flanking a stretch of dna either of different length or sequence last the putative primers are assessed using in silico pcr to check that they produce only two amplicons of the predicted size failing which the process will need to be repeated this current design approach_requires several hours for each assay and is dependent on self chain or a low copy_number repeat_sequence in the target interval which limits the number of assays that can be designed in addition there is some probability that an assay will not successfully transfer into the laboratory these problems have prevented the widespread_adoption of prt despite its benefits over other technologies but could be overcome by an automated approach to assay_design with this in mind we have developed the software prtprimer and the web_resource www prtprimer org prtprimer is aimed at all users who would benefit from designing prt assays for the human_genome the software can be installed locally or run through the web_resource is optimized for multicore systems and can be adapted to use genomes from other species in this article we describe a resource of off_the prt assays as well as for custom design of assays this resource and prts in general is conceived as an accessible method of validating and replicating cnv data generated by high_throughput such as array_cgh snp_genotyping or genome_scale sequencing prt allows the accurate typing of copy_number at individual genomic_loci in hundreds of dna samples at a low_cost the simplest form of prt assays can be typed using pcr with unlabeled oligonucleotides and agarose_gels at a cost affordable by any laboratory to increase throughput or reduce labor power prt assays can be multiplexed using capillary_electrophoresis or by qpcr previously the utility of the prt had been limited by the difficulty of assay_design this has meant in practice that prt has been used by a limited number of laboratories with experience of the design_issues prtprimer overcomes this limitation by allowing users to either use the pre_designed assays or if no suitable ones are found to run the software to generate custom assays this facility should open up the use of prt to a diverse range of laboratories that want type cnv in patient collections the typical scenario we envisage is where array or sequencing_data have identified a particular cnv as being possibly associated with a phenotype and researchers want to type their own patient cohort for the same cnv without resorting to whole genome_analysis whether because of affordability issues or lack of sufficient dna large_genomic laboratories may want to use prt as an easy method of replicating high_throughput data by an alternative method with accurate quantification of copy_number the software implementation of prtprimer involves a pipeline with genomic_data passing through two well established and publically available packages primer and ispcr followed by data sorting filtering and output the approach relies on bruteforce computation to design a high number of potential pcr_products in a genomic_region align all of the primer_pairs to the genome using blat to identify those that amplify exactly two products and then filter for those that have the desirable characteristics of a prt assay this approach contrasts with the current method of using genome_annotation to guide assay_design allowing a far greater number of assays to be designed over a wider proportion of the genome assays in the pre_designed database are not randomly_distributed but fall into clusters of overlapping amplicons many of the amplicons within a cluster will vary by just a few base_pairs at each end and therefore do not represent truly different assays however other clusters will represent multiple assays that overlap on a higher_level the distribution of the clusters is also not random with occasional gaps of kb although the mean gap is kb of cnvs kb a high proportion is tagged by prt assays in the database smaller cnvs are less likely to contain a pre_designed pr for quantifying gene_copy the ideal prt assay will be between the first and last exons a situation that exists for around half of genes although of genes have an assay within kb for smaller cnvs and the remaining of genes it may be possible to obtain assays using the software directly with altered parameters despite the high_density of assays and clusters across the genome there remain intractable parts of the genome where assay_design is not possible presumably because of the lack of suitable repeat elements for targets in these limited regions an alternative technology such as conventional qpcr will be needed it should be noted that although the assays produced by prtprimer are bioinformatically predicted to produce two distinguishable amplification products they require laboratory validation before use this resource is primarily focused on the human_genome but the underlying software can be easily adapted for other
