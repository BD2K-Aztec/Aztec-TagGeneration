ppus a web_server to predict pus specific pseudouridine sites motivation pseudouridine w catalyzed by pseudouridine synthase pus is the most abundant rna_modification and has important_cellular developing an algorithm to identify w sites is an important work and it is better if the algorithm could assign which pus modifies the w sites here we developed ppus http lyh pkmu cn ppus the first web_server to predict pus specific w sites ppus employed support_vector as the classifier and used nucleotides around w sites as the features currently ppus could accurately_predict new w sites for pus pus and pus in yeast and pus in human ppus is well designed and friendly to user pseudouridine w the most abundant rna_modification has important_cellular for example ablation of rrna w modification by cbf deletion in s cerevisae is lethal and mutation of human pus leads to mitochondrial_myopathy and sideroblastic anemia identifying w sites is certain an important work w was known present in different categories of non_coding such as trnas rrnas and snrna recently using newly_developed w seq psi seq or pseudo seq methods three works for the first time revealed that w is also present in mrna w is catalyzed by pseudouridine synthase pus and different w sites are catalyzed by different puss however to our knowledge there is only one tool developed for prediction of w sites in trna no tool is available to predict w sites in mrna and other categories of rnas not mention predicting which pus modifies the w sites in this work using pus specific w sites found in recent works we developed an algorithm to predict pus specific w sites the algorithm could accurately_predict w sites modified by pus pus and pus in yeast and pus in human any rna_sequence can be used as input finally we implemented the algorithm in our web_server ppus ppus is well designed and friendly to user as described in methods w sites and the puss that modified them were gotten from recent works first we wanted to test whether it was possible to develop an algorithm to predict w sites if exclude the information of which pus modified the sites we put all known yeast w sites together as gold_standard positives and got equal number of negatives by random_sampling unfortunately as shown in the median precision recall f and auc were and respectively the performance was poor showing that if excluding pus specific modification information it was hard to distinguish w sites from non w sites second it was reported that pus pus pus recognized aw guwcnanycy and ugwag respectively thus we wanted to know whether it was possible to distinguish w sites catalyzed by a certain pus from non w sites fortunately as shown in the classifier performed excellent on pus pus and pus in yeast and pus in human with median f and respectively however it performed_poorly on pus pus and cbf in yeast and dkc in human with median f and respectively this might because the feature nucleotides were not found in this work no rna category information was used for classifier training so the classifiers should be rna category insensitive in other words any rna_sequence can be used as input third we validated the yeast and human pus classifiers with independent datasets as shown in there were and positive samples for yeast and human pus synthases respectively to test the yeast pus classifier we used the human pus w sites as an independent dataset and finally found that of the w sites can be correctly_predicted similarly we used the yeast w sites as an independent dataset to test the human pus classifier and found that of the yeast w sites can be correctly_predicted both results showed that the classifiers were efficient in conclusion we for the first time developed an algorithm to efficiently predict pus specific w sites we implemented the algorithm in our web_server ppus we think ppus will be an important tool for biologist in the field pos positive pre precision rec recall l r number of nucleotides at the left right of the w site all yeast all w sites found in yeast auc area_under
