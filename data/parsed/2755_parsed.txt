sequence_analysis lotus a new domain associated with small_rna pathways in the germline we describe here lotus a hitherto uncharacterized small globular_domain which was identified using sensitive sequence_profile analysis the lotus domain is found in germline specific proteins that are present in the nuage polar granules of germ_cells tdrd and tdrd two mammalian members of the germline tudor group possess three copies of the lotus domain in their extreme n termini the tudor domains of these proteins bind symmetric dimethyl arginines present on the germ_cell specific piwi proteins which form a particular clade of argonaute_proteins piwi proteins interact with a specific class of non_coding piwi_interacting pirnas and play_a in the repression silencing of transposons and possibly other germline specific functions a lotus domain is also present in the oskar protein a critical component of the pole plasm in the drosophila oocyte which is required for germ_cell formation lotus domains are found in various proteins from metazoans and plants are often associated with rna specific modules and are likely to adopt a winged_helix fold this suggests a germline specific role in the mrna_localization and or translation or a specific function toward pirnas the tudor domain the name of which originates from its identification in the drosophila tudor protein is a small domain belonging to the large royal family that also includes chromo mbt pwwp and plant agenet domains tudor domains are specialized in the specific recognition of methylated lysine or methylated arginine sites and are involved in various epigenetic functions such as chromatin_remodeling and rna_processing based on their sequences and functions four groups of tudor domains were recently distinguished the first group including the jmdj family of histone demethylases as well as the related bp and crb proteins participates in the histone code deciphering as their tandems of tudor domains bind methylated to whom correspondence should be addressed lysines of histone_tails binding of symmetrically dimethylated arginines sdmas is a property shared by the two following groups that include proteins involved in the rna_metabolism the second group includes the tudor domain of the smn protein the product of the survival of motor_neuron gene which interacts with the spliceosomal sm proteins and regulates the mrna_splicing machinery the third group typified by the tudor domain of snd also called tudorsn or p a component of the rna_induced is involved in the processing of small_non the fourth group contrasts with the others that include widely_expressed proteins it contains proteins highly_enriched or selectively_expressed in germ_cells and involved in the formation of polar germinal granules or nuage those electron_dense organelles abundant in rna and proteins and characteristic of the germline in many organisms these proteins are crucial for spermatogenesis and small_rna pathways several recent_studies showed that the tudor domains of proteins of this group called the germline tudor proteins bind sdmas present on the germ_cell specific piwi proteins these last proteins form a particular clade of argonaute_proteins interacting with a specific class of non_coding piwi_interacting pirnas pirnaspiwi complexes are likely to have diverse roles in the germline they function in gene_silencing probably through a mechanism analogous to rna_interference by inducing the cleavage of gene_transcripts transposon silencing or directly at the transcriptional level moreover they were shown in drosophila to regulate mrna_stability and translation a function which thereby contrasts with the only negative effect of small_interfering sirnas and micro_rnas mirnas arginine methylation of piwis and interaction with tudors seems to be a conserved feature of the piwi pathway that distinguishes it from the somatic ago pathway the other clade of argonaute_proteins that bind to mirnas and small_interfering sirna and are ubiquitously_expressed thus this specific interaction could be required for piwi recruitment to nuage granules and germline tudor proteins might provide the platform necessary for assembly of numerous proteins that function as a complex in the piwi pathway this pathway is essential in drosophila for germ_cell determination and maintenance of germline stem_cells and in mice for postnatal spermatogenesis examination of the sequences of various members of the germline tudor proteins called tdrds shows that globular region s are present upstream of the repeated tudor domains of note in the tdrd and tdrd proteins a long stretch of amino_acids is present at the extreme n terminus and should include globular_domain s as predicted from the analysis of hca plots see_supplementary indeed this region includes fragments containing approximately one third of strong hydrophobic amino_acids gathered into clusters typical of regular secondary_structures however it does not match any known profiles in the domain databases clear hinge regions can be predicted on these plots corresponding to proline_rich regions and or regions containing less hydrophobic amino_acids arrows in supplementary_material tdrd approximately amino_acids and tdrd approximately amino_acids and and which are far less conserved when comparing the tdrd and tdrd sequences this suggests the presence of three separate globular_domains in tdrd and tdrd see_supplementary tdrd domain amino_acid to approximately or domain amino_acids and domain amino_acids tdrd domain amino_acid to approximately domain amino_acids and domain amino_acids we then performed psi blast_searches against the nr database using the first predicted domain of tdrd as query ending either at amino_acid or amino_acid the first iteration identified similarities of tdrd with the tdrd first domain while subsequent iterations identified with significant e values e similarities with the drosophila oskar protein second iteration e and with various other uncharacterized_proteins several of which possess rna binding_domains e g k homology kh domain containing protein from cryptosporidium muris ninth iteration e multiple copies of this domain were also found in limkain b a human autoantigen whose function and partners have not been reported to date this domain was also found in a hypothetical orphan protein d from caenorhabditis_elegans which apparently does not possess tudor domains but is reported in the string database to be co expressed with the germ_cell expressed r c protein a member of the argonaute family in this way by convergence iteration we collected sequences of proteins possessing this domain called lotus after the name of some representative members limkain oskar and tudor containing proteins and the lotus domain is present in various proteins of metazoans including echinoderms arthropods and nematodes and plants seefor the architecture in domains of main representative members of the lotus family the amino_acid conservation profile of the lotus domain allowed the more precise prediction of its c terminal end defined at amino_acid of human tdrd and amino_acid of human tdrd moreover and interestingly along the psi_blast iterations a triplication of the lotus domain was highlighted in the n terminus of the tdrd and tdrd proteins covering the three domains described above these repeats were further assessed at the d level using hca see_supplementary a more precise analysis of the lotus repeats in these proteins suggests that domains and of tdrd are homologous to domains and of tdrd the third domain of tdrd and the second one of tdrd likely resulting from a later duplication event additional hits were identified by searching the nr database using psi_blast and representative members of the lotus family as queries as well as the second and third lotus domain of the tdrd protein a few borderline similarities e values for example oryza_sativa rssg uniprot q cf orysa or other uncharacterized_proteins from plants were also confirmed through reciprocal psi blast_searches multiple_alignment of the lotus domain was made on the basis of the psi_blast alignments and manually refined with guidance from hca which combines comparison of the primary and secondary_structures supplementary_material additional searches were also performed using this multiple_alignment with hmmsearch and these led to recover a few new but also uncharacterized_proteins e g lrr plafa containing one lotus domain between amino_acids and see page domain_organization of some lotus proteins as deduced from the smart pfam databases and the present study uniprot identifiers are indicated tudor tudor domain rrm rna_recognition ank ankyrin ubq ubiquitin homolog duf pf and duf pf correspond to pfam families with unknown function which have been merged into a unique superfamily in the supfam database pnsf no human domain sharing similarities with the gdsl family of serine esterases lipases is present c terminal to the lotus domain in the oskar protein although not reported in the domain databases supplementary_material for a complete list conserved positions within the alignment are principally occupied by strong hydrophobic amino_acids that should correspond to core forming residues outside these only a few other positions are more conserved occupied by proline or glycine_residues in loops or by an aromatic residue in helix this one might play a role in the interaction of the lotus domain with its patrner s the lotus globular_domain is predicted to contain three main helices to followed by two strands and two additional small strands may be suspected on the basis of the hca plot analysis see and in supplementary_material and two additional hydrophobic clusters which would be important for correct folding are also present at the n_terminal and c terminal limits of the lotus domain n and c e g in the c terminus of human tdrd lotus domain a and b as well in the in the c terminus of drosophila oskar lotus domain see_supplementary however these are not very conserved and the a c cluster is even absent in some sequences as for instance in the limkain b repeats or in the second lotus domain of the uncharacterized protein from pichia sitchensis b lkc fold_recognition programs such as phyre indicate marginal but interesting similarities with several families within the winged_helix superfamily scop a e g with the scpb winged_helix domain whd pdb t s e value these similarities are supported by a perfect correspondence between secondary_structures suggesting that the lotus domain may actually adopt a whd fold also made of three consecutive helices and a small two stranded sheet the additional small strand predicted in the lotus domain may integrate this sheet as observed in the scpb whd see_supplementary of note is that the last helix found in the scpb whds after the two stranded sheet consists of a linker_region that does not directly participate in the whd core see_supplementary the variability or even absence of this helix called a c in some lotus domains is thus consistent with its particular non core forming role in the scpb structure and suggests that helix c may also play a linker role in proteins of the lotus family various mammalian tdrd proteins have been reported to interact with piwi proteins the lotus domain described here is however unique to the tdrd and tdrd proteins although having repeats of tudor domains the other tdrds indeed differ in their extreme n termini which include either mynd domain tdrd kh domains tdrd or helicase domain tdrd tdrd interacts more specifically with miwi through its tudor domains in drosophila aubergine aub and ago two members of the piwi family interact with the tudor protein which has apparently no lotus domain in its n_terminal fragment we however show here that a lotus domain is found in the drosophila oskar protein whose localized activity through mrna_localization and subsequent synthesis in the nuage at the posterior_pole of the oocyte termed germ or pole plasm induces germline formation and correct patterning in the fly embryo the localized oskar protein has a critical function in the biogenesis of polar granules and recruits downstream components of the pole plasm such as vasa and tudor proteins it is interesting to note that while many of the drosophila germplasm components are conserved and play_an in mammalian germ_cell formation as well reviewed in the key factor in drosophila oskar has no known orthologs in any other species the results reported here show that the lotus domain is a conserved feature of the protein_complexes present in the piwi containing page lotus multiple_sequence of lotus domains from various proteins positions where hydrophobicity is conserved which should participate in the protein core_structure are boxed and shaded gray other striking identities involving glycine and proline_residues are boxed predicted secondary_structures are reported up to the alignment note that the helix a c is poorly conserved and does not exist in some of the sequences the star indicates the protein end the protein_sequences are designated by their uniprot identifiers and the limits amino_acid numbers of the lotus domains in these sequences are reported note that the c terminal end of the domain is difficult to predict with accuracy due to the extreme variability in this region the fasta formatted file of this alignment is given in the supplementary_material this figure was drawn using espript http espript ibcp fr germline specific_granules in different organisms lotus domains are indeed present in mice in germline tdrds and in drosophila in the long and short isoforms of oskar that directly interact with the tudor protein in that respect tdrd and or tdrd might represent at least in part the functional homolog of oskar in mammals the exact molecular role of the lotus domain remains to be discovered its occurrence in proteins having domains associated with rna_metabolism rna_recognition and kh domains suggests that it might be involved in a rna_binding function this hypothesis is supported by the presence of several basic_residues as well as fold_recognition programs which indicate that the lotus domain may adopt a whd fold possible rna partners are pirnas brought by the tdrd piwi complexes or the numerous mrna present in the nuage granules the rnabinding function might then be involved in the regulation of mrna_translation and or localization or of a specific function in which pirnas participate the identification of this new domain in the mouse germline tudor proteins tdrd and tdrd and in the drosophila oskar protein should help to understand the function of these proteins in the pirna pathways and germline determination as well as to uncover the function of as yet uncharacterized_proteins in this context
