approximately independent linkage_disequilibrium blocks in human populations we present a method to identify approximately independent blocks of linkage disequi librium in the human_genome these blocks enable automated analysis of multiple genome_wide availability_and code http bitbucket org nygcresearch ldetect data http bit bucket org nygcresearch ldetect data the genome_wide gwas is a commonly used study_design for the identification of genetic_variants that influence complex_traits in this type of study millions of genetic_variants are genotyped on thousands to millions of individuals and each variant is tested to see whether an individuals genotype is predictive of their phenotypes because of linkage_disequilibrium ld in the genome a single genetic_variant with a causal_effect on the phenotype leads to multiple statistical but noncausal associations at nearby variants one initial analysis goal in a gwas is to count the number of independent association_signals in the genome while accounting for ld the most commonly used approach to counting independent single_nucleotide snps that influence a trait is to count peaks of association signalsthis can be done manually when the number of peaks is small e g wellcome_trust case or in a semi_automated way when the number of peaks is larger e g there are also fully_automated methods that use ld patterns estimated from large reference_panels of individuals in some contexts e g when performing identical analysis on multiple gwas with the goal of comparing phenotypes it is useful to define approximately independent ld blocks a priori rather than letting them vary across analyses performed on different phenotypes to define approximately independent ld blocks used non overlapping segments of megabase and pickrell used non overlapping segments of snps the breakpoints of these segments undoubtedly sometimes fall in regions of strong ld thus potentially splitting a single association_signal over two blocks and leading to over counting of the number of associated variants a better approximation could be obtained by considering the empirical patterns of ld in a reference_panel e g in the remainder of this article we present an efficient signal_processing based heuristic for choosing approximate segment boundaries
