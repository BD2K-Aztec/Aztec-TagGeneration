genome_analysis artemis an integrated platform for visualization and analysis of high_throughput sequence_based experimental_data motivation high_throughput hts technologies have made low_cost sequencing of large_numbers of samples commonplace an explosion in the type not just number of sequencing_experiments has also taken place including genome re sequencing population scale variation detection whole transcriptome_sequencing and genome_wide analysis of protein bound nucleic_acids results we present artemis as a tool for integrated visualization and computational_analysis of different types of hts datasets in the context of a reference_genome and its corresponding annotation availability artemis is freely_available under a gpl licence for download for macosx unix and windows at the wellcome_trust sanger institute websites prior to the advent_of hts sequencing_experiments were limited by cost to the study of a single sample or a small number of important samples however the recent_advances in dna_sequencing have made it possible for researchers to quickly and inexpensively sequence very large_numbers of samples and to conduct many new types of sequencing based experiments for example hts has been used to study transmission using a large number of isolates of a methicillin_resistant mrsa on both the global and local_scale it has also been used to show that homologous_recombination has led to serotype switching and vaccine escape in a study of isolates of streptococcus_pneumoniae pmen hts has made it possible to explore population genetic_variation among human populations we are now increasingly using it to enhance our understanding of how genetic_differences affect health and disease the aim of projects such as the uk k http www uk k org is to construct detailed catalogues of genome variations and identify many more low_frequency variants that may be associated with susceptibility to disease and response to pathogens drugs and vaccines these applications of hts require the identification of to whom correspondence should be addressed single_nucleotide snps as well as insertions_and in addition to indels hts can be used to identify large structural_variants such as large_insertions deletions inversions and duplications structural_variations are also likely to make an important contribution to diversity and disease_susceptibility the study of functional_genomics and quantitative gene_expression studies has greatly benefited from rna_seq experiments which have refined our understanding of expression and significantly_improved annotation the sheer size of the datasets from hts experiments requires tools to visualize analyse summarize and interpret these largescale datasets many new algorithms and tools have been developed to efficiently process and analyse the data such as those designed to assemble sequences into a consensus e g velvet abyss map or align short_reads against a reference_sequence e g tophat bowtie bwa or those designed to identify sequence_variations e g samtools gatk however an inspection review and interpretation of the output by an experienced and knowledgeable person is essential to understand the genomic_context of these datasets and can be critical to make connections between sequence_variation and biological_phenomena this of course complements computational_approaches because a visual_examination of the results and underlying data is often the next step in order to confirm a prediction or assess the potential functional effects in a sequence_based experiment a number of new software applications have been developed for browsing visualizing and interpreting large_scale sequencing_datasets several of these have been designed specifically for the visualization of genome_sequence assemblies including eagleview hawkeye and tablet other tools such as lookseq and bamview have been developed specifically to visualize short_read data lookseq is a javascript based web_application that displays data stored in bam_files bamview is an interactive java_application that can visualize large_numbers of read_alignments stored in bam_files however often researchers need to visualize these read_alignments in the context of genome_annotation genome_browsers including integrative genome viewer igv integrated genome_browser igb and genoviewer http www genoviewer com have beenpage artemis traditionally a genome visualization and annotation tool has recently been extended and enhanced with a wealth of new features and functionality to support the visualization and analysis of hts datasets in the context of the genome_sequence and annotation bamview was originally developed as a stand alone application to visualize read_alignments stored as binary versions of sam sequence_alignment files and known as bam_files bamview was subsequently incorporated into artemis providing the functionality to view these read_alignments in the context of the nucleotide_sequence and genomic_features reads can be displayed in one of five views aimed at emphasizing different aspects of alignments stacked paired stacked strand stacked inferred size and coverage view it is possible to zoom in and view the read_alignments at the nucleotide level reads can be filtered by their mapping quality and or by their sam flags also the panel can be cloned so that separate views can be shown which is useful when comparing multiple strains for example in addition functionality has been added to display the contents of variant_call vcf files vcf files are compressed and indexed with bgzip and tabix respectively alternatively binary vcf bcf can be used which are generated and indexed using bcftools http samtools sourceforge net mpileup shtml variants stored in these files are rendered in the vcf view allowing the user to visually inspect the variant_calls against the reference_sequence and annotation artemis can access the bam and vcf and the associated index files from a local file system or remotely over http and ftp furthermore filtering mechanisms have been added to artemis to allow users to filter variants in real_time the filter can be based on the type of variant e g synonymous non synonymous insertions or on the properties present in the vcf file such as read_depth and mapping quality these variants can also be automatically annotated according to variant type including synonymous snps non synonymous snps insertion deletion and multiple allele in the reference_strain and one of the other strains the gene has independently become a pseudogene in a second strain because of an snp leading to a premature stop_codon as indicated by the circle in the middle of the line and a third strain has a recombination that spans this whole region shown by the increased snp density artemis can be used for the initial data exploration of hts datasets cross checking of results and for small to medium_size genomes it provides a limited set of analyses this includes calculation of snp density read_counts and the reads per kilobase per_million rpkm for selected genes the read_count results can be saved in a tab_delimited format file these results can be used as input to deseq for example for additional differential_expression finally to display other experimental_datasets e g microarray rna_seq it now has support for user_defined input types which can be rendered graphically as either graphs or heat maps in the following sections we describe these new features in more detail and outline how artemis can be used in several different hts experiments as a platform for interrogating analysing and interpreting these data in this article we have described artemis an integrated genome visualization and analysis platform for hts datasets we have presented several example datasets and discussed the role of artemis in their visualization and interpretation further examples are available on the artemis website_http www sanger ac uk resources software artemis ngs artemis has support for various standard file_formats including bam and vcf in addition to user_defined input_files these formats can support data from many different types of sequencing_platforms therefore artemis has the potential to visualize and investigate sequencing_data from numerous sequencing_technologies the new views available within artemis are easily customizable by the user and can be viewed at different levels of resolution multiple bams and vcfs can be loaded simultaneously for comparison this allows in depth preliminary_analysis and investigations of hts datasets in the context of the sequence and annotation of a reference to reveal biologically relevant_information using indexed files bam vcf bcf and fasta means that artemis can efficiently manage memory by only needing to load into memory the data that is currently being displayed in the interface this improves the performance and enables large_genomes to be viewed and interpreted along with large hts datasets
