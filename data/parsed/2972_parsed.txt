genetic and population analysis minimac faster genotype_imputation genotype_imputation is a key_step in the analysis of genome_wide upcoming very large reference_panels such as those from the genomes_project and the haplotype consortium will improve imputation quality of rare and less common_variants but will also increase the computational_burden here we demonstrate how the application of software engineering techniques can help to keep imputation broadly accessible overall these improvements speed up imputation by an order of magnitude compared with our previous implementation availability_and minimac including source_code documentation and examples is available atgenotype imputation is routinely used to increase the power of genome_wide gwas the approach works by finding haplotype segments that are shared between study individuals which are typically genotyped on a commercial array with snps and a reference_panel of more densely typed individuals such as those studied by the genomes_project in this way the approach can accurately assign genotypes at markers that have not been directly examined facilitating comparison of results across samples genotyped using different marker panels and easing fine_mapping efforts to reduce the computational_burden of this procedure we introduced an approach_called pre phasing in brief this approach works in two steps first haplotypes are estimated for each of the gwas individuals second the estimated haplotypes are used for imputation this two step approach reduces the computational_cost of imputation in two ways first the gwas samples can be decomposed into haplotypes once and these haplotypes can then be re used many times with standard methods likely haplotypes for each sample are estimated every time imputation is repeated with a new or updated reference_panel second because we restrict searches for matching haplotypes to the most likely haplotype for each sample or a small set of likely haplotype configurations comparisons between study samples and reference_panels proceed much faster previous implementations accounted for haplotype uncertainty and sought a pair of matching haplotypes a process for which computation costs increase quadratically with sample_size ongoing whole_genome studies will contribute to reference_panels much larger than currently available based on our computer simulations we expect substantial gains in imputation_accuracy measured as the r between imputed genotypes and the true simulated genotypes and in association information which increases with imputation_accuracy using these panels this is particularly pertinent for rare_variants for which imputation based on current panels which typically have samples is relatively poor since the complexity of imputation increases linearly with the number of markers and individuals in the reference_panel further improvements in computational_efficiency are needed to keep imputation broadly accessible here we describe and evaluate a collection of improvements that speed up imputation by fold while maintaining the accuracy of our current method we compare the running_times of our well established pre phasing method minimac with its tuned version minimac compared with impute and beagle minimac is and respectively faster and requires less memory gb compared with gb for impute and gb for beagle to maximize efficiency of our code we used vector and matrix operation functions from the highly optimized openblas library http www openblas net faster than the standard functions we note that due to overlapping effects the overall speed up is lower than the product of the speed ups measured for each single optimization
