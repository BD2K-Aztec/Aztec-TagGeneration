gene_expression proteostats a library for estimating false_discovery in proteomics pipelines statistical validation of peptide assignments from a large_scale shotgun_proteomics experiment is a critical step and various methods for evaluating significance based on decoy database_search are in practice false_discovery fdr_estimation of peptide assignments assesses global significance and corrects for multiple_comparisons various approaches have been proposed for fdr_estimation but unavailability of standard_tools or libraries leads to development of many in house scripts followed by manual steps that are error_prone and low_throughput the proteostats library provides an open_source framework for developers with many fdr_estimation and visualization features for several popular search algorithms it also provides accurate q values which can be easily integrated in any proteomics pipeline to provide automated accurate high_throughput statistical validation and minimize manual errors availability https sourceforge net_projects mssuite files proteostats high throughout shotgun_proteomics generates millions of spectra that are assigned to peptides by database_searching in an automated manner a scoring_function is used to calculate the level of similarity found between the experimental_spectrum and the theoretical spectrum from a peptide this quantitative value known as the score may be a probability an expectation value or a simple score owing to random matching of peaks in a peptide spectral match psm there is a fuzzy boundary between true and false matches leading to sensitivity versus specificity trade_off at any chosen threshold score conventional metrics like p value e value are intended for significance assessment of a single hit or psm but are not suitable for global significance assessment in large_scale datasets a multiple_testing procedure known as false_discovery fdr is applied to the results for controlling the false_positives globally target_decoy td search based fdr_estimation is used as a standard method for global significance assessment several challenges can arise in i dealing with multiple nonstandard file_formats ii presence of correct peptides in decoy results which should be removed prior to fdr calculation and iii q value calculation leucine isoleucine cannot be distinguished by collision_induced resulting in identical scores for both target and decoy peptides such peptides need to be removed from decoy hits this is a non trivial exercise if carried_out manually but critical for accurate estimation of fdr because even one such peptide may penalize hundreds of matches in target_database the calculation can be tedious for large_datasets and numerous files fdr_estimation has recently been a major field of research in statistical proteomics and several methods and their refined variants have been proposed unfortunately not as many tools are available as there are fdr_estimation methods most methods involve custom in house scripts that may not implement all nuances of the algorithm and thus lack provenance custom pipelines only include the most popular_methods like concatenated or separate methods even though the refined methods improve the results fdranalysis provides fdr for three algorithms but only provides fdr for concatenated search the barrier to their widespread_adoption is the lack of software this may also lead to different implementations of same method code duplication and a considerable waste of research_effort
