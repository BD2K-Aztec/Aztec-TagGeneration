multilevel biological_characterization of exomic variants at the protein level significantly_improves the identification of their deleterious_effects downloaded from motivation there are now many predictors capable of identifying the likely phenotypic_effects of single_nucleotide snvs or short in frame insertions_or indels on the increasing amount of genome sequence_data most of these predictors focus on snvs and use a combination of features related to sequence_conservation biophysical and or structural_properties to link the observed variant to either neutral or disease phenotype despite notable successes the mapping between genetic_variants and their phenotypic_effects is riddled with levels of complexity that are not yet fully understood and that are often not taken into account in the predictions despite their promise of significantly improving the prediction of deleterious mutants results we present deogen a novel variant effect predictor that can handle both missense snvs and in frame indels by integrating information from different biological scales and mimicking the complex_mixture of effects that lead from the variant to the phenotype we obtain significant improvements in the variant effect prediction results next to the typical variant oriented features based on the evolutionary_conservation of the mutated positions we added a collection of protein oriented features that are based on functional_aspects of the gene affected we cross_validated deogen on polymorphisms deleterious snvs and indels from swissprot the multilevel contextualization of each variant protein pair in deogen provides a improvement of mcc with respect to current state of the art tools availability_and the software and the data presented here is publicly_available atthe human exome covers of the entire_genome and contains roughly protein coding_exons there are currently million human variants identified by genome_sequencing over multiple_individuals from different genetic_backgrounds with every individual carrying around four million variants in their whole_genome whole_exome wes identifies approximately of these per individual in a cost effective_manner and has led to the successful identification of many new diseasegene associations in the last years the huge amount of wes data that became available over the last decade has allowed researchers to explore the genetic_basis of human disease and tools were developed that aid in the identification of disease_causing genetic_variants for example variant prioritization_tools process exome_sequencing and rank the observed variants so that the ones most likely to be causative for a specific disease are ranked highest the major benefit of this ranking is that it focuses subsequent in vitro validation experiments to the subset of genetic candidates that are more likely to be related to the disease under investigation the state of the art variant_prioritization methods integrate heterogeneous sources of genetic and biological_information where one of the most critical features are the scores of pathogenicity for single_nucleotide snvs as predicted by tools such as polyphen sift mutationtaster mutation assessor phylop gerp and cadd these tools use machine_learning ml approaches to address the variant effect prediction_problem from many different angles related to the known proxies for pathogenicity such as the evolutionary_conservation of the mutated position the stability change upon mutation possible structural_alterations the change in physico_chemical characteristics due to the mutation and functional_annotations using go terms the phenotypical interpretation of protein level alterations on the level of individuals is the ultimate_goal of this field but this causal_relationship is still far from being completely_understood and it is confounded by many aspects related to the intrinsic complexity of cell life a crucial restriction of variant effect prediction is that an alteration of the proteins molecular phenotype even if it is a sine_qua condition for the disease phenotype in the carrier individual may not constitute in itself a sufficient cause for the disease this also depends on the particular role that the affected protein plays in the well being of the organism even the most commonly used features which relate evolutionary_constraints with likely functional damage offer only a partial_correlation with the pathogenicity of the variant consequently additional information that bridges the variant phenotype gap is crucial to improve variant effect predictions here we present deogen a novel method for variant effect prediction that integrates heterogeneous sources of information in order to analyze each protein variant pair by combining different levels of contextualisation of the protein_function with a random_forest rf predictor after a cross_validation with very strict settings deogen performs better than the most recently_developed variant effect predictors that target missense snvs additionally we show that our approach is general enough to provide an improvement in the prediction of the phenotypic_effects of short in frame genetic_variants indels where after retraining the rf using almost the same features as for snvs deogen performs better than variant effect predictors without multilevel contextualization these improvements show that adding levels of contextualization to variant effect prediction helps to approach the complexity of cell life an effect observed for both snvs and indels the increased contextualization will also in time allow a better understanding of why particular variants might have a particular deleterious_effect the novel variant effect predictor we present here integrates heterogeneous sources of biological_information in order to improve the contextualization of both the variant and the affected protein we do this by merging relevant aspects to the molecular phenotype the gene and the biological_pathways involved we also show that this approach is general enough to be applicable to both snvs and indels even if in the latter case the average impact at the molecular levels is much more disruptive this functional contextualization of the protein enables deogen to outperform nine state of the art predictors indicating that careful integration of data from relevant sources is an excellent approach to improve not only predictions but also our understanding of the mechanisms_underlying the genotype to phenotype relationship future_developments will dig deeper into the interpretation of the single predictions aiming at understanding how a particular variant influences cell machinery and its functioning indvar
