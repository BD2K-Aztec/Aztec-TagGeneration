databases_and drugmap central an on line query and visualization_tool to facilitate drug_repositioning studies systematic studies of drug_repositioning require the integration of multi level drug data including basic chemical_information such as smiles drug_targets target related signaling_pathways clinical_trial information and food_and fda_approval information to predict new potential indications of existing_drugs currently available databases however lack query support for multi level drug information and thus are not designed to support drug_repositioning studies drugmap central dmc an online tool is developed to help fill the gap dmc enables the users to integrate query visualize interrogate and download multi level data of known drugs or compounds quickly for drug_repositioning studies all within one system availability dmc is accessible at http r d drug org dmc aspx drug_repositioning has emerged as a cost_effective and timeefficient strategy to find new indications for old drugs because development of a new drug is time consuming years expensive billion and has a low success_rate between and researchers are applying more systematic approaches to address new treatment opportunities by using the available multi level data and information of known drugs including their chemical_structures targets target related signaling_pathways clinical_trial information and fda_approval information several available databases have been developed for the aim of supporting drug_repositioning research including pharmdb http pharmdb org promiscuous von and drugpredict however clinical_trial and fda_approval information as well as signaling pathway_information are often missing from these available drug_repositioning databases it is inconvenient and time consuming for researchers without any pharmacological background to interrogate and assimilate these multi level drug data distributed across different data_sources for drug_repositioning studies moreover these data often do not share consistent entry names when a specific biological_question is asked e g which drugs that are not in clinical_trial phase_ii or later phases target on the her pathway the researcher has to go to different databases to check the data of clinical_trials targets and pathways in this article we present a united data source drugmap central dmc with online visualization interfaces to query and search the integrated drug data quickly furthermore dmc integrates the standardized disease information from mesh http www nlm nih gov mesh into clinical_trial and fda_approval information to facilitate checking known disease information of drugs or compounds for drug_repositioning studies the unique multi level drug data with visualization interfaces are available at http r d drug org dmc aspx with testing demos
