gregor evaluating global enrichment of trait associated variants in epigenomic features using a systematic data_driven approach_motivation the majority of variation identified by genome_wide falls in non coding genomic_regions and is hypothesized to impact regulatory_elements that modulate gene_expression here we present a statistically_rigorous software_tool gregor genomic regulatory_elements and gwas overlap algorithm for evaluating enrichment of any set of genetic_variants with any set of regulatory_features using variants from five phenotypes we describe a data_driven approach to determine the tissue and cell_types most relevant to a trait of interest and to identify the subset of regulatory_features likely impacted by these variants last we experimentally evaluate six predicted functional_variants at six lipid associated loci and demonstrate significant evidence for allele specific impact on expression levels gregor systematically evaluates enrichment of genetic_variation with the vast collection of regulatory data available to explore novel biological_mechanisms of disease and guide us toward the functional_variant at trait associated loci availability_and gregor including source_code documentation examples and executables is available atthe list of common_genetic associated with complex disease continues to grow as a result of increasingly powered genome_wide gwas a large proportion of the associated variants are non coding and it has proven difficult to identify the functional_variant at loci with many variants in tight linkage_disequilibrium ld in addition these loci often account for only a small percentage of the trait heritability which makes any minor alteration of transcript_levels difficult to detect although eqtls in relevant tissues can highlight loci where variants likely impact transcription of nearby genes fine_mapping of the causal_variant is plagued by the same ld patterns that impact disease_association common variation located outside of proteincoding regions modulates regulatory_elements in a cell_type specific_manner examining disease associated variants in relation to genomic_regions of functional_importance can give insight into the molecular_mechanisms leading to disease_phenotypes particularly when all associated variants are considered in aggregate our understanding of the location of regulatory_elements in the genome has expanded with the advent of chromatin_immunoprecipitation followed by high_throughput chip_seq however it is challenging to untangle meaningful biological understanding in a systematic manner given the diverse set of data available from hundreds of cell_types and tissues with the notion that non coding genetic_variation plays a role in transcriptional_regulation via regulatory epigenomic features we can harness these data to gain knowledge of important biological_mechanisms for example genetic_variation that impacts local chromatin or methylation states and dna accessibility can impact transcription in a given cell in a majority of associated genomic_regions the snp supported by encode data is a snp in strong ld with the top reported gwas snp systematic chromatin profiling has revealed that variants linked with the gwas index variant defined here as the most strongly associated variant are often positioned within enhancer_elements active in relevant cell_types furthermore the overlap of particular histone_methylation marks with trait associated variants is cell_type suggesting that gene_regulation is influenced by trait alleles in a cell_type specific_manner however these methods often do not consider an appropriate control set for evaluating enrichment and do not always carefully evaluate the most relevant tissues or cell_types for enrichment of trait specific variation identifying causal_variants and mechanisms at gwas loci remains a universal scientific challenge with this motivation we developed a statistically_rigorous approach to quantify enrichment of trait associated variants in experimentally annotated functional_elements such as open chromatin_states histone_marks and protein binding_sites in relevant cell_types to develop a clearer understanding of the underlying regulatory_mechanisms we apply an algorithm and systematic scientific_method for prioritizing functional candidate variants at genomewide significant trait associated loci our aims are threefold i to elucidate the important tissue cell_types in which genetic_variation impacts transcription for a particular trait ii to narrow our focus of the regulatory_features underlying transcription disrupted by trait associated variants and iii to use positional overlap with selected regulatory domains to identify potential functional candidates at trait associated loci to address these aims we evaluate genetic_variation identified by gwas for five metabolic phenotypes blood_pressure c newton cheh and p munroe unpublished_data

evaluating enrichment as a method to query the vast_array of encode data for the design of functional experiments enabling scientists with non computational backgrounds to prioritize variants and loci
