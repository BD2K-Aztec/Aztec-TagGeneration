spotcaliper fast wavelet_based spot detection with accurate size estimation motivation spotcaliper is a novel wavelet_based image_analysis providing a fast automatic_detection scheme for circular patterns spots combined with the precise estimation of their size it is implemented as an imagej plugin with a friendly user_interface the user is allowed to edit the results by modifying the measurements in a semi_automated way extract data for further analysis the fine_tuning of the detections includes the possibility of adjusting or removing the original detections as well as adding further spots results the main advantage of the software is its ability to capture the size of spots in a fast and accurate way availability_and the focus of our article is the analysis of circular objects spots since their detection and size estimation is fundamental in the image_processing of micrographs our method software can be applied to a broad class of images it is not linked to one specific biological problem however we note two particular applications where the precise detection of the spots and their radius estimation is of high interest first in antimicrobial_susceptibility of significant bacterial_isolates the size of the zones of the inhibition areas are measured and used as an indicator of antibiotics resistance susceptible intermediate or resistant second detection and size measurements are also important for understanding elispot images
