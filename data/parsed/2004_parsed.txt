genome_analysis genome_annotation test with validation on transcription_start and chip_seq for pol_ii binding data motivation many chip_seq are aimed at developing gold_standards for determining the locations of various genomic_features such as transcription start or transcription_factor on the whole_genome many such pioneering experiments lack rigorous testing methods and adequate gold_standard annotations to compare against as they themselves are the most reliable source of empirical data available to overcome this problem we propose a self consistency test whereby a dataset is tested against itself it relies on a supervised machine learning_style protocol for in silico annotation of a genome and accuracy estimation to guarantee at least self consistency results the main results use a novel performance metric a calibrated precision in order to assess and compare the robustness of the proposed supervised_learning method across different test_sets as a proof_of we applied the whole protocol to two recent chip_seq encode datasets of stat and pol_ii binding_sites stat is benchmarked against in silico detection of binding_sites using available position_weight pol_ii the main focus of this paper is benchmarked against algorithms for the closely_related and well studied problem of in silico transcription_start tss prediction our results also demonstrate the feasibility of in silico genome_annotation extension with encouraging_results from a small portion of annotated genome to the remainder availability available from http www genomics the recent_advances in microarray_technologies tiling arrays snp_arrays etc and more recently in high_throughput next_generation ngs allows for more complete genome_wide annotation of functional sites the rapid increase in the data_volumes has put pressure on the development of data analysis techniques capable of coping with large volumes of data that can reliably extract relevant knowledge this article analyses and benchmarks techniques introduced inbased on supervised_learning and the generalization capabilities of predictive_models that are trained on part of the genome and tested to whom correspondence should be addressed on the remainder our approach consists of dividing the genome into small tiles and then allocating a binary label to each tile according to the observed phenomenon e g the presence of a transcription_factor within the tile a model is then trained on a portion of the genome to predict the labels from the dna_content of tiles and then tested on the whole_genome the prediction_accuracy is then used to assess the properties of the assay there are many interesting phenomena which can be analysed by this approach and we will now focus on two key examples a quality test for chip_seq experiment we first discuss a quality test for chip_seq when there is no independent gold_standard to assess the final results in the paper by we compared a few sets of putative peaks for stat and pol_ii binding_sites generated by various analysis methods applied to the chipseq experimental_data of as the gold_standards provided by the encode_project were extracted from the same experimental_data and their putative peaks were a part of our comparative_study an independent and objective way of evaluating the various lists of peaks was required introduced a consistency benchmark for each list of putative peaks ordered by the allocated p values a model was trained using only chromosome to predict the overlap of a tile with a peak from the tiles dna_content the model was then applied to the whole_genome and its predictions compared with the list of putative peaks the lists and the peak_calling algorithms generating them that provided more consistent accurate_predictions deemed to be more accurate significant differences in the peak_calling algorithms were observed the article is linked directly to those methods developed by for both pol_ii and stat but here the focus is mainly on predicting pol_ii an extension of annotation a critical hurdle in the way to full mechanistic interpretation of genetic data is extending the annotation of the human_genome such that every regulatory_sequence in the genome is identified along with known disease associated genetic_variations and changes the analysis of the transcriptome by ngs methods generates novel genomic expression landscapes state specific expression single_nucleotide snps the transcriptional_activity of repeat elements and both known and new alternative_splicing these all have an impact on current models of key signalling_pathways suggesting thatpage in section below we cover the main experiments with detection of pol_ii binding and in silico tss detection in section we outline additional experiments with chip_seq for transcription_factor stat in this article we aimed to demonstrate that chip_seq results can be used to develop robust predictors by training on a small part of the annotated genome and then testing on the remainder primarily for the purpose of cross checking the consistency of the chip_seq results and also for novel genome_annotation as a proof_of we have chosen two encode chip_seq for binding of the transcription_factor stat and the pol_ii complex stat experiments have shown that rsv models are superior in learning global patterns compared with standard pwm based_approaches for pol_ii where pwms are not applicable we have compared against the best of class in silico tss predictors arts as tss is closely_related to pol_ii binding though arts is our focus as a baseline we also benchmarked against other specialized algorithms using the methods of our predictors are created by a generic algorithm and not a tss specific procedure page with customized problem specific input_features for instance we do not take into account the directionality of the strands which may improve performance as such information is not available from empirical chip_seq nevertheless we have demonstrated that the lack of such information does not prevent the development of accurate classifiers on par with dedicated tools such as arts at the bp resolution for our aim of developing a generic and robust technique for genome_annotation arts originally intended for higher bp resolution is too specialized and overly complex indeed arts uses five different sophisticated kernelsi e custom developed techniques for feature_extraction from dna neighbourhood of bp around the site of interest this includes two spectrum kernels comparing the k_mer composition of dna upstream the promoter_region and down stream of the tss the complicated weighted degree kernel to evaluate the neighbouring dna composition and two kernels capturing the spatial dna configuration twisting angles and stacking energies consequently arts is very costly to train and run it takes cpu hours sec to train and scan the whole_genome furthermore for training the labels are very carefully_chosen and cross checked in order to avoid misleading clues sec in contrast our generic approach is intended to be applied to novel and less studied dna properties thus we do not assume the availability of prior_knowledge consequently our model uses only standard and generic genomic_features and all available labelled examples in the training_set it uses only a dimensional merbased vector of frequencies in a single bp tile which is further simplified using feature_selection to dimensions this approach is generic and the training and evaluation is accomplished within cpu hours we stress again that as stated in section for the sake of fairness we have used not only chip_seq trained rsv models but also two different models rsv rfg and rsv ex which are trained using refgene annotations only which were used for training arts however while arts used all refgene annotations available in hg resulting in n k positive and n k negative_examples we have used a much smaller training_set namely the sites residing on chromosome in the case of rsv ex which is by design the closest to the annotation used in the original arts publication this results in only n k positive and n k negative_examples which is more than seven times less than arts training used yet as we see inand the performance of arts and rsv ex tested against refgeneex annotations are virtually equivalent the same equivalent performance was seen testing rsv rfg on our refgene annotation for hg finally note that model interpretation is very feasible as our rsv models are linear_combinations of simple k_mer frequencies this creates the potential for novel insights into the molecular mechanisms_underpinning the phenomena of interest we have not yet explored the utility of model interpretation but consider it an important area for future_research we have found that the roc do not discriminate well between the performance of different predictors with high_precision which inevitably occurs for low recall similar features are shown by the roc_curves infor the high_specificity regions thus roc and auroc are not informative for genomewide scans under highly unbalanced class sizes the same applies to enrichment_scores and consequently kolmogorovsmirnov statistic see the section in supplementary_materials one curious point of note is the sharp_decline in precision that can be observed as recall in this can only be caused by the most confidently predicted samples being negatively labelled one hypothesis is that these are in fact incorrectly labelled true_positives support for this may be that the decline is not observable when using the exon restricted negative_examples in this hypothesis has been confirmed by testing for human and mouse against annotations by un clustered cage tags and is the focus of a follow_up paper one of the most intriguing outcomes is the very good performance of the rsv po predictor in the tests on the refgene and refgeneex datasets and also on the benchmark of after all the rsv po was trained on data derived from broad chip_seq peak ranges on chromosome only this chip_seq rozowsky page was derived from hela s cells an immortalized cervical_cancer derived cell_line which differ from normal human cells those peaks should cover most of the tss regions but presumably are also subjected to other confounding phenomena e g pol_ii stalling sites in spite of such confounding information the training algorithm was capable of creating models distilling the positions of the carefully curated and reasonably localized tss sites in refgene this warrants a follow_up investigation which we intend to conduct in the near future
