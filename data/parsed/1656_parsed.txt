description of molecular_interactions in research_articles attracted substantial research interest recently event trigger identification detecting the words describing the event_types is a crucial and prerequisite step in the pipeline process of biomedical event_extraction taking the event_types as classes event trigger identification can be viewed as a classification task for each word in a sentence a trained classifier predicts whether the word corresponds to an event type and which event type based on the context features therefore a well designed feature_set with a good level of discrimination and generalization is crucial for the performance of event trigger identification results in this article we propose a novel framework for event trigger identification in particular we learn biomedical domain_knowledge from a large text corpus built from medline and embed it into word features using neural language modeling the embedded features are then combined with the syntactic and semantic context features using the multiple_kernel method the combined feature_set is used for training the event trigger classifier experimental_results on the golden_standard corpus show that

for the proposed_framework is freely_available and can be downloaded atin molecular_biology molecular_events describe observable alterations of biomolecules such as binding of proteins or rna production these molecular_events influence the formation of a phenotype which may be responsible for drug reactions or development of certain diseases however knowledge about these events is scattered in the scientific_literature with continuing fast growth tremendous systematic and automated efforts are required to use the underlying information as such biomedical event_extraction attracted much research interest recently several evaluation tasks such as bionlp bionlp and bionlp shared tasks have been held in recent_years to allow researchers to develop and compare their methods for biomedical events extraction in general each biomedical event consists of a trigger and one or more arguments for example inhibiting tyrosine_phosphorylation of stat describes two events one is the phosphorylation event and the other is the negative regulation event which is signaled by the word inhibiting and takes the first phosphorylation event as its argument in a typical biomedical event annotation these two events are represented as follows e event type phosphorylation theme stat toloc tyrosine e event type negative regulation inhibiting theme e biomedical event_extraction aims to extract such event information from biomedical_literature and reformats this extracted information in structures as represented by the two annotations presented above by extracting detailed behaviors of biomolecules biomedical event_extraction can be used to support the development of biomedical related databases to extract events from texts most systems rely on a pipeline procedure which usually consists of three cascaded modules including biomedical term identification event trigger identification and event argument detection in such pipeline based_approaches it is crucial to identify event triggers reliably as errors in an early_stage will be propagated and hurt the performance of the subsequent module analysis on the event_extraction results show that of extraction errors are attributed to the errors of event trigger identification to achieve a better performance existing_approaches to event trigger identification are mostly based on learning classifiers from annotated data instead of using manually constructed dictionaries containing a list of trigger words or manually defined linguistic rules in such approaches event_types are treated as classes and the aim is to classify words in sentences as indicating a particular event type or not by taking the context features including the syntactic and semantic features into account to whom correspondence should be addressed however such approaches rely on abundant annotated training data and may not work well when certain event instances are rare in the training data for example the word proteolysis does not occur as an event trigger for catabolism type in the training data of the multi level event_extraction mlee corpus therefore it is difficult to recognize it as an event trigger in the sentence the effects of igf are mediated principally through the igf r but are modulated by complex interactions with multiple igf_binding that themselves are regulated by phosphorylation proteolysis polymerization and cell or matrix association which appears in the test_set nevertheless we notice that another word hydrolysis was annotated as an event trigger in the training data as shown in if we search through medline http www ncbi nlm nih gov entrez query static overview html we can find that the two words proteolysis and hydrolysis occur in similar context thus tend to have similar meanings following the distributional hypothesis examples of the similar context where proteolysis and hydrolysis occur in medline are presented in if we can learn such domain_knowledge and incorporate it into trigger word identification then proteolysis might be correctly_identified as an event trigger even if it did not appear in the training data at all in this article we argue that biomedical domain_knowledge such as words tends to occur in similar context is highly related and this can be incorporated into the learning_process of the event trigger classifier to improve the performance of trigger word identification in specific we propose a novel framework to learn biomedical knowledge from a large text corpus built from medline and embed it into word features using neural language modeling the embedded features are further combined with the well designed syntactic and semantic context features using the multiple_kernel mkl method for classifier training we conducted extensive experiments on the mlee corpus and the results show that improvement on f score is achieved using the proposed_framework when compared with the state of the art approach demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed_framework the rest of the article is organized as follows section_presents the proposed_framework which consists of three steps domain_knowledge embedding local_context features extraction and mkl experimental_setup and results are discussed in section finally section concludes the article
