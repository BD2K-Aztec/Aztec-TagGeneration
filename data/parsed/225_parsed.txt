a logical model of hiv interactions with the t cell activation signalling_pathway motivation human_immunodeficiency hiv hijacks host cellular_processes to repli cate within its host through interactions with host_proteins it perturbs and interrupts signaling_pathways that alter key_cellular although networks of viralhost interactions have been relatively well characterized the dynamics of the perturbation process is poorly_understood dynamic_models of infection have the potential to provide insights into the hiv host_interaction results we employed a logical signal flow network to model the dynamic interactions between hiv proteins and key human signal_transduction necessary for activation of cd t lymphocytes we integrated viralhost interaction and host signal_transduction data into a dynamic logical model comprised of nodes hiv and human proteins and interactions collected from the hiv human interaction_database the model reproduced expected patterns of t cell activation co stimulation and co inhibition after simulations we identified host_cell including mapk ikkb ikky ikka and pka which contribute to the net activation or inhibition of viral_proteins through in silico knockouts the model identified a further nine host_cell including members of the pi k signalling_pathway that are essential to viral_replication simulation_results intersected with the findings of three sirna gene_knockout studies and identified potential_drug our results demonstrate how viral_infection causes the cell to lose control of its signalling system logical boolean modelling therefore provides a useful approach for analysing the dynamics of hostviral interactions with potential applications for drug_discovery human_immunodeficiency hiv is the pathogenic agent responsible for acquired_immune hiv cannot replicate on its own requiring host cellular_machinery to reproduce the virus accomplishes this by interacting with its host via thousands of highly_specific molecular_interactions these interactions constitute a complex network that drives cellular_functions to viral favourable_conditions and cause a host response to infection altering the normal cellular functioning of the host system the hiv host_cell factor interaction_network is complicated with numerous direct and indirect interactions involving viralviral factors viralhost cell factors and hosthost cell factor interactions in the exploited host cellular_systems a primary goal of hiv research is to obtain a detailed and coherent understanding of infection and viral_replication critical to this goal is an understanding of viralhost interactions the hosts immune_response and anti_viral mechanisms that play_key combating infection this network of interactions may provide_valuable the development of treatment regimes and the identification of novel drug_targets extensive hiv human protein interaction data have been collated in the hiv computational modelling techniques have been employed to create static hiv interaction networks but these have not usually considered spatial and temporal aspects static models provide useful information on basic topological_properties of hiv host interactions for instance vanconstructed an hiv human protein_interaction using hiv host proteinprotein_interactions contained in hhid and reported that depending on the cellular_process being perturbed viral_proteins interact both directly and indirectly with hiv dependency factors hdfs therefore studying the hdf network has the potential to improve our understanding of hivhost interactions however the cell is in a dynamic_state external and internal signals influence protein interactions and hence cellular_functions as a consequence of these signals different cellular_processes are halted or activated processes may become active only under certain conditions or in a particular cell_type static networks alone do not account for such complexities in a dynamic system the effect of specific signals on its function can be determined construction of dynamic_models of virushost interactions will therefore improve our understanding of the viral hijack of the host_cells signal_transduction network signalling_pathway networks can explain the dynamic flow of signals between molecules in a cell these networks not only represent the proteins and interactions involved but they also show the direction of signal flow an application of computer modelling techniques to understanding cellular interaction dynamics is the logical boolean model formalism logical boolean models are qualitative signal flow networks that provide a means to dynamically represent complex_networks lacking in kinetic details and quantitative data they reveal functional dependencies and non linear relationships between components of the system represent its dynamic_response following from input signals and perturbations and predict end states which the system is likely to reach either as steady_states or attractor cycles the logical model can also be used to determine properties such as dependencies feedback_loops robustness and sensitivity logical boolean models find applications in many biological_phenomena for example they have been used to reproduce knockout and overexpression profiles of mutant_mice and to predict that the overexpression of src results in increased endocytosis of egfr in the absence low amount of the epidermal_growth in human_mammary of all immune_cells cd t lymphocytes are the most important cell_type involved in hiv_infection hiv enters into these cells via the interaction of its envelope_proteins with the cd receptor and cxcr or ccr co receptors besides viral_entry hiv s interaction with these receptors can trigger signals that activate multiple signalling_pathways stimulating cellular_processes within the host_cell in this study we have computationally analysed signalling_pathways essential for t cell activation through the t cell receptor complex tcr its co stimulators and its co inhibitors since chemokines apart from inducing chemotaxis also amplify t cell activation_signals we have included chemokine signalling_pathways we thus present the first integrated logical model of hiv interactions with t cell activation pathways by plotting the interdependencies between host and viral_proteins we identify host_proteins that inhibit or activate hiv proteins in these pathways by simulating loss of functions i e in silico knockouts we determine putative points for potential drug intervention we demonstrate that insights into hiv human protein interactions can be obtained by integrating hhid and other biological data into a modelling framework this approach will be transferable to other pathways we have used logical models as a novel approach to construct hiv network_dynamics because this technique is efficient in the absence of detailed quantitative information pathogenic viral_infections and cancer have been traced to malfunctioning signalling_pathways that induce disrupted cellular_responses to signals and produce a diseased state using logical models the effect of viral protein interactions on downstream cellular_components can be monitored our dependency results have predicted that hiv interactions with proteins in these signalling_pathways reduce the dependence of the host_proteins on upstream hcfs in the signalling_pathway for their activation or deactivation while ensuring that the pathways remain activated we suggest that hiv has evolved to disrupt the normal checks and balances that regulate each pathway thereby favouring processes that enable its replication the possibility of bypassing a stage in the pathway involving host_cells interacting with hiv has also been observed in our model with pka as an example the dependency matrix provides a way to analyse the effect of viral interactions on the host system our model has reproduced experimental viral host protein interaction effects and gives an added advantage of permitting comparison of the effect of viral_proteins on all host_proteins in the pathway with their consequences for other host host protein interactions our approach has also predicted global interactions not reported in the hhid e g pak and nck activating vpr hiv host dependency results have suggested that positive feedback_loops exist between interacting pairs tat gsk and tat map k nik the feedback_loop tat gsk is recorded in hhid and verifies the interaction in the database not only do dependency matrices predict dependencies they also predict the influence of viral_proteins on host molecules supplementaryshows the influence of viral_proteins on host molecules one of the host molecules in the influence table adrbk was also identified by sirna gene_knockout study by in the combined dependency and influence table supplementary the hiv t cell dependency made global predictions two of these are found in hhid this highlights the predictive_power of logical models dependency matrices also allow us to exclude or include interactions in analysis based on differences due to cell_type or stage of infection with given cell_type or infection stage information dependency matrix results could be used to correct false positives_and that are recorded in the hhid logical steady_state analysis provides a way to simulate the changes in signal_transduction due to mutations or external_stimuli like drug_actions in our model under controlled conditions we discover that viralhost interactions activate proteins in the model that are normally switched off in signal_transduction in addition to the known behaviour that viral invasion of the host_cell triggers in the immune system our results indicate that as a consequence of infection the normal checks and balances in signal_transduction are bypassed facilitating viral_infection the identification of these proteins is important as they represent fixed or immutable targets for antiviral therapeutics known drug_targets among our lss results are mapk_erk pka pdpk pi k and pkcb d lss analysis therefore provides an avenue to identify potential_drug for experimental_validation and would be very useful in further in silico pathogenic studies our results suggest that viralhost interactions do contribute to the activation of more host_proteins and hence aid activation of processes downstream of these proteins it also suggests that the virus does not in any way impede these signals but instead amplifies them in conclusion we have demonstrated that insights into hiv human protein interactions can be obtained by integrating direct hhid interactions and other biological data into a logical modelling framework it is yet unclear how infection_dynamics will change in cd t cell_signalling when other pathways are included therefore hiv host infection models need to be constructed on a larger scale to encompass all pathways and cell_types involved in hiv_infection this modelling framework could also be used to elucidate other signalling_pathways to better understand signal flow information and rationally identify potential drug intervention points
