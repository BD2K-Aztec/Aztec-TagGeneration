structural_bioinformatics assist a fast versatile local structural_comparison tool motivation structural_genomics initiatives are increasingly leading to the determination of the d structure of target_proteins whose catalytic_function is not known the aim of this work was that of developing a novel versatile_tool for searching structural_similarity which allows to predict the catalytic_function if any of these proteins results the algorithm implemented by the tool is based on local structural_comparison to find the largest subset of similar residues between an input protein and known functional sites the method uses a geometric hashing approach where information related to residue pairs from the input structures is stored in a hash_table and then is quickly retrieved during the comparison step tests on proteins belonging to different functional_classes done using the catalytic_site atlas entries as targets indicate that the algorithm is able to identify the correct functional class of the input protein in the vast_majority of the cases availability_and the application was developed in java se with a java swing graphic_user gui the system can be run locally on any operating system os equipped with a suitable java virtual_machine and is available at the followingin recent_years the dogma one geneone proteinone function had to be corrected based on the observation that a wealth of proteins thought in the past to carry out a unique specific function show a multifunctional or moonlighting character in addition the flourishing of structural_genomics initiatives is leading to the determination of the d structure of a number of target_proteins whose precise catalytic_function is not known on the other hand the availability of a huge number of enzymes d structures has allowed to code structurefunction relationships in databases among which the catalytic_site atlas csa is the most prominent example the possibility to predict the function of a protein based on its sequence or structure would be of great utility in the aforementioned cases and prediction of proteins functional sites by using sequence_information is a long_sought goal with early_attempts dating back to several years_ago such as the prosite and prints databases potentially similar to known catalytic_sites basically given an input protein p the program tries to find sets of similar structures or alignments between p and a list of known catalytic_sites which can be either functional sites or structural_motifs these alignments are detected by means of geometric and chemical similarity among groups of residues coming from the input protein and from the known sites at different and configurable structural levels side chain backbone or both the execution flow of the system is made up of the following phases a preliminary setup phase where catalytic_sites are retrieved and stored by analyzing the information available online in the csa and the corresponding information from the protein_data a preprocessing phase where the input protein is scanned and its pairs of residues are stored into a hash_table according to their amino_acid types and the distance between their geometric centers this is done via a technique called geometric hashing where information related to the proteins residues taken as pairs is indexed and mapped into a d hash index in terms of a so_called ninetuple which includes the name of the input protein and the name number chain id and geometric center of the residues from the pair therefore each d point of the hash structure will potentially contain a list of nine tuples from the input protein the d hash index thus built is exemplified in an alignment recognition phase where the data_structure created during the previous phase is compared with the known catalytic_sites earlier acquired so that a list of suitable alignments between those sites and the input protein are returned if any and filtered by several criteria minimum score maximum rmsd etc a result display phase where the alignments found are presented to the user who is given a number of options for sorting them analyzing them and graphically displaying them as d models this includes visualization via the jmol program a more detailed_description of the aforementioned phases can be found in the supplementary_materials in this article the development of assist a software_tool to search for local structural_similarities between a protein_structure and a set of structural_motifs has been reported its application to the problem of function recognition has been presented demonstrating that notwithstanding the simplicity of its approach assist correctly_predicts the specific catalytic_function of a given input protein in the vast_majority of the cases analyzed particularly interesting from this point_of is the case of the protein bfr presented in the supplementary_materials which does not share any significant sequence or structure homology with proteins whose function is known in this case the exclusively structure based_approach of assist is able to recognize the local structural_similarity between bfr and the proline specific aminopeptidase active_site even in a different sequence structure context the tests also underlined the limits of assist when coupled to the current csa in which for each enzyme only residues directly involved in the catalytic_reaction are present to improve the performance of assist the tool should be used in conjunction with a collection of active_sites in which also substrate_binding residues and cofactors are present a sort of active_site atlas the development of an active_site atlas according to the aforementioned criteria requires careful analysis of the literature related to all the csa entries and as such is a long_term effort currently this work has been undertaken and completed for of all the csa entries finally as reported in the sample usage cases section of the supplementary_materials assist can be readily adapted to other biological_problems involving local structure similarity_searches by simply plugging in different structural_motif databases in the place of the csa
