structural_bioinformatics press protein s sulfenylation server motivation transient s sulfenylation of cysteine thiols mediated_by plays_a in pathology physiology and cell_signaling therefore discovery of new s sulfeny lated sites in proteins is of great_importance towards understanding how protein_function is regulated upon redox_conditions results we developed press protein s sulfenylation web_server a server which can effectively predict the cysteine thiols of a protein that could undergo s sulfenylation under redox_conditions we envisage that this server will boost and facilitate the discovery of new and currently unknown_functions of proteins triggered upon redox_conditions signal regulation and transduction thus uncovering the role of s sulfenylation in human_health and disease availability_and the press web_server is freely_available press sulfenylaprotein s sulfenylation is a transient post_translational through which cysteine cys thiols of proteins are reversibly oxidized to cysteine sulfenic_acids cso an event that modulates their function and activity it has been shown that reactive_oxygen ros mediated s sulfenylation of cysteine thiols is a crucial intermediate_state in a variety of cysteine modifications and acts as a regulatory_mechanism in pathology physiology and cell_signaling the discovery therefore of new s sulfenylated sites in proteins is of great_importance towards understanding how protein_function is regulated upon redox_conditions experimental discovery and identification of new cso in proteins is an expensive intensive and time consuming process although numerous servers exist for the prediction of cysteine modifications such as s nitrosylation s glutathionylation etc structure based prediction of transient s sulfenylation is still elusive herein we developed protein s sulfenylation press a server that predicts rapidly and efficiently cso sites in proteins this is a structure based_methodology that relies on the observation of a high_conservation in the spatial environment of cso sites supplementary section tables s s and figs s s to build press we took advantage of the under utilized information of high_resolution x_ray structures bearing cso sites protein_sequence lying within a window_size of w centered at the cysteine are extracted second the spatial amino_acid neighbors surrounding each cysteine in d space lying within a user_defined radius are extracted the distance between a cysteine and a neighboring amino_acid corresponds to the shortest distance between any pair of their atoms based on their atom coordinates third water_molecules and or metal_ions surrounding each cysteine in d space lying within a user_defined radius are also extracted moreover complementary statistical_information concerning all the available cysteines in the uploaded protein_structures is provided in each of the above three cases in the form of sequence_logos or bar charts supplementary figs s s ii automatic prediction of cysteines in proteins that are prone to undergo transient s sulfenylation via an svm based predictive algorithm supplementary section usage instructions for press can be found in supplementary section
