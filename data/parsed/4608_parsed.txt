systems_biology the infobiotics workbench an integrated in silico modelling platform for systems and synthetic_biology the infobiotics workbench is an integrated software_suite incorporating model specification simulation parameter_optimization and model checking for systems and synthetic_biology a modular model specification allows for straightforward creation of large_scale models containing many compartments and reactions models are simulated either using stochastic_simulation or numerical integration and visualized in time and space model_parameters and structure can be optimized with evolutionary algorithms and model properties calculated using probabilistic_model checking availability source_code for linux mac and windowsa comprehensive and generic framework for modelling biological_systems from the molecular to organismal scales remains a distant prospect as a step towards this we have developed a modelling framework and supporting simulation and analysis software that is general enough to model a diverse range of systems and tailored towards large multi compartment cellular_systems we have used our software to successfully model and address a number of problems in systems and synthetic_biology including abscisic_acid related signal_transduction networks multicellular molecular transport in arabidopsis_thaliana and also in synthetic_biology design
