sequence_analysis nonpareil a redundancy based_approach to assess the level of coverage in metagenomic_datasets motivation determining the fraction of the diversity within a microbial_community sampled and the amount of sequencing required to cover the total diversity represent challenging issues for metagenomics studies owing to these limitations central ecological questions with respect to the global_distribution of microbes and the functional_diversity of their communities cannot be robustly assessed results we introduce nonpareil a method to estimate and project coverage in metagenomes nonpareil does not rely on high_quality assemblies operational_taxonomic calling or comprehensive reference_databases thus it is broadly_applicable to metagenomic_studies application of nonpareil on available metagenomic_datasets provided estimates on the relative complexity of soil freshwater and human_microbiome communities and suggested that gb of sequencing_data are required for abundance weighted_average coverage of the soil communities analyzed metagenomics have provided important new insights into the diversity dynamics and functional potential of natural microbial_communities during the past_decade but several critical issues remain_unresolved many metagenomic surveys to date have sampled only a small fraction of the total community dna this is particularly the case for soil and sediment communities furthermore the amount of sequencing required to cover the whole community remains_speculative the fraction of the genomes recovered in a sequencing dataset is termed coverage supplementary box s and depends on the sequencing effort applied and the diversity of the community when the coverage of a metagenome is unknown results and conclusions about species_richness the evenness of the corresponding community differences between communities and the extent and importance of rare community_members are limited moreover differences between sequencing_technologies and continuously changing sequence read_lengths make it challenging to establish a universal approach for coverage estimation determining the total number of unique species or operational_taxonomic otus present in a sample is frequently challenging due to the unknown number of non sampled species and requires either complete coverage or knowledge of the species abundance curve which typically remains_elusive the coverage achieved by a dataset can be calculated more efficiently as it does not depend on a priori_knowledge of the species abundance curve and can be directly related to assembly_quality the level of coverage is typically assessed by identifying and counting otus and generating rarefaction curves empirical and analytical_models have also been applied to coverage estimation using read binning if assembly is not limiting or by targeting specific taxa when genome_size and abundance are known however these approaches and their variations require either the use of a reference genome_database or the clustering of reads in contigs or otus the former is severely limited by the shortage of representative genome_sequences from most habitats the latter is limited by the quality of the assemblies especially for highly complex communities and the use of genes that are much more conserved than the genome average to be sufficiently_similar to allow clustering of reads in otus such as the ribosomal_rna these genes however are known to miss important levels of ecological differentiation among closely_related yet distinct otus therefore a method to estimate the coverage of a metagenomic_dataset that is applicable to communities of varied diversity and does not depend on the quality of the assembly and the completeness of reference_databases is highly_desirable here we introduce nonpareil having no match or equal referring to the count of unmatched reads in a dataset a novel method that aims to fulfill this critical gap in contemporary metagenomic research nonpareil examines the degree of overlap among individual sequence_reads of a whole_genome shotgun wgs metagenome to compute the fraction of reads with no match which is used to estimate the abundance weighted_average coverage i e not the arithmetic mean based on all species in the sample but the average when the abundance of species is considered subsequently it fits a projection line to the estimated_values to determine the amount of sequencing required for almost complete diversity coverage the fraction of unmatched to whom correspondence

used to efficiently estimate the coverage of the collection i e the fraction of the collection captured in the subset this observation has been previously applied to metagenomic_datasets to estimate species_richness functional coverage and coverage of gene amplicons based on ribosomal_rna or other individual genes to the best of our knowledge nonpareil is the first method directly applying this concept to the whole_genome level without using reference markers further we propose that nonpareil projection curves serve as a semi_quantitative proxy to the diversity of the communities this feature is explored to rank natural communities in terms of the degree of their diversity nonpareil curves were calculated for short_read simulated metagenomes of various size and diversity levels generated from publicly_available bacterial_genomes nonpareil estimates of the average coverage of each metagenome correlated strongly pearsons r n with the independently calculated coverage values based on the known composition of each metagenome further the amount of sequencing that was required to nearly cover the total diversity predicted by nonpareil abundance weighted_average coverage of for the genomes in the sample corresponded tightly to the actual_values for each metagenome supplementaryand s and supplementary pearsons r the estimated abundanceweighted average coverage may also serve as an indicator for the expected quality of the metagenome_assembly although several factors other than the coverage are critical for assembly our results show that the average coverage provides a lowerbound estimation of the fraction of assembled reads supplementary while the assembly n of samples with coverage below rarely surpasses twice the read_length for illumina datasets supplementary it is important to note that the precision of the algorithm was reduced at values of redundancy lower than and higher than these values approximately correspond to x and x sequencing_depth respectively supplementary because datasets with lower sequencing_depth than x i e too few sequences obtained are strongly influenced by random variability and thereby subject to spurious_results nonpareil estimates are not reliable at this range and such datasets are flagged accordingly in the output of the algorithm conversely datasets with sequencing_depth above maximum saturation x are best assessed by read recruitment mapping as high_quality assemblies should be achievable in these cases
