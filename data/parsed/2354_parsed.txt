bioimage_informatics img net automated network based analysis of imaged phenotypes automated analysis of imaged phenotypes enables fast and reproducible quantification of biologically relevant_features despite recent_developments recordings of complex networked structures such as leaf venation patterns cytoskeletal structures or traffic networks remain challenging to analyze here we illustrate the applicability of img net to automatedly analyze such structures by reconstructing the underlying_network computing relevant network_properties and statistically comparing networks of different types or under different conditions the software can be readily used for analyzing image data of arbitrary d and d network like structures availability_and img net is open_source under the gpl and can be downloaded from http mathbiol mpimp golm mpg de img net where supplementary_information and data_sets for testing are provided biological and man made systems ranging from biochemical_reactions to neural and social_interactions can often be represented as networks with nodes and edges representing the components and their interactions respectively network representations facilitate not only intuitive visualization but also quantitative_studies of the systems structure and dynamics spatial networks constitute an import subclass which includes networks such as leaf venation cellular cytoskeleton and city streets barth elemy while some of these networks like city infrastructure have been well characterized others like biological spatial networks remain_poorly snapshots of spatial networks can be obtained by imaging_technologies the computational challenge is that of extracting the underlying networks from the gathered images in a fast and reliable fashion and of examining the reconstructions to reveal the underlying organizational_principles the existing image based_methods for reconstruction of biological_networks are typically designed for specific types of networks tree like networks for plant root architectures fungal or leaf venation networks or neuronal topology of the human connectome created which contains the values of the network_properties for the analyzed networks and their null_models to allow further analyses and visualizations of the results img net generates standard plots as svg files for each experiment a reconstructed network overlaying the original image data is saved for all analyzed network_properties plots of the resulting time series are generated to facilitate network comparisons for testing img net was used to compare confocal recordings of the actin_cytoskeleton and c of untreated plant cells and cells treated with an actin disrupting drug we find that the actin networks of treated cells display a consistently lower assortativity indicating a drugrelated filament fragmentation further for untreated cells the observed networks display significantly_smaller average path lengths accessibility and significantly_higher algebraic connectivities robustness than expected by chance p values estimated from the null_model via one sample t tests suggesting a biological_basis for the maintenance of short and robust transportation routes we also used img net to analyze the network_structure of the german autobahn which was obtained from openstreetmap as an image by using a gray_scale coding of the speed limits we find that similar to the actin_cytoskeleton the autobahn shows significantly_smaller path lengths and a higher algebraic connectivity than expected by chance
