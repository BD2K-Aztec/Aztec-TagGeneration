structural_bioinformatics pars a web_server for the prediction of protein allosteric and regulatory_sites the regulation of protein activity is a key aspect of life at the molecular level unveiling its details is thus crucial to understanding signalling and metabolic_pathways the most common and powerful mechanism of protein_function regulation is allostery which has been increasingly calling the attention of medicinal chemists due to its potential for the discovery of novel therapeutics in this context pars is a simple and fast method that queries protein dynamics and structural conservation to identify pockets on a protein_structure that may exert a regulatory effect on the binding of a small_molecule ligand availability pars is freely_available as a web_server at http bioinf uab cat pars tight regulation of protein_function is fundamental to life proteins involved in metabolic_pathways signalling_cascades and genomic transcription among other processes within the living_cell are commonly under allosteric_regulation i e their activity is modified through the binding of a ligand molecule to the protein in a site different from the active_site in fact allostery is one of the most powerful protein_function regulation mechanisms as it allows proteins to sense and immediately respond to changes in their environment traditional drug_design approaches focusing on active or primary binding_sites can be therefore extended by exploiting allosteric_sites as shown by current efforts on gpcrs or farnesyl_pyrophosphate synthase an advantage of targeting allosteric_sites therapeutically is a reduced risk of secondary adverse_effects this is because allosteric_sites appear to be significantly less conserved than active_sites across homolog proteins enabling the design of allosteric drugs with high_specificity for a single protein within a family this observation has motivated the development of allosteric drugs for the regulation of phosphodiesterase d for which active_site inhibitors cause emesis a dose limiting side effect moreover a drug_discovery approach based on allosteric_sites may result in the development of not only novel drug like inhibitors but activators as well other concepts such as the notion of serendipitous allosteric_sites which have no known ligand in nature but can become functional in the presence of an opportunistic ligand or the idea that almost any protein may be regulated allosterically contribute to the current interest in the pharmacological exploitation of allosteric_sites in this context it is expected that a deeper_understanding of the properties of allosteric_sites and their identification would help streamlining the design and discovery of novel therapeutic_drugs despite growing efforts the atomic_level details that explain the functional relationship between distant_sites in the same protein molecule have not been elucidated for most of the known cases of allostery this has motivated a growth in the number of computational studies on protein allosteric_sites including the recent_publication of three web_servers spacer and mcpath which study the allosteric communication across residues in a protein_structure and allosite which predicts allosteric_sites on protein_structures using a machine_learning approach here we present pars which queries protein_flexibility and structural conservation to predict the location of allosteric_sites the implementation emphasizes ease of use and speed whereas maintaining high_accuracy as benchmarked against a large set of known allosteric proteins even though our method as the servers mentioned earlier in the text requires a protein_structure to work we have added an initial homology_modelling step that allows the user to run predictions starting from protein_sequence in cases where a known structure is not available
