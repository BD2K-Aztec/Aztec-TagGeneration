protein multi location prediction utilizing interdependencies via a generative_model motivation proteins are responsible for a multitude of vital tasks in all living_organisms given that a proteins function and role are strongly related to its subcellular_location protein location prediction is an important research area while proteins move from one location to another and can localize to multiple_locations most existing location prediction systems assign only a single location per protein a few recent systems attempt to predict multiple_locations for proteins however their performance leaves much room for improvement moreover such systems do not capture dependencies among locations and usually consider locations as independent we hypothesize that a multi location predictor that captures location inter dependencies can improve location predictions for proteins results we introduce a probabilistic generative_model for protein_localization and develop a system based on itwhich we call mdlocthat utilizes inter dependencies among locations to predict multiple_locations for proteins the model captures location inter dependencies using bayesian_networks and represents dependency between features and locations using a mixture_model we use iterative processes for learning model_parameters and for estimating protein locations we evaluate our classifier mdloc on a dataset of single and multi localized proteins derived from the dbmloc dataset which is the most comprehensive protein multi localization dataset currently available our results obtained by using mdloc significantly improve upon results obtained by an initial simpler classifier as well as on results reported by other top systems proteins are responsible for a multitude of diverse vital tasks in all living_organisms given that a proteins function and role are strongly related to its subcellular_location protein location prediction is an important research area furthermore the location of a protein helps understand the proteins prospective utility as a drug_target methods for determining protein locations include experimental as well as high_throughput computational ones the experimental methods accurately determine protein locations but are typically time consuming and are typically not cost_effective for finding locations for a large number of proteins such methods include mass_spectrometry and green fluorescence_detection on the other hand the computational_methods are fast and can potentially predict locations for proteins whose actual locations have not yet been experimentally_determined most of the prediction systems represent proteins using sequence derived features and utilize machine_learning e g proteins move from one location to another and localize to multiple subcellular_compartments for instance the enzyme trex which assists in dna_repair is v c the author published_by
