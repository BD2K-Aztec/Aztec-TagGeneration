automatic determination of net neutrophil_extracellular coverage in fluorescent microscopy_images motivation neutrophil_extracellular nets are believed to be essential in controlling several bacterial_pathogens quantification of nets in vitro is an important tool in studies aiming to clarify the biological and chemical factors contributing to net production stabilization and degradation this estimation can be performed on the basis of fluorescent microscopy_images using appropriate labelings in this context it is desirable to automate the analysis to eliminate both the tedious process of manual_annotation and possible operator specific_biases results we propose a framework for the automated determination of net content based on visually annotated images which are used to train a supervised machine_learning we derive several methods in this framework the best results are obtained by combining these into a single prediction the overall q of the combined method is by having two experts label part of the image_set we were able to compare the performance of the algorithms to the human interoperator variability we find that the two operators exhibited a very high correlation on their overall assessment of the net coverage area in the images r is although there were consistent differences in labeling at pixel level q which unlike r does not correct for additive and multiplicative biases was only neutrophils are important effectors of the innate_immune system in mammals constituting the first line of defense against many microbial_pathogens upon tissue_injury and infection neutrophils circulating in the blood are recruited to the site of inflammation or infection contributing to pathogen clearance through phagocytosis production of highly_toxic reactive_oxygen and release of granule_proteins with antimicrobial_activity in recent_years it has been shown that some inflammatory_mediators as well as a wide_range of microbes including bacteria fungi and protozoa can stimulate neutrophils to undergo a distinctive form of cell_death designated netosis this process leads to the extracellular release of fibers of dna associated with histones granule_proteins and peptidesneutrophil extracellular traps nets these are capable of entrapping microbial_pathogens and mediate their extracellular killing it is also becoming increasingly clear that net formation is linked to multiple neutrophil mediated pathologies and that it is implicated in vascular_injury and thrombosis since the first identification of nets by this has become an area of active research with many studies relying on the in vitro production and quantification of nets as means to further understand the mechanisms_involved in their formation as well as their importance in pathogen clearance and in the development of multiple_diseases the spectrofluorometric quantification of net content based on dna release using dna intercalating dyes has been frequently used however this can be confounded by the necrotic release of dna and by the influence of peptides present in nets such as ll which can affect the binding of dna to such dyes the quantification of the area covered by nets on fluorescent microscopy_images is a suitable alternative but visual quantification besides being tedious and labor_intensive has reproducibility problems and can present interoperator differences in order to avoid these pitfalls an automatic quantification_method is needed a method for the semiautomatic quantification of in vitro net formation in microscopy_images has been recently_proposed based on the calculation of the percentage of neutrophils that are under netosis corresponding mostly to a cell_death program that leads to chromatin_decondensation and net formation this method is useful for evaluating net induction by different stimuli but is not suitable for net degradation experiments in these experiments net production is chemically_induced so that virtually all neutrophils are activated and the ability of degrading nets is then evaluated based on the quantification of the dna fibers preliminary_analysis showed that threshold based_methods whichsuccessfully used to detect nets were not able to quantify the area of the slide that was covered in nets which requires a more precise quantification we thus developed a more sophisticated method based on a supervised machine_learning approach that has shown good results in other areas of bioimage_informatics including most similar to our work in the segmentation of fluorescent images these methods have even been reported to outperform human evaluation on some tasks in particular we used a supervised_learning approach whereby we learn a regression_model to determine net fraction in local_regions based on numeric features computed from the pixels in that region finally all the regions in an image are aggregated for a combined prediction we present three different implementations of this generic framework based on particular choices for splitting the image into regions and different feature_sets we also show that we can combine the outputs of the different implementations to obtain a single combined result which outperforms all the individual predictions as evaluated by cross_validation part of our data was annotated by two different experts enabling us to quantify interoperator variation we observe that the two experts have large disagreements on a pixel by pixel level with smaller disagreements on the global appreciation of the image however we also document a systematic_bias between the two experts highlighting the potential pitfalls of relying on human visual classification we present a framework for automated quantification of net area in fluorescent microscopy_images based on this generic framework we implemented three specific methods follow_up work may make different choices of implementation and arrive at different methods the use of different feature_sets different oversegmentation methods or a different regression methodology are all potential_avenues toexplore whilst staying within the generic framework we propose in this work the final output of our method is a single fraction measurement which does not directly relate back to pixel assignments while the ideal_method would compute a perfect segmentation from which the net fraction would be trivially estimated it is not necessary to obtain this segmented image in order to solve a biologically_relevant question a single fraction estimate can provide enough information for the user this is in accordance with work in computer vision which had previously shown that to get accurate cell_counts it is not necessary to completely segment individual cells the fact that we only aimed to obtain single overall estimate from each image instead of pixel assignments allowed us to build a stacked estimator from the different methods to obtain a final prediction even though these do not share the same partitions of the image on our data the gains from combining different predictions is at least partially explained by the fact that the errors of the different methods are only weakly correlated previous work byhad demonstrated the need for careful delineation of data for cross_validation in the context of subcellular_location determination in this work we reinforce the point in a different context namely automated determination of net content by demonstrating that when different images from the same sample are used for training and testing the measured performance is increased relative to validation from data from different samples this is likely due to overfitting to match very particular aspects of each slide as opposed to generalizable features of nets we also empirically investigated and measured the agreement between different human evaluators the results require a nuanced interpretation the pixel level agreement is very low but the two experts have very high correlation in their evaluations of the images this is another instance where pixel level measures are misleading a phenomenon we and others had already investigated in the case of nuclear segmentation the general conclusion is that for evaluation of automated techniques the evaluation measure should be as close as possible to the underlying biological goal in our case the fraction of the sample covered by nets and not an intermediate result the exact locations of such areas the high correlation between human operators was hiding a systematic_bias in quantitative results one of the operators systematically reported a lower value the automated method was more consistent with the data that it was trained on resulting in a lower q value although the samples were prepared using the same protocol the image_acquisition equipment and parameters were not the same see section despite these differences the proposed algorithm was able to classify equally well images obtained with either condition suggesting that it is insensitive to any potential specificities introduced the automated method has a lower cost perfect reproducibility and results in a faster processing of the images than human annotation automated analysis opens up the possibility of multistudy comparisons by consortia of independent laboratories which can be trained with their data and assessed by the method proposed this can result in more robust training_sets that can accommodate more significant differences in sample_preparation protocol and data_acquisition conditions in its current form the robustness of the proposed automated process when combined with automated image_acquisition can facilitate the analysis in a single laboratory of numbers of fields and samples that would be prohibitive using manual_annotation such large_scale analysis will certainly improve confidence in the determination of net area providing more accurate and reproducible analyses than is currently available from human annotation our data is available for others in the community
