wavelet_based image_fusion in multi view three_dimensional microscopy motivation multi view microscopy_techniques such as light_sheet fluorescence_microscopy lsfm are powerful_tools for d time studies of live embryos in developmental_biology the sample is imaged from several points of view acquiring a set of d views that are then combined or fused in order to overcome their individual limitations views fusion is still an open_problem despite recent contributions in the field results we developed a wavelet_based multi view fusion method that due to wavelet_decomposition properties is able to combine the complementary directional information from all available views into a single volume our method is demonstrated on lsfm acquisitions from live sea_urchin and zebrafish_embryos the fusion results show improved overall contrast and details when compared with any of the acquired volumes the proposed method does not need knowledge of the systems point_spread psf and performs better than other existing psf independent fusion methods availability_and the described method was implemented in matlab the mathworks inc usa and a graphic_user was developed in java the software together with two sample datasets is available atwe propose a novel methodology to fuse multi view images such as those obtained from light_sheet based fluorescence_microscopy but not limited to that particular technique almost any imaging_technique in which several volumes of the same object are acquired each of one providing incomplete and complementary information could benefit from the proposed fusion scheme including recent light_sheet techniques like dslm using structured illumination our method is based on wavelet multi_scale and multi orientation decomposition of the input volumes and does not rely on a priori_knowledge of the system psf while psf aware methods have more potential for reducing psf related artifacts the proposed method can be used on those situations in which such knowledge is not available as is the case with lsfm acquisition where the psf varies over the volume due to light_sheet shape and to distorsion caused by the specimen itself with respect to the other psf independent method mentioned in this work content based weighted averaging the new method
