a boolean_network of the fa brca pathway motivation fanconi_anemia fa is a chromosomal_instability syndrome originated by inherited mutations that impair the fanconi_anemia breast_cancer fa brca pathway which is committed to the repair of dna_interstrand icls the disease displays increased spontaneous chromosomal_aberrations and hypersensitivity to agents that create dna_interstrand in spite of dna_damage fa brca deficient cells are able to progress throughout the cell_cycle probably due to the activity of alternative dna_repair or due to defects in the checkpoints that monitor dna_integrity results we propose a boolean_network of the fa brca pathway checkpoint_proteins and some alternative dna_repair to our knowledge this is the largest network model incorporating a dna_repair pathway our model is able to simulate the icl repair_process mediated by the fa brca pathway the activation of checkpoint_proteins observed by recurrent dna_damage as well as the repair_of and dna_adducts we generated a series of simulations for mutants some of which have never been reported and thus constitute predictions about the function of the fa brca pathway finally our model suggests alternative dna_repair that become active whenever the fa brca pathway is defective fanconi_anemia fa is a chromosomal_instability syndrome characterized by bone_marrow congenital_abnormalities and an increased risk to develop cancer d cells of patients with fa display increased chromosomal_aberrations and are hypersensitive to agents that create dna_interstrand icls the reported prevalence of fa ranges from to cases per one million persons while the heterozygous carrier_frequency is about one case per persons although the true frequency is probably higher with a median_age of years d fa to whom correspondence should be addressed represents a suitable model to study human dna_repair and it is gaining relevance because heterozygous_carriers have a high_risk of developing malignancies such as breast_cancer fa is a genetically_heterogeneous disease caused by mutations in at least one of the distinct genes namely fanca fancb fancc fancd brca fancd fance fancf fancg fanci fancj brip bach fancl fancm fancn palb fanco rad c and fancp slx these genes are involved in the so_called fanconi_anemia breast_cancer fa brca pathway dedicated to the repair of dna icls currently there is no consensus regarding the precise nature of the fa brca pathway or the network of interactions established with other genes proteins involved in fa we hereby propose the regulatory_network established among protein_complexes that include the aforementioned proteins of the fa brca pathway moreover this network includes nodes to describe the three types of dna_damage commonly observed in fa we thereafter implement the fa brca network as a discrete dynamical system and study its behavior the modeling of regulatory_networks of biological interest as discrete dynamical_systems is a well established methodology boolean_networks the simplest form of discrete dynamical_systems have been used to model a wide_variety of processes such as the genetic control of floral morphogenesis in arabidopsis_thaliana the differentiation process of t_helper lymphocytes the control of the mammalian cell_cycle and the surviving process of malignant_cells in large_granular leukemia to name a few examples this type of approach is widely used to study the dynamical behaviour of regulatory_networks because of its straightforwardness robustness and compatibility with published qualitative_data there are some mathematical_models that describe dna_repair see for example crooke and parl however to our knowledge the model presented here is the first dynamical system proposed specifically for the fa brca dna_repair pathway this model is able to reproduce the icls repair_process mediated by the fa brca pathway and the repair_of dsbs and dna_adducts adds in order to obtain a dynamical_behavior that reproduces the experimental_data we propose thewe presented in this article the reconstruction of the fa brca network as well as its implementation as a discrete dynamical system and its behavior under a number of simulated mutations and dna_damages to our knowledge this is the first network model incorporating this dna_repair pathway we simulated with the model the dynamical_behavior leading to alternative routes of dna_repair that might help explain the phenotype of cells obtained from patients with fa our simulations strongly suggest that the use of alternative dna_repair help to safeguard the integrity of the genome although the choice of pathway does not warrant a proper joining of damaged_dna while we did not present a formal robustness analysis of the fa brca network the results shown here are suggestive of a robust system the recovery of a small number of attractors all of them with a clear qualitative biological_interpretation even under the systematic alteration of the network to represent lossand gain_of imply that the network has a strong canalizing dynamical_behavior moreover out of the possible
