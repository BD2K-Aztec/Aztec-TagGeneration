data_and adapt nmr enhancer complete package for reduced dimensionality in protein nmr_spectroscopy adapt nuclear_magnetic adapt nmr offers an automated approach to the concurrent acquisition and processing of protein nmr_data with the goal of complete backbone and side chain assignments what the approach lacks is a useful graphical_interface for reviewing results and for searching for missing peaks that may have prevented assignments or led to incorrect assignments because most of the data adapt nmr collects are d tilted planes used to find peaks in d spectra it would be helpful to have a tool that reconstructs the d spectra the software_package reported here adapt nmr enhancer supports the visualization of both d tilted planes and reconstructed d peaks on each tilted plane adapt nmr enhancer can be used interactively with adapt nmr to automatically assign selected peaks or it can be used to produce pine sparky like graphical dialogs that support atom by atom and peak by peak assignment strategies results can be exported in various formats including xeasy proton file prot pine pre assignment file str pine probabilistic output_file sparky peak list file list and talos input_file tab as an example we show how adapt nmr enhancer was used to extend the automated data_collection and assignment results for the protein aedes_aegypti sterol_carrier availability the program in the form of binary code along with tutor ials and reference manuals is available at http pine one of the goals of protein nuclear_magnetic nmr_spectroscopy is to increase its throughput by automating the steps of data_collection spectral assignment and structure_determination the latest approach towards this goal from our laboratory is adapt nmr a software_package that interfaces with the nmr spectrometer and uses an algorithm for devising a pathway for optimal data_collection to approach the goal of complete data assignment as new data are collected adapt nmr analyzes the set of data collected up to that point and chooses the next step for data_collection each data_collection step involves choosing a d nmr experiment and a particular tilted plane that will identify peaks in the d spectrum adapt nmr incorporates an earlier approach to fast data_collection hifi nmr and an algorithm for automated probabilistic assignment pinenmr the output from adapt nmr is a probabilistic assignment table and analysis of secondary_structure as a means for visualizing the spectral_data picked peaks and spin system assemblies underlying these assignments we have developed the standalone software_package described here adapt nmr enhancer experiment that pine considered as possible assignments for the selected atom if the constructed d spectrum does not exhibit the predicted peak the user can examine the linked d tilted planes for evidence of a peak this examination is accomplished by double clicking the candidates so as to view the corresponding d peak the probable assignment dialog box pops up when a d peak from the d list box or from the spectral view is selected it lists possible assignments for a peak along with their probabilities the pine assignment dialog box is based on atoms whereas the probable assignment dialog box is based on peaks the user can either confirm or modify the assignment for a d peak the decision is stored in the confirmation list box and the results can be exported in a variety of file_formats
