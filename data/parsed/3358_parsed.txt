structural_bioinformatics openstructure a flexible software framework for computational_structural motivation developers of new methods in computational_structural are often hampered in their research by incompatible software_tools and non standardized data_formats to address this problem we have developed openstructure as a modular open_source platform to provide a powerful yet flexible general working environment for structural_bioinformatics openstructure consists primarily of a set of libraries written in c with a cleanly designed application programmer interface all functionality can be accessed directly in c or in a python layer meeting both the requirements for high_efficiency and ease of use powerful selection queries and the notion of entity views to represent these selections greatly_facilitate the development and implementation of algorithms on structural data the modular integration of computational core methods with powerful visualization_tools makes openstructure an ideal working and development environment several applications such as the latest versions of iplt and qmean have been implemented based on openstructuredemonstrating its value for the development of next generation structural_biology algorithms availability source_code licensed under the gnu lesser general_public and binaries for macos x linux and windows are available for download at http www openstructure org we introduce openstructure a flexible software framework for computational_structural a solid yet flexible and versatile toolkit for rapid_prototyping of new methods as well as their productive implementation typically method development in structural_bioinformatics involves combining different independent software_tools and significant effort is devoted to writing code for input_output operations and format conversions between different packages this culminates when data and algorithms from different domains are to be combined e g protein_structures protein sequence_annotation and chemical ligands several software_tools and frameworks are available today for molecular_modeling e g mmtk to whom correspondence should be addressed coot molide modeller bioinformatics algorithms libraries e g ball workflow automation tools e g biskit or knime www knime org and visualization e g vmd pymol www pymol org dino www dino d org or swisspdbviewer openstructure is a flexible software framework tailored for computational_structural which combines a c based library of commonly used functionality with a python layer and powerful visualization_tools while pymol and vmd also combine a scripting environment with sophisticated visualization_tools they are primarily geared toward visualization and less on providing a clean application programmer interface api that is easy to use and allows for rapid development of new algorithms openstructure is also designed to easily accommodate interfaces to already existing software this allows for rapid visually enhanced prototyping of new functionality making openstructure an ideal environment for the development of next generation structural_biology algorithms for example new versions of the qmean tools for model_quality b are based on openstructure as well as the structural analysis tools in proteinmodelportal further work is on the way to implement the next generation of the swiss model pipeline using the openstructure framework
