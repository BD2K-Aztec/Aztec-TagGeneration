genoexp a web_tool for predicting gene_expression levels from single_nucleotide understanding the effect of single_nucleotide snps on the expression_level of genes is an important goal we recently_published a study in which we devised a multi snp predictive_model for gene_expression in lymphoblastoid_cell lcl and showed that it can robustly predict the expression of a small number of genes in test individuals here we validate the generality of our models by predicting expression_profiles for genes in lcl in an independent study and extend the pool of predictable genes for which we are able to explain more than of their expression variability to genes across different cell_types as the number of people who obtained their snp profiles through companies such as andme is rising rapidly we developed genoexp a web_based in which users can upload their individual snp data and obtain predicted expression levels for the set of predictable genes across the different cell_types our tool thus allows users with biological_knowledge to study the possible effects that their set of snps might have on these genes and predict their cell_specific levels relative to the population average in recent_years individual genotype i e single_nucleotide data have become readily_accessible via directto consumer genetic_testing dtcgt companies such as andme decodeme and navigenics these companies allow users to acquire their allele calls at m snps across the genome as well as a report of higher and lower risk for certain diseases based on their genotyped snps since we have recently_developed to robustly predict gene_expression solely from genotype we decided to enable users to predict their own gene_expression across multiple cell_types to this end we developed genoexp a web_based where users can upload their raw genotype files obtained from any dtcgt company and view their predicted gene_expression for a set of predictable genes across different cell_types to demonstrate the application of genoexp we used andme genotype data provided willingly by one individual we show the resulting predictions of gene_expression and highlight examples such as a gene known to play a role in learning and memory that is predicted to be expressed above population mean in brain cells of that individual our recently_published method was developed using genotype and gene_expression data taken from lymphoblastoid_cell lcls of individuals therefore we wished to test whether we could apply it to other tissues or cell_types as well for this purpose we obtained two additional independent datasets that contained both genotype and gene_expression for different individuals genotype tissue expression next we ran our predictive pipeline separately for the data in each of the cell_types supplementary figs s s specifically for each cell_type we used a strict fold_cross scheme to learn a predictive_model for the expression of each gene from the genotype of its cis snps across individuals and evaluated the performance of our models on held out test individuals from the same gene and cell_type we found that across all cell_types a total of unique genes exceeded an r of on test data i e more than of expression variability is explained on held out individuals in at least one of the cell_types these genes were therefore defined as predictable genes supplementary next to test the generality of our models we further obtained additional genotype data coupled with gene_expression of twin_pairs i e a total of individuals from the multiple tissue human expression resource muther when applying the models learned from lcls to the muther data we found that in of cases we predicted the correct direction of over or under expression see supplementary text for extended details strengthening the validity of our predictions finally we wanted to allow users to predict their own gene_expression across multiple cell_types using our predictive_models to this end we developed genoexp a web_based where users can upload their raw genotype files obtained from any dtcgt company e g andme and view their predicted gene_expression for the predictable genes across the different cell_types supplementary to demonstrate the application of genoexp we used andme genotype data willingly provided by one individual supplementary we found that for this individual some genes are predicted as expressed above populationmean in all cell_types where prediction is possible e g hla_drb snps used for prediction in skin shown in supplementary whereas other genes are predicted as expressed below populationmean e g kctd clearly this over and under expression does not necessarily imply functional consequences yet they could be suggestive for example the gene churc which was predicted to be expressed above population mean in all cell_types in the brain has a homolog that was shown to play_a in the development of neurons and a deletion of the genomic_region containing it has been linked to autism in addition the amfr gene that was shown to be involved in the process of learning and memory in the central_nervous of mice was also predicted to be expressed above population mean in the brain cells of the tested individual of cis snps as covariates in the prediction_problem and learned the predictive_model as described in manor and segal however due to the fact that the k nearest_neighbor model is both memory and computationally_intensive in the web_tool we restricted ourselves to the regularized linear version of the model
