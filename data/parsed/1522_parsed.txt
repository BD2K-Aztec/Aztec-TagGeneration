ebseq hmm a bayesian_approach for identifying gene_expression changes in ordered rna_seq experiments motivation with improvements in next_generation and reductions in price ordered rna_seq experiments are becoming common of primary interest in these experiments is identifying genes that are changing over time or space for example and then characterizing the specific expression changes a number of robust statistical_methods are available to identify genes showing differential_expression among multiple conditions but most assume conditions are exchangeable and thereby sacrifice power and precision when applied to ordered data results we propose an empirical_bayes mixture modeling approach_called ebseq hmm in ebseq hmm an auto regressive hidden_markov is implemented to accommodate dependence in gene_expression across ordered conditions as demonstrated in simulation and case studies the output proves useful in identifying_differentially and in specifying gene specific expression paths ebseq hmm may also be used for inference regarding isoform_expression availability_and an r package containing examples and sample datasets is available at bioconductor with improvements in next_generation and reductions in price ordered rna_seq experiments are becoming common of primary interest in these experiments is characterizing how genes are changing over some factor with ordered levels for example ordered in time in space along a gradient etc for simplicity we refer to any ordered rna_seq experiment as a time course experiment noting that other similar designs may be analyzed within this framework and we restrict attention to timecourse data collected within a single biological condition in a time course rna_seq experiment an investigator may be interested in genes that are monotonically increasing or decreasing that increase initially then decrease that increase initially then remain_unchanged and so on we refer to these types of changes in expression hereinafter as expression paths and we consider three broad types i constant paths expression remains unchanged or equally expressed ee over all time points ii sporadic paths expression shows some change between at least one pair of time points but remains unchanged between at least one other pair and iii dynamic paths expression changes continuously with respect to the examples listed earlier the first few expression is monotonically increasing monotonically decreasing increasing then decreasing are instances of dynamic paths the last increase initially then remain_unchanged is an example of a sporadic path a number of robust statistical_methods are available for identifying differentially_expressed de genes ebseq deseq edger voom bayseq cuffdiff as well as isoforms ebseq rseqdiff cuffdiff bitseq in a static rnaseq experiment and most of these methods accommodate timecourse experiments by considering time as a factor with multiple unordered levels supplementary section s provides details the statistical_tests employed are designed to identify a gene as de if it shows a change at least one time point and consequently non constant genes are detected collectively multiple_steps of subsequent analyses are required if an investigator wants to distinguish sporadic paths from dynamic ones to classify genes into distinct paths and to assess the associated classification uncertaintyfor example perform model_fitting multiple times with different design matrices and then adjust for multiple testing in addition as these approaches were not designed specifically for time course experiments they do not accommodate dependence over time and consequently sacrifice power if applied in this setting these same issues were addressed in the context of microarray time course experiments and a number of methods are available for analyzing and clustering time course microarray_data these methods are not directly applicable to rna_seq studies since they do not accommodate count_data the unequal variabilities in measurements or the dependence of isoforms within genes to address this the approach developed by masigpro originally developed for microarray time course analysis was recently extended to accommodate ordered rna_seq count_data like deseq and edger masigpro glm is based on a negative_binomial nb generalized_linear glm but unlike previous_approaches masigpro glm defines gene specific expected expression by a time dependent polynomial to accommodate dependence over time once significant genes are selected a second regression is conducted for each gene to identify the time points at which it shows expression differences clustering_algorithms are then applied to the resulting regression_coefficients and or expression values to identify groups of genes with similar expression_profiles although useful the two step procedure makes it challenging to determine appropriate thresholds for false_discovery fdr control and suggested thresholds are conservative in many settings in addition identified gene groups are subject to limitations inherent in clustering_algorithms namely the number of groups as well as group_membership are determined by user_defined cutoffs there is no probabilistic information associated with a given genes membership within a group and it is not clear how to classify gene groups into expression paths to address these considerations we have developed an empirical_bayes auto regressive hidden_markov hmm_based approach_called ebseq hmm the model extends our previous work ebseq for identifying de genes and isoforms across two or more biological conditions as detailed in methods an auto regressive process describes changes in expression over time and a hidden_markov component is used to accommodate dependence ebseq hmm allows users to identify genes with non constant expression over multiple ordered conditions and simultaneously classify them into expression paths results from a simulation_study detailed in section suggest that ebseq hmm has increased power over competing approaches for identifying genes following non constant paths especially for those genes showing subtle yet consistent changes over time ebseq hmm also provides improved accuracy in classifying genes into expression paths similar results are demonstrated in a case study of the adult mouse limb presented in section we have developed an approach_called ebseq hmm for analysis of ordered rna_seq experiments ebseq hmm may be used to identify genes that are de across a set of ordered conditions and to classify genes into their most likely expression paths there are a number of methods available for identifying de genes that may be used when data from multiple conditions is available ebseq hmm has two main advantages over these approaches first it accommodates dependence across ordered conditions and consequently has increased power to identify genes showing subtle yet consistent changes second for every gene ebseq hmm calculates the genespecific pp associated with each possible expression path and in doing so allows for genes to be classified into distinct expression paths with a pre specified fdr put another way ebseq hmm not only identifies genes that change across conditions but can be used to specify how they change simulations demonstrated the power of ebseq hmm over other approaches to identify de genes in particular results showed that deseq edger and voom perform well in detecting trends and or changes are relatively strong but that ebseq hmm has increased power to identify genes showing weaker changes ebseq hmm also worked well for identifying genes showing sporadic changes where there is no dependence across ordered conditions as for some genes in sim ii applying masigpro glm with its default cutoff for calling de genes gave significantly_reduced power than other approaches relaxing the cutoff improved its power but it was still inferior to the others in addition to de gene identification ebseq hmm performed well for classifying genes into expression paths we defined a gene as being in a particular path if the gene was classified as de at fdr pp of ee was less than and the pp of being in that path exceeded given the two step process observed mis classification rates were conservatively controlled note that in some cases a de gene may not be classified to any particular path for example if the last time point of a four condition experiment is known to be noisy a gene that is initially increasing may have equal pp say one third of being up up up up up ee and up up down this gene would be called de with fdr since pp ee ee ee but it would not be assigned into a particular expression path if threshold was used in some cases a user may want to modify these thresholds if a false_negative classification was considered more serious than a false_positive this threshold could be adjusted motivation for doing so under varying loss functions is discussed in
