databases_and cistromemap a knowledgebase and web_server for chip_seq studies in mouse and human transcription and chromatin regulators and histone_modifications play_essential in gene_expression regulation we have created cistromemap as a web_server to provide a comprehensive knowledgebase of all of the publicly_available chip_seq data in mouse and human we have also manually_curated metadata to ensure annotation consistency and developed a user_friendly display matrix for quick navigation and retrieval of data for specific factors cells and papers finally we provide users with summary_statistics of chip_seq studies transcription regulators chromatin regulators and histone_modifications play_key eukaryotic gene transcription_regulation in normal_physiology and diseases here transcription regulators include transcription_factors transcription_initiation complexes mediator complex and transcription co activators repressors chromatin regulators refer to chromatin associated factors such as chromatin remodelers histone_modifying and other factors associated with specific chromosome or nuclear compartments mapping the genomewide in vivo locations of these factors and marks is important to understand the mechanisms of transcriptional and epigenetic_regulation with the development of high_throughput chip_seq have become popular techniques to
