gene_expression reconstructing transcription_factor activities in hierarchical transcription network_motifs motivation a knowledge of the dynamics of transcription_factors is fundamental to understand the transcriptional regulation_mechanism nowadays an experimental measure of transcription_factor activities in vivo represents a challenge several methods have been developed to infer these activities from easily measurable quantities such as mrna_expression of target_genes a limitation of these methods is represented by the fact that they rely on very simple single layer structures typically consisting of one or more transcription factors_regulating a number of target_genes results we present a novel statistical_inference methodology to reverse_engineer the dynamics of transcription_factors in hierarchical network_motifs such as feed_forward loops the approach we present is based on a continuous time representation of the system where the high_level master transcription_factor is represented as a two state markov jump process driving a system of differential_equations we solve the inference problem using an efficient variational approach and demonstrate our method on simulated_data and two real_datasets the results on real_data show that the predictions of our approach can capture biological behaviours in a more effective way than single layer models of transcription and can lead to novel biological_insights unraveling the regulation mechanisms of gene_expression is a fundamental problem in systems_biology recent_years have seen tremendous advances towards this goal driven by technological_advances in experimental_techniques as well as a systematic application of mathematical_modelling high_throughput techniques such as microarrays and chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip have uncovered much important information on gene_expression and the architecture of biological transcriptional_networks combining this information in predictive mathematical_models can yield precious insights in the way biological_systems work nonetheless in order to understand and predict mechanistically the behaviour of a transcriptional_control system to whom correspondence should be addressed an understanding of the dynamics of transcription_factors tfs response to environmental signals is essential nowadays an experimental measure of tfs activities represents a challenge since tfs are often present at very low concentrations and they are frequently post transcriptionally_regulated through allosteric changes this motivated many groups to develop quantitative statistical_models in order to infer activities of tfs by combining mrna_expression measurements of their target_genes with data about the architecture of the regulatory_network usually obtained from chip on chip experiments broadly speaking two different classes of approach have been proposed simplified models of large transcriptional_networks and detailed kinetic_models of small subnetworks the first type of models are usually discrete time models that use log_linear approximations to infer the activities of hundreds of tfs from thousands of target_genes while recent_advances can model non linear interactions between transcription_factors on a genome_wide scale these models are still unable to capture the dynamics of gene_expression and rely on steady_state assumptions while these models do provide useful insights in biological_processes their simplified nature means that many of the subtleties of regulation will inevitably be lost the other class of approaches to which this work belongs adopts a more realistic model of the dynamics of transcriptional_regulation based_on odes and then infers the profile of the tfs directly from a continuous time representation of the system this more faithful representation of the regulatory_mechanism however comes at a higher computational_cost so that inference in this class of models has so_far been possible only on restricted transcriptional_networks with simple single layer architectures in particular all methods we are aware of consider simple networks with a single layer of unobserved tfs in most cases inference is restricted to the singleinput module sim network motif which is composed of a number of target_genes regulated by a single tf or at most a few tfs that jointly regulate a number of target_genes while these simple models constitute a strong proof_of of the methodology and may indeed be useful in specific_situations many important information_processing functions in cells are carried_out through hierarchical motifs which entail multiple_stages of transcriptional_regulation in this article we present an ode based_inference methodology for the most fundamental hierarchical transcriptional_network
