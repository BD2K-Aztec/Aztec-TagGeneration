systems_biology sysbions nested sampling for systems_biology motivation model_selection is a fundamental part of the scientific process in systems_biology given a set of competing_hypotheses we routinely wish to choose the one that best explains the observed data in the bayesian_framework models are compared via bayes_factors the ratio of evidences where a models evidence is the support given to the model by the data a parallel interest is inferring the distribution of the parameters that define a model nested sampling is a method for the computation of a models evidence and the generation of samples from the posterior parameter distribution results we present a c based gpu accelerated implementation of nested sampling that is designed for biological_applications the algorithm follows a standard routine with optional extensions and additional features we provide a number of methods for sampling from the prior subject to a likelihood constraint availability_and the software sysbions is available from http www theosysbio bio ic ac uk resources sysbions given a set of models proposed to explain some observation we seek to rank them according to the extent to which they are supported by some data likelihood based_approaches find the point at which the likelihood_function is maximized and compare models based on these maxima bayesian approaches for model_selection rest on bayes_factors the ratio of evidences of competing_models a number of methods exist to estimate the evidence a metric of the support afforded to a model by some data nested sampling is a bayesian_method for evidence estimation and parameter_inference for systems where a likelihood_function can be defined as the algorithm progresses it generates samples from the posterior parameter distribution directly we present a c based nested sampling tool for computational_biologists the user supplies a likelihood_function some experimental_data and the prior parameter distribution the program returns a value for the evidence alongside samples from the posterior parameter distribution there exists a fortran based nested sampling package multinest used in the astrophysics community our work is aimed specifically at the biological community and includes an sbml systems_biology parser so that models can be specified according to current_standards the recent growing use of nested sampling in systems_biology invites the release of a tool implementing the method
