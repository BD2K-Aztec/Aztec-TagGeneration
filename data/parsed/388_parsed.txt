a novel hybrid_gene prediction method employing protein multiple_sequence motivation as improved dna sequencing_techniques have increased enormously the speed of producing new eukaryotic genome_assemblies the further development of automated gene prediction_methods continues to be essential while the classification of proteins into families is a task heavily relying on correct gene predictions it can at the same time provide a source of additional information for the prediction complementary to those presently used results we extended the gene prediction software augustus by a method that employs block profiles generated from multiple_sequence as a protein signature to improve the accuracy of the prediction equipped with profiles modelling human dynein heavy_chain dhc proteins and other families augustus was run on the genomic_sequences known to contain members of these families compared with augustus ab_initio version the rate of genes predicted with high_accuracy showed a dramatic_increase availability the augustus project web_page is located at http augustus gobics de with the executable program as well as the source_code available for download with ever faster and cheaper sequencing_techniques the amount of available nucleotide sequence_data is growing rapidly in comparison the process of accurately annotating the generated data is still lagging far behind fully_automated annotation is essential here as the sheer amount of data make manual_inspection even as a secondary step impossible on the whole thus improving gene prediction_tools that perform automated annotation of proteincoding regions as accurate as possible is becoming increasingly important for the generation for example of the corresponding protein sequence_data to whom correspondence should be addressed in eukaryotes the computational_identification of the gene structure in simplified terms the locations of the protein coding_exons in a nucleotide_sequence is a complex and error_prone task the most direct approach is pursued by ab_initio methods that do not need any input but the genomic target_sequence itself commonly sequences are considered the result of a random_process and the outcome is the gene structure that is most likely to randomly produce the target_sequence parameters for the underlying probabilistic_model often a generalized hidden_markov ghmm are derived from a training_set of gene structures verified as accurate as in any probabilistic_approach the prediction_accuracy is limited already by constraints inherent to the model even if it is a perfect description of the data in order to overcome these theoretical bounds it is necessary to employ extrinsic sources of information that give hints whether an interval of the sequence is for example a coding exon these gene_finding methods are usually based on alignments with informant sequences comparative_methods make use of similarities with the dna of closely_related transcript based_methods map sequences to the target_genome that are known to be expressed such as ests or rna_seq while homology based_methods try to map transcripts of related genes current approaches combine these methods some including an ab_initio gene prediction gene structures found by these methods are the starting_point for the pipelines generating reference annotations for genomes rna_seq transcriptome_sequencing with next_generation methods promises major advances for gene_finding however currently the accuracy of rna_seq based gene prediction suffers from mapping ambiguities and partially contained introns especially in complex genomes homology_based gene predictors such as genewise and exonerate can determine gene structures by mapping a single protein_sequence to the target_genome others like projector combine homology_based and comparative_approaches presented a combined homology_based and comparative gene_finding method that extends the prediction beyond the homologous part to a complete gene structure but requires an established gene structure for the informant sequence protein queries highly identical to the target_sequence can be mapped with blat the software scipio can refine a mapping providedpage the gene prediction program augustus was extended by a method_combining protein_family based gene_finding with an ab_initio prediction equipped with protein signatures prediction_accuracy could be improved considerably especially on full gene level on very long genes the extrinsic protein data significantly_improves the gene prediction compared with existing programs when sequence_data only from distant_species was available the presented approach is complementary to transcript based_methods and easily combined with them offering the potential of a further improvement of prediction_accuracy block profiles are a protein signature suitable for aiding gene prediction the approach for extending the model is generic and can be used to describe other types of constraints for example on coding sequence_length future plans include the integration of intron profiles containing information about conserved intron_positions
