selective mutation_accumulation a computa tional model of the paternal age effect motivation as the mean age of parenthood grows the effect of parental age on genetic disease and child_health becomes ever more important a number of autosomal_dominant disorders show a dramatic paternal age effect due to selfish mutations substitutions that grant spermatogonial_stem a selective_advantage in the testes of the father but have a deleterious_effect in offspring in this paper we present a computational technique to model the spermatogonial stem_cell in order to examine the phenomenon and draw_conclusions across different genes and disorders results we used a markov_chain to model the probabilities of mutation and positive_selection with cell_divisions the model was fitted to available data on disease_incidence and also mutation assays of sperm donors strength of selective_advantage is presented for a range of disorders including aperts syndrome and achondroplasia incidence of the diseases was predicted closely for most disorders and was heavily influenced by the site_specific mutation_rate and the number of mutable al leles the model also successfully predicted a stronger selective_advantage for more strongly activating gain_of within the same gene both positive_selection and the rate of copy error mutations are important in adequately explaining the paternal age effect as the average age of parenthood becomes more delayed understanding the effect of parental age on child_health becomes more important the effect of maternal_age has long been acknowledged but in recent_years the effect of paternal age has been the subject of a great_deal of study paternal age has been linked to a wide_range of traits and diseases such as spontaneous occurrences of mutations that cause dominant disorders and x linked diseases congenital_defects cancer_predisposition disorders schizophrenia bipolar_disorder autism and alzheimers_disease have also been linked to fathers age reviewed in paul and robaire due to the larger number of male germline cell_divisions compared with the female germline males produce times as many mutations than females throughout evolution sperm are produced by a continually dividing population of stem_cells and each division represents a chance for replication errors to happen penrose first proposed that replication errors provided an explanation for the observed incidence of genetic_diseases with paternal age in many cases the influence of paternal age is relatively subtle compared with the large_scale chromosomal_abnormalities characteristic of maternal_age effect because point_mutations typically have small or no effect on phenotype however certain substitutions can have devastating effect on those who carry the allele diseases that show a strong paternal age effect however are not explained purely by penroses copy error hypothesis and show an exponential_increase in incidence with fathers age the mutations responsible associate editor prof alfonso valencia typically display a very specific spectrum of missense substitutions accumulating faster than the raw mutation_rate can account for substitutions associated with these disorders present in clumps indicating a positive selective mechanism of mutation_accumulation as opposed to a high mutation_rate or hot_spot model such evidence has so_far presented for achondroplasia aperts syndrome costello syndrome and noonan_syndrome there is a parallel with the intestinal crypt where mutant cells colonize their niche through selective_advantage conferred by their new phenotype it is also relevant to cancer etiology as paternal age effect mutations are typically found in tumors where p is the baseline mutation probability and a is the number of potential mutation_sites that can produce mutant_alleles we hypothesized that one of the two aperts syndrome causing mutations c g has a higher incidence than the other c g because the former occurs at a cpg_dinucleotide which has a higher mutability due to spontaneous deamination our results support this hypothesis as both of the apert mutations have a very similar r value with for c g compared with for c g these two distinct amino_acid s w and p r appear therefore to have the same selective effect on the cell and the increased incidence of s w is purely because of increased mutability at this site the projected incidence rate is very sensitive to the model_parameters and particularly the mutation_rate for example achondroplasia has a high incidence rate relative to the other diseases in see the computed r value on the other hand was middle of the range which failed to account for the high incidence rate when the baseline value for p was used once the value of p was increased to the level of a ct transition the predicted incidence agreed well so the site_specific mutation_rate accounted for the relatively high incidence rate of this disease costello syndrome thanatophoric dysplasia td adapted fromthe predicted incidence_rates after accounting for the number of alleles and the mutation_rate present close to the actual_values with the exception of fibrodysplasia ossificans_progressiva this disease is anomalous as it is a very rare_disease one in million births but it is predicted to have a high incidence rate as it is caused by a transition at a single cpg_site while the rates of substitution vary by location in the genome including the rates at cpg_sites it is unlikely the substitution_rate could be low enough at this point even if unmethylated it might be explained by a very low selective_advantage but the projected r value is high producing an o e curve similar to achondroplasia the low birth_prevalence is also not explained by low survival to term of affected offspring as fop does not show severe symptoms until later in life or by any variation of expression of the mutant_allele as it shows complete penetrance so the low incidence rate remains_unexplained
