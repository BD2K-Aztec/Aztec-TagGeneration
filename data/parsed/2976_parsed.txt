minimum message length inference of secondary_structure from protein coordinate data motivation secondary_structure underpins the folding pattern and architecture of most proteins accurate assignment of the secondary_structure is therefore an important problem although many approximate solutions of the secondary_structure assignment problem exist the statement of the problem has resisted a consistent and mathematically rigorous definition a variety of comparative_studies have highlighted major disagreements in the way the available methods define and assign secondary_structure to coordinate data results we report a new method to infer secondary_structure based on the bayesian_method of minimum message length inference it treats assignments of secondary_structure as hypotheses that explain the given coordinate data the method seeks to maximize the joint probability of a hypothesis and the data there is a natural null_hypothesis and any assignment that cannot better it is unacceptable we developed a program sst based on this approach and compared it with popular programs such as dssp_and among others our evaluation suggests that sst gives reliable assignments even on low_resolution structures periodic hydrogen_bonding patterns in globular_proteins give rise to elements of secondary structurehelices and sheets the helix and sheets were among the first structural_motifs predicted from first principles of stereochemistry by we now know these specific motifs are almost ubiquitous across the corpus of known structures eventually other repetitive motifs were also identified and the alphabet of secondary_structures was expanded to include helix helix turn turn turn and bulges among other minor elements in what follows we use the term secondary_structure to include both the classical helices and sheets and other common substructural elements accurate assignment of secondary_structure of proteins from coordinate data is an important and a challenging_problem secondary_structure underpins the architectural organization in proteins it simplifies the complex atom level description of proteins and is therefore the key to generation of schematic diagrams of their three_dimensional d folding patterns they are central in training methods geared for predicting secondary_structure from to whom correspondence should be addressed amino_acid they form a linchpin to efficient methods for structural_comparison and analysis over the last years many programs were developed to address the problem of assigning secondary_structure to protein coordinate data a broad classification can be made of the assignment strategies i methods that use distance and angle profiles of local fragments ii methods that detect hydrogen_bonds between backbone atoms iii methods that use d geometry of local fragments and iv methods that approximate the backbone trace with a set of straight_lines the following reviews some of the major earlier contributions to the literature of this problem levitt andwere the first to generate an automatic method for secondary_structure assignment based on distance and dihedral_angle profiles of c atoms over a sliding_window of four residues p sea is another method in this category which assigns secondary structural states using a short c distance mask and two c dihedral_angle criteria pross proposes an assignment based solely on backbone dihedral_angles xtlsstr calculates backbone dihedral_angles and distances and assigns secondary structural types that would be consistent with interactions of amide amide_groups observed from circular_dichroism of a protein in ultraviolet range more recently palsse was designed to delineate protein_structure into helices and strands mainly using distance and torsion_angle constraints to identify core elements which are later extended to longer segments kaksi is based on c distances and backbone dihedral_angles and designed primarily to show concordance with the manual assignments found in the protein_data pdb the most popular method in this space is dictionary of secondary_structure of proteins dssp developed by kabsch and sander dssp is based on detecting hydrogen_bonds between nitrogen and carbonyl_groups along the protein polypeptide_chain using a coulomb approximation of the hydrogen_bond energy function many now consider this method a standard for secondary structural assignment since dssp was published several methods have been designed that rely on computing the hydrogen_bond energy between backbone atoms stride is among the successful variants of dssp which uses a modified hydrogen_bond energy function as well as backbone dihedral_angles to compute its assignment secstr is another variant which improves the detection and assignment of helices which both dssp_and have difficulty characterizing implementation a program sst implementing the method described in the previous section has been developed in c programming_language the program accepts protein coordinates in the brookhaven pdb format and outputs the secondary_structure assignment both at a segment level stating the start and end_point of each secondary structural segment as well as at a residue_level the program also generates a pymol script which allows users to visualize the secondary stucture assignment datasets and comparison methods to study the performance of sst we consider a dataset of pdb structures these structures are the same as the dataset considered by excluding the structures which have been deprecated or those structures that failed running on any one of the considered methods see below these structures are divided_into four datasets highresolution hres dataset with crystal_structures solved to or better medium resolution mres dataset with crystal_structures with resolution between and resolution lowresolution lres dataset with structures with resolution and finally a dataset of nmr structures in this work we mainly compare sst with dssp_and exhaustively on the large structural dataset described earlier although there are other programs for secondary_structure assignment we had difficulty finding distributions that we could download for those we managed to download we could not install the programs due to unresolvable dependencies in their source_code however we use a web_server struct which allows manual submission of queries with a single point of access to a variety of secondary_structure assignment methods beyond dssp_and such as kaksi palsse stick xtlsstr and p sea to facilitate comparisons with other methods we randomly_selected low_resolution structures from the lres dataset and manually collected the secondary_structure assignments from the server the list of structures used in this experiment can be download from http www csse monash edu au karun sst strands respectively in general dssp is conservative in assigning regular secondary_structures resulting in shorter elements compared with output from stride and sst examining the lengths of various secondary structural segments we observe that the average length of a helix and strand segment assigned by sst is and residues respectively unlike sst which states the residue start and end_points of each segment computing the lengths of secondary_structural from dssp and strides output is problematic and error_prone shows the comparison between sst dssp_and over high medium low_resolution and nmr structures to undertake this comparison the assignments of the three programs are grouped into three classes helix of all types strand and other dssp_and use similar methods for assignment based on detecting hydrogen_bonds therefore as one would expect their assignments are highly_similar sst largely agrees with dssp_and when assigning helices strands however show some disagreement visually examining several instances we find that in many cases sst assigns longer strands than the other two methods agreement between strand assignments on nmr structures among the three methods is rather poor surprisingly even dssp_and differ enormously in this class even though their assignment methods are quite similar extends the comparison of sst with other popular_methods for assignment on low_resolution structures the table shows the percentage agreement of secondary structural assignments between the methods consistent with previous comparative_studies we see considerable_differences in the assignments in the absence of a universally acknowledged gold_standard for assignment it becomes very difficult if not impossible to objectively validate one method to be truly better than the other the observed differences mainly arise from the different criteria used by the methods however i manually examining many cases where the methods differ we find that most disagreements appear at the ends of various helical or strand segments we will use a simple example to highlight the most common type of differences gives the overall residuelevel secondary_structure assignment across different methods for a flavodoxin structure from clostridium beijerinckii wwpdb id nll dssp_and assignments are nearly identical to each other from the figure small disagreements between methods can be seen around the start and end_points of various segments demarcated by ssts segment view labelled sst seg a major difference between dssp and sst is the region lys asn which sst assigns as a strand dssp starts the segment three residues further at asn inspecting the structure we find a backbone hydrogen_bond between asp and met this might suggest the start of the strand at either asp or one residue upstream at lys as identified by sst also in the region glu ile only sst correctly assigns a helical cap glu phe leading into a helix to evaluate the consistency of ssts secondary structural assignments on coordinates solved at different resolutions we randomly_selected protein_structures for which both the superseded low_resolution coordinates and the new high_resolution coordinates were available gives the list of considered structures along with the percentage agreement between ssts assignment at different resolutions the results indicate that sst produces consistent results on structures determined at different resolutions the differences last column in agreement on the chosen structures may well represent genuine structural_differences rather than shortcomings of the algorithm further to illustrate the reliable segmentation produced by sst on structures with long curved helices and strands we chose two structures leucine_zipper protein wwpdb nkp composed of very long helices and sucrose specific porin protein wwpdb a s composed of long curved strands forming barrels although sst initially breaks the curved segments into smaller pieces the post_processing step explained in section reconstitutes these pieces back correctly into fuller segments information as the coordinates of other atoms are needed to decipher hydrogen_bonds kaksi and xtlsstr are able to process this structure but assign all residues in the chain to coil of the considered methods only sst palsse and stick assigned any secondary_structure for lack of space the overall residue_level assignment across these three methods are presented inof the supplementary text examining the structure palsse consistently overestimates the regular secondary structural regions by a large margin stick performs well especially in identifying strands however it miscalculates several secondary_structural in comparison sst produced the most reasonable segmentation of the three methods on visual_inspection of the structure reliable secondary_structure assignment is an important problem we have developed a novel information_theoretic method to address this problem using the bayesian_framework of mml inference careful examination of the results over a large number of structures suggests that our method gives consistent assignments even on lowresolution data we note that our method uses a dictionary of models composed of ideal secondary_structural the details of the models are explicit and open to scrutiny it is likely that these models can be improved essentially all models are wrong but some are useful george box however modification to the models is an improvement if and only if it yields extra compression
