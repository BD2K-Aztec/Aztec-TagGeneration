data_and phenoclustering online mining of cross_species phenotypes recently several methods for analyzing phenotype data have been published but only few are able to cope with data_sets generated in different studies with different methods or for different species we developed an online system in which more than phenotypes from a wide_variety of sources and screening methods can be analyzed together clusters of similar_phenotypes are visualized as networks of highly similar_phenotypes inducing gene groups useful for functional analysis this system is part of phenomicdb providing the worlds largest cross_species phenotype data_collection with a tool to mine its wealth of information availability freely_available www phenomicdb de contactsince mendel phenotypes especially with regard to diseases have been studied intensively to reveal genotypephenotype relationships recently the number of available methods to generate such data has grown significantly leading to the availability of large_amounts of data scattered over a multitude of data_sources mostly dedicated to single species or diseases from these integrative cross_species databases like phenomicdb have emerged building the ground for performing meta_analyses of phenotypes across species or studies with the goal to gain insights into the genetic_origin of diseases however there are only very few tools that allow analyzing such complex data in a recent meta_analysis of cross_species phenotype data we showed that clustering the free_text descriptions of phenotypes phenoclustering using advanced natural_language methods induces a clustering of genes by similarity of their associated phenotype that can be exploited for guilt byassociation analysis in particular we showed that it is possible to predict gene function within such groups with high_precision this method is now freely_available as an interactive tool integrated into the phenotype database phenomicdb
