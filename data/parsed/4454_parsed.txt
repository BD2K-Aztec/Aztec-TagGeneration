data_and structure based variable_selection for survival data motivation variable_selection is a typical approach used for molecular_signature and biomarker_discovery however its application to survival data is often complicated by censored samples we propose a new algorithm for variable_selection suitable for the analysis of high_dimensional right censored_data called survival maxmin parents and children smmpc the algorithm is conceptually_simple scalable based on the theory of bayesian_networks bns and the markov blanket and extends the corresponding algorithm mmpc for classification tasks the selected_variables have a structural interpretation if t is the survival time in general the time to event smmpc returns the variables adjacent to t in the bn representing the data distribution the selected_variables also have a causal interpretation that we discuss results we conduct an extensive empirical analysis of prototypical and state of the art variable_selection algorithms for survival data that are applicable to high_dimensional biological data smmpc selects on average the smallest variable subsets less than a dozen per dataset while statistically_significantly outperforming all of the methods in the study returning a manageable number of genes that could be inspected by a human expert availability matlab and r code are freely_available fromsurvival analysis studies the occurrence and timing of events of interest often in medicine and biology the event of interest is death hence the name survival analysis however the field is much broader as the event of interest could be disease_relapse or any other event a typical characteristic of survival data is that they are often right censored i e the data may record subject i as alive not having experienced the event until time f i follow_up time but may not contain the exact time t i the event actually occurred excluding the censored_data from the analysis systematically excludes the instances with higher probability of survival and thus severely skews the results thus typical variable_selection and regression_methods cannot be applied to model the time to event t unfortunately it is often the case that analysis techniques cannot to whom correspondence should be addressed be trivially extended for survival data arguably this is one reason why only a handful of variable_selection methods are available for this type of data variable selections primary aim is often to improve understanding of the data generating process for example a biologist may be more interested in the genes predictive of survival than in the actual predictive_model presumably the variables involved in an optimally predictive minimal irreducible model carry unique information that provides insight into the data generating process we discuss this issue in more detail in the sections to follow given the above observations algorithms with clear semantics for the selected_variables and optimality properties are desirable in this article we adapt and evaluate an existing successful and scalable method for variable_selection called the maxmin parents and children algorithm mmpc to survival analysis the method is based on the theory of bayesian_networks bn and markov blanket based variable_selection that has been recently shown to perform exceptionally well with complete non censored_data the maxmin part of the name refers to the heuristic used in the algorithm regarding the order of consideration of the variables the parents and children part of the name refers the structural interpretation of the selected_variables under certain conditions they are the parents and children adjacent nodes of t in the bn representing the data distribution we call the novel algorithm survival mmpc smmpc under certain conditions the selected nodes consist of an optimal set for prediction and minimum in terms of size in other words the selected_variables contain no irrelevant noise or superfluous redundant variables facilitating the interpretation of the model for microarray_data the selected gene_expressions always provide predictive_information for survival even when any other combination of gene_expressions is known under certain conditions this implies that no other gene is expected to be causally mediating the dependence the set of parents and children is also connected to the set of direct causes of t the causal interpretation of the returned variables is also discussed smmpc is evaluated against a variety of prototypical and state of the art variable_selection algorithms that can scale up to the dimensionality often encountered in bioinformatics univariate association filtering forward_stepwise selection bayesian_variable bvs based on greedy search lasso cox_regression used as selection method and bayesian selection based on markov_chain mcmc the variable_selection methods are coupled with several survival regression_methods the evaluation is performed on several real publicly_available highdimensional gene_expression survival datasets the results include
