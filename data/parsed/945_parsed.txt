systems_biology chea transcription_factor regulation inferred from integrating genome_wide chip x experiments motivation experiments such as chip_chip chip_seq chip pet and damid the four methods referred herein as chip x are used to profile the binding of transcription_factors to dna at a genome_wide scale such experiments provide hundreds to thousands of potential_binding for a given transcription_factor in proximity to gene coding_regions results in order to integrate data from such studies and utilize it for further biological discovery we collected interactions from such experiments to construct a mammalian chip x database the database contains interactions manually extracted from publications describing the binding of transcription_factors to target_genes we used the database to analyze mrna_expression data where we perform gene_list enrichment_analysis using the chip x database as the prior_biological gene_list library the system is delivered as a web based_interactive application called chip enrichment_analysis chea with chea users can input lists of mammalian gene symbols for which the program computes over representation of transcription_factor targets from the chip x database the chea database allowed us to reconstruct an initial network of transcription_factors connected based on shared overlapping targets and binding_site proximity to demonstrate the utility of chea we present three case studies we show how by combining the connectivity_map cmap with chea we can rank pairs of compounds to be used to target specific transcription_factor activity in cancer_cells availability the chea software and chip x database is freely_available online at http amp gene_expression using microarrays or now rna_seq are popular_methods to measure the level of mrna in mammalian_cells at a genome_wide scale yet since mrna_levels only to whom correspondence should be addressed weakly correlate with protein level data collected from mrna profiling provides little clues on how cells are regulated by the activity of transcription_factors co regulator complexes and cell signaling_pathways many methods have been applied to study transcriptional_regulation both experimentally and computationally recently large_scale experimental methods that profile the binding of transcription_factors to dna at the genome_wide level have emerged these methods include chip_chip chipseq chip pet and damid these four methods are referred to as chipx for shorthand hereinafter results from such experiments report the binding of specific transcription_factors to dna in proximity of target gene_loci commonly listing hundreds to thousands of potential regulatory_interactions such interactions are often reported in excel spreadsheets or pdf tables as supplementary_materials to research_articles or as raw data_files provided as short sequencereads in fasta_format making such data difficult for reuse so_far information from genome_wide chip x studies as well as low_throughput transcription_factor dna interaction studies is utilized to develop binding_site sequence_motifs for example jaspar and transfac are two popular databases that collect information about potential_binding into logo motifs also known as binding_site matrices these databases contain collections of transcription_factors with information on regulatory motif elements with bindingsite matrices it is straight_forward to map potential_binding across an entire_genome alternatively conserved_sequences near gene coding_regions across and within species can suggest transcription_factor and be used to improve predictions of functional transcription_factor dna interactions using multiple_alignments combined with logo motif search the obvious emerging alternative method is to utilize chip x data for linking transcription_factors to gene_expression changes by computing binding_site overrepresentation by compiling chip x experiments into a gene_list library database we can rank transcription_factors most likely responsible for the observed changes in gene_expression based on statistical enrichment_analysis we show that this method is powerful capable of capturing interesting underlying biology with clear signals such an approach likely works well because it considers the chromatin_structure of a specific cellular state in a specific experiment and as such it is a more direct way to infer transcription_factor regulation compared to sequence_based page one of the reasons high_throughput genome_wide chip x studies are expected to be more useful and accurate than computational sequence_based is because the sequence based_approaches do not take into consideration the chromatin_state of the cell under a specific experimental_condition cell_type or organism hence chipx databases and tools such as cell_types and experimental_conditions using different statistical cut_offs and experimental_techniques is challenging we chose to either use the criteria applied by the authors of each study or apply our own standard method for finding peaks and calling target_genes both approaches are simple and relatively unbiased the two approaches complement each other in regards to coverage the raw_data route excludes many of the studies currently in the database since there are many chip x publications that only provide the target list without the raw_data there are also many chip x raw data_files available in the public_domain without a publication that contains an author extracted gene_list regardless we expect that the database will rapidly continue to grow moreover multiple entries for the same transcription_factor can increase the confidence for functional_binding our initial analysis shows that overlap among different chip experiments using the same factor increases functional gene predictability for example we examined the overlap among independent oct chip x studies and compared the consensus overlapped genes with an oct knock_down followed by a microarray study initial results demonstrate that functional_genes prediction improves when multiple independent studies are combined but this should be further investigated in future_studies since we keep track in our database on information such as the cell_type organism experimental method distance to start site and peak_height we implemented filters that can be used by users to exclude the analysis from including specific organism cell_type or experimental method as well as calibrate the gene calling threshold for peak_height and distance to start site for future_studies we plan to integrate chip x data with lost of function gain of function microarray_studies as well as include more histone_modification chip x studies many of the studies that report global transcription_factor binding to dna using whole genome_wide chip x experiments also often conduct global mrna experiments after knock_down or over expression of the transcription_factors that were used in the chip x studies as well as profiling specific histone_modifications or polymerase binding using chip x technologies by combining mrna microarrays of rnaseq together with chip x transcription_factor polymerase binding and histone_modification studies we can determine which binding_sites are functional as well as which functional sites are activation or inhibition sites by combining expression data with chip x we should be able to obtain a signed and directed network which is desired for understanding pathways improving enrichment_analyses and performing dynamical simulations the chip x database and chea web_based software_tool was generated utilizing code from our previous work of developing a kinase_substrate database and software system for kinase enrichment_analysis kea these two software systems can potentially be combined since we know the group of transcription_factors genes based on changes at the mrna_level under a certain experimental_condition or in a specific disease based on tissue expression_profiling we can use known proteinprotein_interactions to build a sub network to connect these transcription_factors then we can link this sub network as input for kea to obtain the protein_kinases and pathways that most likely regulate the transcription_factor centered sub network such an approach can be used to understand cell regulation at the cell signaling_network level given mrna expression_profiling data and suggest kinase_inhibitors as drug_targets maayan and he
