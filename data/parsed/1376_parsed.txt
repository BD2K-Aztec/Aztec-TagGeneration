dflpred high_throughput prediction of disordered flexible_linker regions in protein_sequences motivation disordered flexible linkers dfls are disordered_regions that serve as flexible linkers spacers in multi_domain or between structured constituents in domains they are different from flexible linkers residues because they are disordered and longer availability of experimentally annotated dfls provides an opportunity to build high_throughput computational predictors of these regions from protein_sequences to date there are no computational_methods that directly predict dfls and they can be found only indirectly by filtering predicted flexible residues with predictions of disorder results we conceptualized developed and empirically assessed a first of its kind sequence_based predictor of dfls dflpred this method outputs propensity to form dfls for each residue in the input_sequence dflpred uses a small set of empirically selected_features that quantify propensities to form certain secondary_structures disordered_regions and structured regions which are processed by a fast linear_model our high_throughput predictor can be used on the whole proteome scale it needs h to predict entire proteome on a single_cpu when assessed on an independent test_dataset with low sequence_identity proteins it secures area under_the equal and outperforms existing alternatives that include methods for the prediction of flexible linkers flexible residues intrinsically_disordered residues and various combinations of these methods prediction on the complete human_proteome reveals that about of proteins have a large content of over dfl residues we also estimate that about dfl regions are long with consecutive residues availability_and intrinsically_disordered idps lack stable tertiary_structure under physiological_conditions either along their entire_sequence or in localized regions idps are abundant in eukaryotes and are typically involved in signaling regulation control storage of small_molecules sites for posttranslational_modifications ptms transcription translation and assembly of multi protein_complexes their functions complement functions of structured proteins which include small_molecule binding transport and catalysis the newest release of disprot database the main source of functionally annotated idps lists functions that have been assigned to about disordered_regions about of the functionally characterized disordered_regions in disprot concern binding to a variety of partners proteins dnas rnas metals and lipids the most populated non binding functions include flexible linkers sites for several types of ptms transactivation nuclear_localization and electron_transfer several methods have been developed for the prediction of binding disordered_regions from protein_sequences they include methods that address protein binding v c the author published_by
