foldnucleus web_server for the prediction of rna and protein_folding nuclei from their d structures motivation to gain insight into how biopolymers fold as quickly as they do it is useful to determine which structural_elements limit the rate of rna protein_folding summary we have created a new web_server foldnucleus using this server it is possible to calculate the folding nucleus for rna_molecules with known d structuresincluding pseudoknots trnas hairpins and ribozymesand for protein molecules with known d structures as long as they are smaller than amino_acid researchers can determine and understand which elements of the structure limit the folding_process for various types of rnas and protein molecules experimental a values for proteins can be found and compared with those determined by our method in theoretical_studies of the structure of rna_molecules the focus is often on the prediction of secondary_and of rna and on rna_folding kinetics which can be described as a free_energy because the function of rna depends on its conformation which is analogous to the relationship between the function and folding structure of proteins researchers have successfully_applied methods developed for proteins such as the a analysis in the folding_process the rna strand like a protein globule passes through numerous intermediate states able to play_a in the kinetics of the process the problem of how a biopolymer chooses its native_fold between a huge number of alternative folds is crucial for both rna and protein molecules computer experiments with rna and protein like model chains have shown that all can reach their lowest energy fold without an exhaustive_search over all possible folds it is obvious that not all nucleotides residues play a decisive role in the rna protein_folding thus the knowledge of folding nuclei a folding nucleus is the structured part of the molecule in a transient state makes it possible to reveal the structural_elements that limit the rate of rna protein_folding the theoretical prediction of the rna nucleotides residues important for the formation of a folding nucleus would define the most probable kinetic pathway of folding this in turn makes it possible to base rna protein_engineering efforts on the experimental detection of the nucleus of folding for an rna protein_structure it has recently been demonstrated for trna asp that secondary and tertiary_interactions are generated simultaneously but not in a hierarchical process as was supposed for a long time this allows us to adopt and apply an algorithm that was previously_developed for the prediction of protein_folding nuclei for rna_structures the calculated a values for trna structures agree with the previously_obtained experimental_data according to the experiment the nucleotides of the d and t hairpin loops are the last to become involved in the trna tertiary_structure the purpose of this work is the creation of a server for the prediction of the structure of folding nuclei for proteins and rna_molecules starting from known d structures
