systems_biology viewing cancer_genes from co evolving gene_modules motivation studying the evolutionary_conservation of cancer_genes can improve our understanding of the genetic_basis of human_cancers functionally_related proteins encoded by genes tend to interact with each other in a modular fashion which may affect both the mode and tempo of their evolution results in the human ppi_network we searched for subnetworks within each of which all proteins have evolved at similar rates since the human and mouse split identified at a given co evolving level the subnetworks with non randomly large sizes were defined as co evolving modules we showed that proteins within modules tend to be conserved evolutionarily old and enriched with housekeeping_genes while proteins outside modules tend to be less conserved evolutionarily younger and enriched with genes expressed in specific tissues viewing cancer_genes from co evolving modules showed that the overall conservation of cancer_genes should be mainly attributed to the cancer proteins enriched in the conserved modules functional analysis further suggested that cancer proteins within and outside modules might play different roles in carcinogenesis providing a new hint for studying the mechanism of cancer studying the evolutionary_conservation of disease cancer_genes can improve our understanding of the genetic_basis of human_diseases however current results on this topic are still inconsistent some studies suggested that disease genes related to morbid phenotypes evolve more slowly than other genes other studies indicated that disease genes may evolve faster than other genes and thus are under weaker negative_selection notably most of these studies treated disease cancer_genes and the rest genes as if they were completely isolated and uncorrelated however it is known that proteins encoded by genes tend to perform functions by interacting with each other in a modular fashion which may affect both the mode and tempo of molecular_evolution to whom correspondence should be addressed by reducing pleiotropy and enabling protein modules to be co opted for new functions thus studying the evolutionary_patterns of cancer_genes in the context of protein gene_modules may provide us new clues to understand the genetic_basis of human cancer in this study in the human ppi_network we firstly searched for ppi subnetworks within each of which all proteins have evolved at similar rates since the human and mouse split at a given co evolving level the identified ppi subnetworks with significantly large sizes were selected as co evolving modules which could be highly cohesive fragments of some co evolving functional_units comparing proteins within and outside modules we found that genes_encoding proteins within modules tend to be conserved evolutionarily old and enriched with housekeeping_genes while genes_encoding proteins outside modules are less conserved evolutionarily younger and enriched with genes expressed in specific tissues then for proteins encoded by cancer_genes collected in cancer gene census database we showed that the cancer proteins within modules tend to be evolutionarily old and conserved while the cancer proteins outside modules tend to be evolutionarily younger and less conserved thus the overall conservation of cancer proteins in comparison with other proteins should be mainly attributed to the cancer proteins enriched in co evolving modules these results suggested that cancer proteins with different evolutionary_patterns may play different functional_roles in carcinogenesis in fact we found that cancer proteins together with their co evolving neighbors within modules tend to participate in some essential_biological such as nuclear mrna_splicing via spliceosome and post_translational protein_modification while cancer proteins outside modules tend to be enriched in functions such as dna_damage and dna_repair
