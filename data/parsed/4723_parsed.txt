transcriptome guided amyloid_imaging genetic_analysis via a novel structured sparse learning algorithm motivation imaging_genetics is an emerging field that studies the influence of genetic_variation on brain structure and function the major task is to examine the association between genetic_markers such as single_nucleotide snps and quantitative_traits qts extracted from neuroimaging data the complexity of these datasets has presented critical bioinformatics challenges that require new enabling tools sparse canonical_correlation scca is a bi multivariate technique used in imaging_genetics to identify complex multi snpmulti qt associations however most of the existing scca algorithms are designed using the soft thresholding method which assumes that the input_features are independent from one another this assumption clearly does not hold for the imaging genetic data in this article we propose a new knowledge guided scca algorithm kg scca to overcome_this as well as improve learning results by incorporating valuable prior_knowledge results the proposed kg scca method is able to model two types of prior_knowledge one as a group structure e g linkage disequilib rium blocks among snps and the other as a network_structure e g gene_co among brain_regions the new model incorporates these prior structures by introducing new regularization terms to encourage weight similarity between grouped or connected features a new algorithm is designed to solve the kg scca model without imposing the independence constraint on the input_features we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm with both synthetic and real_data for real_data using an alzheimers_disease ad cohort we examine the imaging genetic_associations between all snps in the apoe gene i e top ad gene and amyloid_deposition measures among cortical_regions i e a major ad hallmark in comparison with a widely used scca implementation our kg scca algorithm produces not only improved cross_validation

structure and function its major task is to examine the association between genetic_markers such as single_nucleotide snps and quantitative_traits qts extracted from multimodal neuroimaging data e g anatomical functional and molecular_imaging scans given the well known importance of gene and imaging phenotype in brain_function bridging these two factors and exploring their connections would lead to a better mechanistic_understanding of normal or disordered brain functions the complexity of these data however has presented critical bioinformatics challenges requiring new enabling tools early studies in imaging_genetics typically focused on pairwise univariate_analysis many recent_studies turned to regression_analysis for exploring the joint_effect of multiple_snps on single or few qts and bi multivariate_analyses for revealing complex multi snpsmulti qts associations canonical_correlation cca a bi multivariate method has been applied to imaging_genetics applications it aims to find the best linear transformation for imaging and genetics features so that the highest correlation between imaging and genetic components can be achieved based on the assumption that a real imaging genetic signal typically involves a small number of snps and qts sparse canonical_correlation scca has also been applied in several imaging genetic_studies by imposing the lasso regularization term to yield sparse results however most existing scca algorithms are designed using the soft thresholding technique which assumes that the input_features are independent from one another this assumption clearly does not hold for the imaging genetic data e g the existence of the structural and functional_networks in the brain and the linkage_disequilibrium ld blocks in the genome directly ignoring the covariance_structure in the data will inevitably limit the capability of yielding optimal results in this article we propose a new knowledge guided scca algorithm kg scca to overcome_this as well as
