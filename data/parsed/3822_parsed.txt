systems_biology qsspn dynamic simulation of molecular_interaction describing gene_regulation signalling and whole cell_metabolism in human cells motivation dynamic simulation of genome_scale molecular_interaction will enable the mechanistic prediction of geno typephenotype relationships despite advances in quantitative biology full parameterization of whole cell models is not yet possible simulation_methods capable of using available qualitative_data are required to develop dynamic whole cell models through an iterative process of modelling and experimental_validation results we formulate quasi_steady petri_nets qsspn a novel method integrating petri_nets and constraint based analysis to predict the feasibility of qualitative dynamic behaviours in qualitative models of gene_regulation signalling and whole cell_metabolism we present the first dynamic simulations including regulatory_mechanisms and a genome_scale in human cell using bile_acid homeo stasis in human_hepatocytes as a case study qsspn simulations reproduce experimentally_determined qualitative dynamic behaviours and permit mechanistic analysis of genotypephenotype relationships availability_and the model and simulation software implemented in c are available in supplementary_material and atone of the fundamental goals of molecular_biology is to delineate the molecular_mechanisms by which genetic_information is expressed in response to environmental_cues giving rise to a specific phenotype given the number of molecular_components of a cell and the dynamic non linear nature of their interactions mechanistic computational modelling is an indispensable tool mechanistic_models formally represent the current knowledge about the molecular_machinery of cells the molecules and interactions included into such models reflect the extent of genome sequence_annotation with computer simulation used to predict system behaviour under particular environmental_conditions in systems_biology such unbiased representation of molecular_interactions in mechanistic_models is referred to as reconstruction in a sense the ultimate_goal of reconstruction is to reverse_engineer the entire molecular_machinery of the cell in a computer model capable of reproducing the responses of specific cells tissues to any environmental perturbation in particular the ability to predict the consequences of genetic_background on human cell behaviour is of practical importance in clinical_settings genetic and molecular_profiling of individuals and diseased tissues is becoming increasingly important not only for the development of new therapies but also in the design of patient tailored treatment regimes we believe that mechanistic prediction of genotypephenotype relationship through computer simulation of the genome_scale molecular_interaction in human cells is indispensable to the development of personalized_medicine significant effort has already been dedicated to the formal representation of existing knowledge of the molecular_machinery of the cell the predominant framework is a bipartite_graph where nodes representing molecules are connected to nodes representing interactions this representation underlies established knowledge bases such as reactome biocyc kegg and dedicated large_scale reconstructions of cellular_systems including human cell networks relevant to major diseases it is also reflected in major data_exchange standards such as systems_biology sbml and graphical notations such as systems_biology sbgn le a major roadblock in using this wealth of formally represented knowledge to predict cellular behaviour is the lack of quantitative data about molecular amounts and interaction rates a prerequisite to constructing dynamic_models despite the rapid development of quantitative methods in molecular_biology full parameterization of genome_scale dynamic_models particularly of human cell systems is still prevented by the lack of data on the other hand both high_throughput methods of functional_genomics and traditional molecular_biology routinely generate timecourse data where dynamic changes in relative molecular activity after perturbation are monitored thus there is a need to develop dynamic mechanistic computer simulation_methods capable of generating qualitative predictions about system behaviour that can be compared with available experimental_data qualitative simulation would facilitate the iterative refinement of whole cell mechanistic_models through both theoretical to whom correspondence should be

medium provided the original_work prediction and experimental_validation they would also make it possible to fully use currently available network_connectivity reconstructions to provide insights into the molecular_mechanisms of human disease although it is not yet possible to create a mechanistic_model of the molecular_interaction involving all gene_products the metabolic_capabilities of a whole cell can already be mechanistically simulated using constraint based_methods cbm briefly a set of metabolic reaction formulas is constructed according to the complement of enzymes transporters inferred from genome_annotation next a linear_model of flux distribution at steady_state is constructed and linear_programming used to identify maximal possible flux through selected reactions in the network this basic flux_balance fba method can identify metabolites that can be produced given the composition of available nutrients even at this purely qualitative level of network description the consequences of varying genetic_background can be studied through in silico gene_inactivation experiments the major_limitation in extending this methodology to other classes of molecular_interaction is the assumption of a steady_state owing to this assumption essential transient behaviours such as burst or oscillations cannot be studied however the timescale separation between fast metabolic_reactions and slow gene regulatory_processes means that constraint_based can be combined with dynamic_models of regulatory_processes these quasi_steady methods have been used for the simulation of model microorganisms where relatively small_scale metabolic_networks have been integrated with dynamic_models of regulatory_processes however none have yet been applied to the study of the clinically_relevant cellular behaviours in human tissues petri_net pn theory provides a general representation of interacting components in a network pns are bipartite graphs comprising two node classes places and transitions the state of the system is represented by the number of tokens assigned to each place transitions represent interactions within the system by moving tokens between places this formalism naturally lends itself to the representation of molecular_interaction with places representing molecules transitions molecular_interactions and tokens corresponding to numbers of molecules or discrete molecular activity levels molecular_interaction represented as pns can be analyzed using a variety of simulation and formal analysis methods developed in the pn field pns have been applied in the modelling of molecular network_dynamics however of interest here is that pns have also been shown to be advantageous for qualitative modelling of gene_regulatory and signalling_pathways b where network_connectivity is analyzed without knowledge of quantitative molecular concentrations and interaction rate_constants here we describe quasi_steady pns qsspn a novel algorithm capable of qualitative dynamic simulation of genomescale molecular_interaction including all classes of molecular_interactions we apply the algorithm to simulation of the interplay between whole cell_metabolism and gene regulatory and signalling_networks involved in bile_acid ba homeostasis in human_hepatocytes to our knowledge this is the first dynamic simulation of a molecular_interaction involving gene_regulation signalling and full genome_scale gsmn in a human cell the unique feature that enables qsspn to perform this simulation is monte_carlo sampling of the feasible dynamic sequences of molecular transitions in the qualitative quasi_steady model in the following sections we introduce qsspn method demonstrate its application to human_hepatocyte simulation and compare its features with other approaches shows an overview of the qsspn method the molecular_interactions are divided_into two sets quasi_steady fluxes qssf representing metabolic_reactions and dynamic transitions dt representing other classes of molecular_interaction such as signalling_pathways and overview of quasi_steady pn simulation the dt component of the model is represented using the pn formalism circles denote places dots within circles are tokens squares are transitions arrows are edges open circle headed arrows are inhibitory edges and full circle headed arrows are read edges gene_regulation qssf are interrogated through cbms whereas dts are represented using extended pn formalism the activities of molecular_species represented by pn places are given by an integer number of tokens in most instances tokens represent discrete levels of activity but fully quantitative description is in principle possible with node token status reflecting molecular quantities qssf and dt interaction sets are connected by two classes of pn places constraint places set flux bounds in qssf translating place token status in to flux bounds objective places represent metabolic outputs of the qssf network each molecular_interaction in a pn subset is represented by a transition connected to pre places representing substrates activators and inhibitors and post places representing products substrates and products are connected to transitions by standard edges whereas catalytic activators and inhibitors are connected to transitions by read and inhibitor edges respectively when a transition fires tokens from substrate pre places are consumed and tokens representing products fired to post places the states of pre places connected to transitions by read or inhibitor edges are not changed in the simplest definition of system dynamics transitions can fire if each substrate and activator pre place has at least one token and all inhibitory pre places have no tokens to allow formulation of general rules involving token number thresholds we define transition propensity equation we present qualitative dynamic simulations of ba homeostasis in human_hepatocytes incorporating gene_regulation signalling and whole cell_metabolism this is the first dynamic simulation of molecular_interaction describing gene_regulation signalling and whole cell_metabolism in human cells we reproduce experimentally_determined relative molecular activity timecourses and use the model to mechanistically investigate genotypephenotype relationship in a clinically_relevant system which yields novel mechanistic insight the presented mechanistic computer simulations are performed with qsspn a novel algorithm formulated in this work qsspn performs quasisteady state simulation of genome_scale molecular_interaction involving all classes of molecular_interactions metabolic_reactions are assumed to be much faster than other cellular_processes and whole cell steady_state metabolic_flux distribution is explored using well established cbms dynamic cellular_processes are represented using extended pn formalism and we introduce two new classes of pn node that integrate the steady_state metabolic_flux network and dynamic pn components of the model constraint nodes set the bounds of specified fluxes in the metabolic_network according to a lookup table mapping its discrete token state to flux bounds objective nodes use predefined lookup tables to establish token state based on the evaluation of objective_function in a whole cell metabolic model qsspn is a stochastic_simulation that generates a sample of dynamic trajectories permissible given the properties of the system under study and modelled stimuli thus each trajectory represents a feasible sequence of molecular transitions trajectory sampling is used to study the effects of system perturbation e g growth condition gene knock_down agonist_antagonist addition samples are generated for wt and perturbed states and the fraction of trajectories exhibiting a behaviour of interest is calculated for each state qsspn can be used to test not only simple reachability of a particular node of the network or the producibility of a particular metabolite but also occurrence of dynamic behaviours e g bursts and oscillations we use piecewise_linear definition of the stochastic transition propensity where contribution of the pre place substrate catalyst inhibitor to the propensity is determined by a lookup table with thresholds equations and this allows formulation of qualitative rules and enables simulations where complex qualitative dynamic behaviours can be generated in computationally_efficient models_representing molecular activities by a few discrete states taking_into the features discussed earlier in the text we believe that qsspn is substantially different to existing_approaches and offers numerous advantages in the modelling of genome_scale molecular_interaction in human cells in section of the supplementary_material we present detailed comparison with existing_approaches and the remaining part of this discussion summarizes its conclusions first the only simulation of human_metabolism in a quasi_steady framework published so_far did not include gene_regulation or signalling the cbm model used the dfba approach to integrate ode_models of drug_concentration in physiological compartments currently qualitative rule_based of regulatory_processes can be integrated with an fba of metabolism using rfba however rfba uses boolean rules expressing relationships between network nodes representing genes importantly transcription and translation processes are not distinguished and known mechanistic_details about the nature of experimentally monitored or perturbed molecules cannot be expressed both of which are achieved with qsspn we have created coarse_grained versions of our ba homeostasis model using the rfba framework supplementary_material section we show that to faithfully model human cell systems the original rfba needs to be modified to remove reliance on maximization of biomass and simulation of cell_culture growth furthermore we show that even the best adaption of rfba to simulation of human cell is still not able to achieve the predictive_power of qsspn this is due to the fact that the rfba gene_regulatory does not distinguish transcription and translation processes as a result it fails to reproduce the qualitative behaviour of transcript activity in a negatively auto regulated gene qsspn makes the correct prediction because of its representation of gene_expression which does not require quantitative_parameters but does resolve the two fundamental stages of gene_expression detailed quasi_steady models resolving mechanistic_details of gene_expression process can be constructed with ifba and idfba methods where cbms are coupled to ode_models through quasi_steady assumption alternatively detailed quantitative_models have been coupled to cbms through a diverse mathematics approach where a tailored model for a particularly well studied small model microorganism has been created however these methods require quantitative data to parameterize odes for our test case study and other clinically_relevant human systems such data are rarely available thus the qsspn is significantly better than other quasi_steady methods in addressing the trade_off between detailed representation of molecular_mechanisms and the requirement for quantitative data we believe that this makes it ideally_suited to modelling human systems where accurate quantitative knowledge is more difficult to obtain but qualitative molecular activity timecourses are readily measurable either by well established qrt_pcr and western_blot assays or high_throughput omics_technologies in section of the supplementary_material we analyze the computational_efficiency of qsspn and demonstrate that it is scalable to mechanistic modelling of gsmn in human cells the quasi_steady methods developed to date are synchronous and deterministic they produce one trajectory where at every step all rules are synchronously evaluated by comparison qsspn is the first method that enables asynchronous stochastic and rule_based simulations of a quasi_steady system involving whole cell_metabolism in every iteration only one stochastic transition is generated resulting in multiple alternative sequences of molecular_interactions this is an important advantage as biological_systems are fundamentally asynchronous meaning that asynchronous algorithms should be used for qualitative rule_based simulations moreover as qsspn allows incorporation of quantitative rates it offers the exciting prospect of building semi quantitative_models where individual trajectories are interpreted as different cellular behaviours occurring in a population of genetically identical cells because of stochastic phenotypic switching pn trajectory sampling in wild_type and perturbed systems has previously been used in the signalling pn approach for the first time qsspn uses pn trajectory sampling in the context of quasi_steady simulations involving gsmns as a result it hugely extends the scale of models that can be qualitatively studied moreover signalling pn is based on the comparison of average simulation timecourses although this can be done within the qsspn approach we recommend the implementation of an alternative approach developed in the model checking field of computer science here the numbers of trajectories exhibiting the behaviour of interest in the reference and perturbed systems are statistically_compared binomial probability confidence_interval statistics have already been used in statistical_model checking software such as prism finally we use a piecewise_linear formulation of propensity functions piecewise linear_functions were previously used to provide a discrete qualitative equivalent of ode_models here we use them for the first time to define propensity functions in a stochastic_simulation the stochastic_model checking approach is capable of analyzing arbitrary large_scale models whereas previous applications of piecewise linear_functions were limited by algorithms based on generation of full reachability graph which is usually too large to be computed for genome_scale networks in summary we believe that qsspn is a unique method for reconstruction and simulation of genome_scale molecular_interaction network_dynamics it provides qualitative insight into system dynamics through qualitative simulation and enables mechanistic simulation of genotypephenotype relationships in human cells where quantitative data are sparse and qualitative molecular_biology data are readily available it is therefore an ideal approach for the iterative cycle of reconstruction simulation and measurement that will eventually_lead the prediction of genotypephenotype relationships in human tissues through the mechanistic simulation of whole cell molecular_biology
