genome_analysis accurate computational_prediction of the transcribed_strand of crispr non_coding motivation crispr rnas crrnas are a type of small non coding rna that form a key part of an acquired immune system in prokary otes specific prediction_methods find crrna encoding loci in nearly half of sequenced bacterial and three quarters of archaeal species these clustered_regularly crispr arrays consist of repeat elements alternating with specific spacers generally one strand is transcribed producing long pre crrnas which are processed to short crrnas that base_pair with invading nucleic_acids to facilitate their destruction no current software for the discovery of crispr_loci predicts the direction of crrna transcription results we have developed an algorithm that accurately_predicts the strand of the resulting crrnas the method uses as input crispr repeat predictions crisprdirection uses parameters that are calculated from the crispr repeat predictions and flanking_sequences which are combined by weighted voting the prediction may use prior coding sequence_annotation but this is not required crisprdirection correctly_predicted the orientation of of a reference_set of arrays availability_and the perl source_code is freely_available from http bioanalysis otago ac nz crisprdirection many bacteria and archaea have defense systems that target incoming nucleic_acids termed crispr_cas clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeatscrispr associated proteins systems recent_studies that these rnamediated systems are a major antiviral mechanism in prokaryotes in bacterial genomic_sequences crisprs are characterized by repeated elements repeats interspersed with unique spacers in most systems rna_polymerase transcribes the crispr array in one direction to produce the pre crispr rna pre crrna which is processed to provide separate small_rna effectors crrnas that target foreign genetic_elements the mechanism of targeting requires a number of cas crispr associated proteins that are typically encoded nearby to the crispr arrays most crispr_cas target dna from bacteriophages plasmids and mobile_elements in bacterial chromosomes however some crispr_cas target_rna the direction of transcription is unknown for most crispr arrays and current_algorithms do not predict direction normally only one strand is transcribed and processed into small crrnas which determines base_pairing target_specificity the crrnas provide target_specificity through base_pairing for the crispr_cas system therefore target prediction_algorithms permit both potential crrnas to be analyzed as the correct strand is often unknown there are several crispr discovery programs available to find these repeat arrays in genomic or metagenomic_sequences the most cited of these crisprfinder locates crispr arrays in in of the complete_genomes of bacteria and in in of archaea as crt and piler cr are better suited to automation they are used in bacterial_genome annotation_pipelines recent crispr_cas classifications include three types iiii and at least ten subtypes these are based on multiple_criteria including the presence of specific cas proteins for those type_iii b systems that target singlestranded rna appropriate assignment of the direction of crispr expression is essential to accurately identify rna_targets and avoid false target predictions whereas for type i and ii additional short specific sequences are associated or of true targets and function in different steps of the crispr_cas process these sequences are termed protospacer adjacent motifs and recent work has suggested that these can be further discriminated into target interference motifs and spacer acquisition motifs that function at the different stages the identification of these additional determinants requires knowledge of the transcribed_strand the ability to accurately identify the target strand would also be useful to determine if during conjugation the single_strand initially transferred into the recipient is preferentially targeted repeats may be dissimilar between the same types in different species and the relationship between sequence and type is complex i e near identical repeats in the same species can be to whom correspondence should be addressed associated with different types e g i b and iii b and multiple types commonly exist with a species however repeats can independently be clustered and grouped into sequence or structural_classes the most recent analysis puts repeats into structural_motif classes sequence family classes and superclasses some of these classes are preferentially associated with specific crispr subtypes in some types i and ii the repeat rna has a stable stem_loop typically with bases in the stem pre crrna processing occurs within the repeat resulting in and handles derived from the repeats and attached to the spacer this repeat structure within the pre crrna is required for processing in type i f systems in some systems the crrna handle is uaagaaa derived from the end of the repeat in addition it has recently been shown that for a few species using type_ii systems crrna transcription can occur from multiple promoter_sequences tanaat like within the end of the repeat crispr arrays expand by acquiring specific sequences from invading nucleic_acids although it is not completely_understood this adaptation typically involves addition of new spacers at the end of the array however there is evidence of some systems acquiring new spacers at positions internal to the crispr array spacers and repeats may subsequently degenerate then be lost by successive point_mutations deletions or recombination however as clear targets of most crrnas are not present in sequence_databases it is difficult to determine if mutations have occurred in spacers in addition it is likely that both target nucleic_acids and host crrnas are accumulating mutations after the initial_contact and spacer acquisition for example phages can escape crispr_cas interference via the acquisition of point_mutations in their target_sequences and old spacers might accumulate mutations when there is no longer a selective_advantage i e in the absence of the target phage plasmid the leader is the sequence that precedes the array and contains both the promoter and region before the first repeat in some characterized systems there is clear accumulation of point_mutations in the repeats and spacers at the end of the array leader distal end consistent with this observation current data indicate that new spacers are acquired at the leader end of the crispr array and older spacers and repeats decay at the end trailer end spacers previous_studies have predicted the direction of repeats as parts of larger studies it has been observed that repeats in archaea are a rich and this has been used to determine direction in that domain recently used a richness and the presence of attgaaa c g at the end of repeats to determine the direction of repeats in this article we aimed to use information within and nearby predicted crispr arrays to determine the direction of transcription prediction was performed as much as possible independently of the use of biological_knowledge e g repeat class as this is not known for many sequences the algorithm is described and available as a perl module for a gene prediction and annotation_pipeline this crisprdirection algorithm predicts with accuracy the direction of transcription and thus the correct sequences of the crrnas that target foreign nucleic_acids crisprdirection will be useful for more accurate prediction of crispr arrays and subsequent prediction of their types and targets such as via crisprtarget we aimed to develop an algorithm to detect the direction of crispr transcription this would as much as possible be independent of specific biological_knowledge for known types of arrays as often this is neither known nor predicted such a method could be applied within a pipeline to new instances and potentially new classes of arrays the predictive methods adopted were i searching for attgaaa like sequence_motifs in the repeats ii finding biased nucleotide_composition relative at richness in the leader and trailer regions of the arrays iii analysis of mutation s in the repeats array degeneracy iv analysis of rna_secondary in the repeats v finding the longer distance to the next coding_gene at the and ends and vi greater number a compared with t in the repeat these methods are depicted in a reference_set of known direction was assembled by using a set of repeats of experimentally_determined orientation in unique arrays this was extend to repeats by allowing up to three mismatches see section the algorithm described works surprisingly well using a set of relatively easily calculable parameters at the default level of accuracy it correctly_predicts of reference arrays higher levels of accuracy e g ppv and np are possible by changing some of the parameters this method can be built into a generic prokaryotic prediction pipeline without a requirement of knowledge whether the sequence is from bacteria or archaea and without the need to define the type subtype class or superclass of the array or repeat however it is also possible for users analyzing specific genomes to incorporate biological_knowledge e g specific motifs or presence of rna_structure into the prediction
