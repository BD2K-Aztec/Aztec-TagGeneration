gene_expression a powerful and flexible_approach to the analysis of rna_sequence count_data motivation a number of penalization and shrinkage approaches have been proposed for the analysis of microarray_gene similar techniques are now routinely applied to rna_sequence transcriptional count_data although the value of such shrinkage has not been conclusively established if penalization is desired the explicit modeling of meanvariance relationships provides a flexible testing regimen that borrows information across genes while easily incorporating design effects and additional covariates results we describe bbseq which incorporates two approaches i a simple beta_binomial generalized_linear which has not been extensively tested for rna_seq and ii an extension of an expression meanvariance modeling_approach to rna_seq involving modeling of the overdispersion as a function of the mean our approaches are flexible allowing for general handling of discrete experimental factors and continuous covariates we report comparisons with other alternate_methods to handle rna_seq although penalized methods have advantages for very small_sample the beta_binomial generalized_linear combined with simple outlier_detection and testing approaches appears to have favorable characteristics in power and flexibility sequencing of rna based libraries rna_seq can provide digital gene_expression measurement and is an attractive approach potentially replacing microarrays for analyzing the transcriptome in an unbiased and comprehensive manner for genes with very low or very high levels microarrays often lack sensitivity or can result in saturated signal in contrast rna_seq has been shown to have high_accuracy across many orders of expression magnitude with clear advantages over microarray_hybridization at a basic level simple counts of rna_sequences can be used for digital gene_expression measurement and are the subject of this article additional information derived from the sequences such as to whom correspondence should be addressed
