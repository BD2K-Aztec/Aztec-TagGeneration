genome_analysis cansnper a hierarchical genotype classifier of clonal pathogens advances in typing methodologies have recently reformed the field of molecular_epidemiology of pathogens the falling cost of sequencing_technologies is creating a deluge of whole_genome sequencing_data that burdens bioinformatics resources and tool development in particular single_nucleotide in core gen omes of pathogens are recognized as the most important markers for inferring genetic_relationships because they are evolutionarily stable and amenable to high_throughput detection methods sequence_data will provide an excellent opportunity to extend our understanding of infectious_disease when the challenge of extracting knowledge from available sequence resources is met here we present an efficient and user_friendly genotype classification pipeline cansnper based on an easily expandable database of predefined canonical single_nucleotide availability_and all documentation and python based source_code for the cansnper are freely_available github com adrlar cansnper whole_genome of pathogen isolates will continue to improve epidemiological_investigations and microbial forensics through the ability to reconstruct genetic_relationships among isolates the vast amount of information generated by whole_genome can overcome the hurdles of other lessinformative rich epidemiological typing methods in establishing genetic_relationships among pathogens the overall goal is to identify similarities among strains that are a result of vertically inherited variation indicative of recent common descent confounding sources of polymorphisms must however be addressed including sequencing_errors and sequence_polymorphisms introduced through horizontal_transfer of sequences by both homologous and non homologous_recombination no single typing_method handles all levels of bacterial_diversity multilocus_sequence has been used for a decade as a portable sequence_based method for identifying clonal relationships among bacteria with various amount of recombination in highly monomorphic and slowly evolving bacterial_species such as mycobacterium_tuberculosis or bacillus_anthracis identification of single_nucleotide snps in comparison with a defined archetypal strain could provide more robust phylogeny and higher_resolution in such pathogens the inheritance pattern of specific sets of snps is strictly clonal several snp_detection technologies developed for this purpose over the past_decades e g based on real_time or microarrays are predicted to be replaced by next_generation for example relationships among isolates of francisella_tularensis coxiella_burnetii yersinia_pestis and b anthracis are amenable for characterization using specific sets of snps often denoted canonical snps cansnps it has been demonstrated that a small number of snps can be used to define genetic groups efficiently and to infer evolutionary_relationships within f tularensis c burnetii y pestis and b anthracis using the new low_cost sequencing_technology for snp_detection there are vast_amounts of data that can be used to characterize an isolate and its relationship with others wholegenome sequence typing is a powerful_tool for genotyping and molecular epidemiological_analysis but not completely accessible for scientists with limited computer skills the current bottleneck is time and computationally_intensive generation of high_quality genome_sequences to take advantage of the new low_cost sequencing_technology sequence_information must be presented and analyzed in a way that for example public_health experts in epidemiology can easily interpret therefore alternative_methods are needed for whole genome_sequence typing data to be used in real_time here we present an analysis_pipeline for easy genotype classification of clonal pathogens this program should have vast applications in clinical genomic_research and will aid the expanding efforts to identify and trace pathogens during outbreaks
