tipr transcription_initiation pattern_recognition on a genome_scale motivation the computational_identification of gene transcription_start tsss can provide insights into the regulation and function of genes without performing expensive experiments particularly in organisms with incomplete annotations high_resolution general_purpose tss prediction remains_a with little recent_progress on the identification and differentiation of tsss which are arranged in different spatial_patterns along the chromosome results in this work we present the transcription_initiation pattern recognizer tipr a sequence_based machine_learning model that identifies tsss with high_accuracy and resolution for multiple spatial distribution_patterns along the genome including broadly_distributed tss patterns that have previously been difficult to characterize tipr predicts not only the locations of tsss but also the expected spatial initiation pattern each tss will form along the chromosomea novel capability for tss prediction_algorithms as spatial initiation patterns are associated with spatiotemporal expression_patterns and gene function this capability has the potential to improve gene_annotations and our understanding of the regulation of transcription_initiation the high nucleotide_resolution of this model locates tsss within nucleotides or less on average availability_and model source_code is made available online attranscription start sites tsss and their associated promoter_regions play_a in the transcription of genes by rna_polymerase however the mechanisms by which transcription is initiated at specific genomic_locations is still not fully understood including how the spatial distribution of tsss is defined how promoter architecture influences this spatial_pattern and how genes lacking canonical elements within the core_promoter are transcribed the advent_of tss sequencing tss seq protocols such as cap_analysis cage and paired_end analysis of transcription_start peat have transformed the field of promoter analysis providing genome_wide nucleotide_resolution information on tss usage one important goal in this field is the identification of tss locations when tss seq data is unavailable while start_codons are easily_identified the length of the untranslated_region utr upstream of the first exon varies from gene to gene and even between transcripts of the same gene yielding different mrna products several studies have taken computational_approaches to tss identification building machine_learning that predict the location of tsss from the surrounding sequence content with varying_degrees of success and resolution ranging from the prediction at the level of individual nucleotides to regions up to nt wide v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com the mrna products produced during the transcription of genes typically do not all initiate at a single genomic location instead transcription initiates upstream of the genes start_codon in a region that can range from very narrow nt to wide upwards of nt or more forming a collection of individual tsss known as a tss cluster or transcription start region tsr tss clusters can be grouped by the shape of their positional distributionthat is the transcription_initiation patternof individual tsss that defines the cluster in this study we focus on the single peak or narrow peak and broad peak or weak peak patterns defined in previous tss seq studies previous_studies that different initiation patterns are associated with different types of genes tissues and regulatory_mechanisms such as transcription_factors tfs and cpg islands while there has been success in the identification of single peak initiation patterns it has remained_unclear whether other initiation patterns can be predicted from sequence content alone at the same nucleotide level resolution models incorporating additional data types such as histone_modifications have had success in the prediction of these less well defined patterns though prediction of broadly_distributed patterns is still clearly a greater challenge an analysis of tss prediction_models found that these broad patterns could be predicted with low_resolution nt from sequence content alone but did not explore nucleotide_resolution models in this work we present a machine_learning model capable of predicting tsss of multiple initiation patterns with high performance and positional resolution while also suggesting the probable initiation pattern that the tss cluster would form along the chromosome the transcription_initiation pattern_recognition tipr model utilizes features derived from sequence content and tf binding_affinity to predict the probability of transcription_initiation at an individual nucleotide because this model provides both nucleotide_resolution and initiation pattern prediction the model can be used to address a wide_variety of topics including a better understanding of promoter architecture improved gene_finding and annotations identification of tfs which could be involved in the regulation of genes and positional_information guiding wetlaboratory experiments we evaluate the tipr model using a publicly_available high_throughput tss seq dataset from mouse where it performs well achieving area under_the auroc of and area under the precision_recall curve auprc of tipr uses only sequence_information in predicting the location and type of tss initiation patterns and is therefore applicable in cases where tss seq data are not yet available tss prediction has many practical_applications including a potential for use in organisms with poorly_annotated genomes tipr requires only dna_sequence as input in order to make predictions and does not require any a priori_knowledge of gene_annotation the training of tipr does require tss seq data and through the training_process tipr identifies tf binding_profiles that are enriched at position specific locations with respect to the tsstf based features are then generated and the model learns which of these features are most useful in determining tss location for each peak type thus it is important that the species in which predictions are made is expected to share many orthologous tfs with the training species the earlier s peaker model showed that a model trained exclusively from mouse tsss could identify the tsss of human mirnas this ability provides a strong potential for informative cross_species application in sequenced_genomes of agronomic interestthese species may not yet have extensive high_throughput or even gene_annotations available but are often anticipated to share substantial tf binding_domain orthology with a model species in which tss seq information is available for example models trained in the dicot arabidopsis could be useful guides for further experiments on genes in crop species such as tomato predictions can be used to assist in the identification of the regulatory_networks controlling genes by identifying which tfbss are positioned in biologically_relevant locations relative to the predicted tss these models can also be used to identify potential alternative start sites and the regulators which may control them leading to the transcription of genes in different conditions or the transcription of different mrna products altogether many genes have been shown to have tissue_specific tsss and different regulatory_networks of tfs have been implicated in at least some of these genes another recent study showed a change in tss selection initiation pattern and tf usage during the transition from maternal to zygotic_transcription in zebra fish tss prediction_tools can be used to identify potential alternative tsss which can help guide wet_lab to validate sites and regulatory_networks the prediction of spatial tss initiation pattern along the genome can also provide insights into the nature of transcripts produced from the site for example it may suggest spatiotemporal expression that is more consistent with housekeeping functions or more consistent with tissue or time related functions the tipr model provides a large boost in performance increase in auprc over previous sequence_based models this is likely to be due in part to the use of a negative set filtering algorithm that selects locations with appropriately similar sequence backgrounds to tsss while excluding false_negatives another primary contributor to performance is an increased number of tfbs pwms the complete transfac dataset in vertebrates and the inclusion of new sequence enrichment features for example the model feature measuring the sequence enrichment of the ca di nucleotide not included in the s peaker model was highly negatively weighted implying that promoter_regions may be significantly depleted of ca in humans ca is known to be the most common simple_sequence motif with repeats occurring per mb several studies have shown that intronic ca repeats play a role in the regulation of alternative_splicing in some genes report that the ac motif is significantly depleted directly downstreamtranscription initiation pattern recognitionof human tsss but the same depletion is not seen in the entire promoter_region
