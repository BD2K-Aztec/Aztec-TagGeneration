fuzzy optimization for detecting enzyme targets of human uric_acid metabolism motivation mathematical_modeling and optimization have been used for detecting enzyme targets in human metabolic_disorders such optimal drug_design methods are generally differentiated as two stages identification and decision_making to find optimal targets we developed a unified method_named fuzzy equal metabolic adjustment to formulate an optimal enzyme target design problem for drug_discovery the optimization framework combines the identification of enzyme targets and a decision_making strategy simultaneously the objectives of this algorithm include evaluations of the therapeutic_effect of target_enzymes the adverse_effects of drugs and the minimum_effective med results an existing generalized mass action system model of human uric_acid ua metabolism was used to formulate the fuzzy optimization method for detecting two types of enzymopathies hyperuricemia caused by phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase prpps over activity and leschnyhan syndrome the fuzzy objectives were set so that the concentrations of the metabolites were as close as possible to the healthy levels the target design included a diet control of ribose phospahate r p the diet control of r p served as an extra remedy to reduce phosphate uptake entering the purine metabolic_pathway so that we could obtain a more satisfactory treatment than obtained for those without a diet control moreover enhancing ua excretion resulted in an effective treatment of hyperuricemia caused by prpps overactivity this result correlates with using pro benecid and benbromazone which are uricosuric agents present in current clinical medications by contrast the leschnyhan syndrome required at least three enzyme targets to cure hyperuricemia one of the most potentially valuable approaches used to accelerate the development of new drugs is through the simulation of human metabolic_disorders simulations involve the construction of mathematical_models that integrate genomic proteomic and metabolic information in mathematical_models parameters are manipulated to identify biomedical systems that have defective enzymes and mathematical optimization_methods are then applied to correct those systems one of the genetic causes of hyperuricemia is a functional_defect in phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase prpps which provokes an increase in the activity of this enzyme and promotes the metabolic_flux yielding uric_acid ua another instance of hyperuricemia is caused by a deficiency of the activity of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosy transferase hgprt leading to leschnyhan disease patients with hyperuricemia are at risk of nephropathy urinary_tract stone_disease gouty arthritis and tophaceous deposits in addition those with the leschnyhan disease also exhibit neurological_symptoms and self mutilating behavior the oxypurines hypoxanthine and xanthine xa accumulate in hgprt deficiency these oxypurines are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of the neurological_symptoms of leschnyhan disease because of their cytopathic_effects the current treatment of hyperuricemia usually includes a symptomatic treatment for joint_pain a restricted_diet in which foods with high purine concentrations are limited and the prescription of medications such as uricosuric agents and xa oxidase inhibitors that increase the excretion of ua in the urine and block ua production respectively the development of a new drug is a high_risk and costly activity involving multi criteria decision_making and trade_offs in a model based_approach systems biological data and optimization technologies are integrated to surmount these drawbacks guillen the optimization program for drug_design opdd is a two stage procedure used to identify enzyme targets for remedying hyperuricemia which is caused by prpps overactivity in the purine metabolic_pathway the first stage of the opdd is to enumerate each enzyme to identify a set of candidate enzyme targets that minimize the difference between a high concentration of ua and its healthy levels the purine metabolic_pathway was originally expressed using a generalized mass action gma model the gma model was first transformed into an s system model so that the opdd can be applied to a linear_programming method in solving the drug_target design problem to obtain a set of candidate enzyme targets the second stage of the opdd is a posterior decisionmaking determining a satisfactory target from the candidate enzyme targets three objectives therapeutic_effect adverse_effect and low_dose are considered to make the decision the therapeutic_effect objective consists of ensuring that each to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com candidate enzyme target is able to return the concentration of ua to of the healthy levels the adverse_effect objective consists of ensuring that the least square error between the remedied metabolite_concentration and its corresponding healthy levels is small furthermore the drug dose objective is based on the fact that higher enzyme_activities imply using a lower dose of drugs and low drug_doses minimize adverse_effects in this study we introduce a fuzzy multi_objective approach to formulate the enzyme target design problem for drug_discovery the design problem is a unified optimization framework in which the identification of enzyme targets is combined with multi criteria decision_making to identify enzyme targets for curing hyperuricemia caused by prpps overactivity and hgprt deficiency in this work we not only consider the therapeutic_effect and adverse_effect objectives but also the minimum_effective med to represent the low_dose objective the med is defined as the lowest dose level of a pharmaceutical product that provides a clinically_significant response with average efficacy and that is also significantly superior to the response provided by the placebo although fuzzy multi_objective approaches have been applied to the enzyme intervention problem metabolic_networks of microbe almost no literature has so_far discussed the approach for evaluating therapeutic_effect adverse_effect and med simultaneously to combine the detection of candidate enzyme targets and decision_making to select satisfactory targets we introduce fuzzy programming in which the detection of candidate enzyme targets is combined with decision_making strategies to create a unified optimization framework for determining satisfactory targets this optimal enzyme target design problem is indeed a multi criteria decision_making problem a multi_objective method can be generally applied to find the pareto front for this decision problem and such pareto solutions are provided for the designer using his her biological_knowledge to decide candidate enzyme targets almost no literature has so_far discussed the fuzzy equal operation in the fema problem to simultaneously evaluate therapeutic_effect adverse_effect and med furthermore the membership function defined in fuzzy programming can be referred to as an index for determining how to achieve satisfactory levels in the design the fema approach can also be applied for drug_development for other metabolic_diseases using multiple objectives enables managing various effects such as therapeutic_effects adverse_effects and med and the weighting factor for each objective in a unified optimization framework the objectives in the fema framework can be compromised to obtain a satisfactory result furthermore the concentrations of metabolites in the human_body are not fixed but fluctuate within normal ranges as a result boundaries for each objective and constraint are not sharply defined fuzzy programming has the advantage of enabling the management of these flexible conditions
