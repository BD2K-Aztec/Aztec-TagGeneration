sequence_analysis maxalike maximum likelihood_based sequence reconstruction with application to improved primer_design for unknown sequences motivation the task of reconstructing a genomic_sequence from a particular species is gaining more and more importance in the light of the rapid development_of and their limitations applications include not only compensation for missing_data in unsequenced genomic_regions and the design of oligonucleotide_primers for target_genes in species with lacking sequence_information but also the preparation of customized queries for homology_searches results we introduce the maxalike algorithm which reconstructs a genomic_sequence for a specific taxon based on sequence homologs in other species the input is a multiple_sequence and a phylogenetic_tree that also contains the target species for this target species the algorithm computes nucleotide probabilities at each sequence position consensus_sequences are then reconstructed based on a certain confidence_level for out of target species in a test_dataset we obtain a significant increase of the reconstruction_accuracy compared to both the consensus_sequence from the alignment and the sequence of the nearest phylogenetic neighbor when considering only nucleotides above a confidence limit maxalike is significantly better up to in all species the improved sequence reconstruction also leads to an increase of the quality of pcr primer_design for yet unsequenced genes the differences between the expected t m and real t m of the primer template duplex can be reduced by compared with other reconstruction approaches we also show that the prediction_accuracy is robust to common distortions of the input trees the prediction_accuracy drops by only on average across all species for of trees derived from random genomic_loci in a test_dataset availability maxalike is available for download and web_server at with increased opportunities for high_throughput a large number of additional genomes will be sequenced in the near future given the limitations of these sequencing_technologies however it is likely that routinely produced genomic_sequences will be incomplete at various levels also the genomic_information for less popular model_organisms or economically_important species might remain unavailable for a long time it is still essential to infer as much knowledge as possible about incomplete or missing genomic_data in relation to specific analyses such as studying the distribution of gene_families across the phylogeny of species the relative_position of the target species in the evolutionary tree is typically known or can be inferred from the partial sequence_information that is already available with the rapidly_growing collection of sequence_data from diverse organisms homologs for a certain region of interest can be utilized together with their inherent pattern of evolutionary variation we present an algorithmmaxalikethat aims at reconstructing sequences in a particular target species based on a species phylogeny and sequence homologs from other species the maxalike algorithm uses a multiple_sequence and a corresponding phylogenetic_tree annotated with phylogenetic distances on the branches to estimate mutation_rates for each alignment column it then infers nucleotide probabilities for each site in the theoretical homologous_sequence in the target species from the estimated nucleotide probabilities the entire_sequence can be reconstructed given a certain level of confidence the reconstructed sequence can then be utilized for several applications the sensitivity_and of homology search_methods that are based either on primary sequence alone or on profile alignment_algorithms can be increased by employing a search query that is optimized for the target species of the homology_search a very important application of partially reconstructed sequences is the design of oligonucleotide_primers for a pcr experiment e g for analysis of expression of the targeted re sequencing of a particular region that is not or incompletely represented in a genome_assembly the successful amplification of a gene sequence depends on a careful_selection of a pair of short primers which besides certain thermodynamic_properties page the maxalike algorithm estimates the nucleotide probabilities at each sequence position for an unknown sequence in a target species using a combination of homology_information from a multiple_sequence and a phylogenetic_tree the calculated nucleotide probabilities can be used for homology_search or for reconstruction of sequences on which primer_design can be made in a benchmark_dataset we demonstrated that the inclusion of phylogenetic_information in sequence reconstruction significantly_improves the reconstruction_accuracy compared with two standard_approaches for the comparison to the first standard approach frequency based consensus_sequences the maxalike reconstruction rate is up to higher in most target species when using a suitable probability threshold taking the closest available phylogenetic neighbor the second standard approach as a prediction for the target species yields poor results in many cases and is often worsepage
