integrating different data types by regularized unsupervised multiple_kernel with application to cancer subtype discovery motivation despite ongoing cancer research available therapies are still limited in quantity and effectiveness and making_treatment for individual patients remains a hard problem established subtypes which help guide these decisions are mainly based on individual data types however the analysis of multidimensional patient data involving the measurements of various molecular_features could reveal intrinsic characteristics of the tumor large_scale projects accumulate this kind of data for various cancer_types but we still lack the computational_methods to reliably integrate this information in a meaningful manner therefore we apply and extend current multiple_kernel for dimensionality_reduction approaches on the one hand we add a regu larization term to avoid_overfitting during the optimization procedure and on the other hand we show that one can even use several kernels per data type and thereby alleviate the user from having to choose the best kernel functions and kernel parameters for each data type beforehand results we have identified biologically_meaningful subgroups for five different cancer_types survival analysis has revealed significant differences between the survival_times of the identified subtypes with p values comparable or even better than state of the art methods moreover our resulting subtypes reflect combined patterns from the different data_sources and we demonstrate that input kernel matrices with only little information have less impact on the integrated kernel_matrix our subtypes show different responses to specific_therapies which could eventually assist in treatment decision_making availability_and an executable is available upon request cancer is not only a very aggressive but also a very diverse disease therefore a number of approaches aim to identify subtypes of cancer in a specific tissue where subtypes refer to groups of patients with corresponding biological_features or a correlation in a clinical_outcome e g survival time or response to treatment nowadays most of these methods utilize single data types e g gene_expression however subtypes that are merely based on information from one level can hardly capture the subtleties of a tumor therefore huge efforts are made to improve the comprehensive understanding of tumorigenesis in the different tissue_types large_scale projects e g the cancer_genome tcga provide a massive amount of data generated by diverse platforms such as gene_expression dna_methylation and copy_number data for various cancer_types still we require computational_methods that enable the comprehensive analysis of these multidimensional data and the reliable integration of information generated from different sources one simple and frequently_applied method to combine biological data consists of clustering the samples using each data type separately and subsequently integrating the different cluster assignments the latter step can be performed either manually or automatically e g using consensus clustering manual integration tends to be biased leading to inconsistent results however both manual and automatic integration cannot capture correlated information between the data types because low signals might v c the author published_by
