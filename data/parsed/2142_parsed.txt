gsp a web_based for designing genome specific_primers in polyploids motivation the sequences among subgenomes in a polyploid species have high similarity making_it to design genome specific_primers for sequence_analysis results we present gsp a web_based to design genome specific_primers that distinguish subgenome sequences in a polyploid genome gsp uses blast to extract homeologous sequences of the subgenomes in existing databases performs a multiple_sequence and design primers based on sequence_variants in the alignment an interactive primers diagram a sequence_alignment viewer and a virtual electrophoresis are displayed as parts of the primer_design result gsp also designs specific_primers from multiple_sequences uploaded by users availability_and gsp is a user_friendly and efficient web platform freely_accessible atdeveloping genome specific_primers for polyploids not only will facilitate the study of sequence_diversity and the association_mapping of genes but also the development of gene based functional markers however the polyploid genome contains two or more homeologous subgenomes with high sequence_similarities especially in the coding_regions which presents a particular problem with respect to the design genomespecific primers that amplify individual genes to our knowledge only one pipeline named polymarker can generate genome specific_primers however plolymarker was specifically developed for snp assay with the kasp tm kompetitive allele_specific system a very unique system using a three primers system in pcr_reactions polymarker requires users to prepare sequence files with snp information and the target chromosome input therefore the software has limited utility in a variety of other pcr based applications ma et_al described a method for detecting locus specific polymorphism in hexaploid wheat in this method users are required to do step_wise processes using provided multiple perl scripts for blast_search extracting homeologous sequences local_alignment among the retrieved sequences to identify polymorphism sites however users still need to manually design primers based on the alignment currently no good web_based is available that allows the user to design genome specific_primers by only inputting a query_sequence here we present a web_based userfriendly primer_design tool named gsp which employs a blast_search and multiple_sequence msa to identifysequence variant sites among the homeologous sequences retrieved and then designs specific_primers the gsp web platform provides a user_friendly graphical view that displays primer_design output the main results of the gsp analysis are msa of the homeologous sequences supplemental a distribution of primers and products supplemental a detail of the primers information supplemental and a primer_pair pool panel that contains the selected primer_pairs supplemental gsp provides an interactive view for selecting and analyzing primers users can easily find their primers of interest obtain the sequence products and generate a virtual electrophoresis gel gsp also allows users to manually select a specific region of a sequence in the alignment to verify its use as a good primer in addition gsp can check the specificity of primers input by users we designed primer_pairs for group homoeologous chromosomes for hexaploid wheat and tested their genome specificity using pcr assays a total of primers showed genome specificity and identified a b and d genome homoeologs supplementaland supplemental with the rapid increase of polyploid genome sequence_data from highthroughput sequencing_technologies effective primer design_tools for homeologous sequences from the subgenomes of polyploids has become an important component of gene and genome_analysis gsp is a time saving user_friendly and easy to use web_tool for designing genome specific_primers to distinguish sequences among the subgenomes of polyploid species this web_application tool can be easily extended to other polyploids when their genome_sequences become available
