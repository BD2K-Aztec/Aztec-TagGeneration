genetics_and svamp sequence_variation analysis maps and phylogeny svamp is a stand alone desktop_application to visualize genomic_variants in variant_call in the context of geographical metadata users of svamp are able to generate phylogenetic_trees and perform principal coordinate analysis in real_time from variant_call vcf and associated metadata files allele_frequency map geographical map of isolates tajimas d metric single_nucleotide density gc and variation density are also available for visualization in real_time we demonstrate the utility of svamp in tracking a methicillin_resistant outbreak from published next_generation data across countries we also demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of our software on plasmodium_falciparum isolates from three continents availability_and the qt c software code bin aries user_manual and example datasets are available at http cbrc associating sequence_variants single_nucleotide snps and indels with sample metadata such as geographical_location and drug_susceptibility have played_a in studying the population_structure identifying mechanisms of drug_resistance and tracking the transmission of an infectious_disease with the increasing application of deep_sequencing as an approach the number and volume of population studies with geo biological_information and associated genomic_data will continue to grow this increases the demand for tools to integrate visualize and analyse complex genomic epidemiological_data in real_time including browsing genome_variation patterns and assessing population_structure or geo phylogeny although software such as polylens and gengis can integrate geographical and genetic sequence_data there is a need to scale up to whole genome_variation in the standardized vcf format with informative population genetic_analysis this motivated us to develop svamp a stand alone qt c application capable of analysing variants in the context of geography and aiding in making inferences on the population_structure svamp is built on the open_source varb we have evaluated the application and scalability of svamp using two published datasets i a bacterial_population study on methicillin_resistant commonly known as mrsa and ii a worldwide to whom correspondence should be addressed
