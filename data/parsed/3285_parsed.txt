data_and norse noise_reduction and state evaluator for high_frequency single_event traces norse was developed to analyze high_frequency datasets collected from multistate dynamic experiments such as molecular adsorption and desorption onto carbon_nanotubes as technology improves sampling_frequency these stochastic datasets become increasingly_large with faster dynamic events more efficient algorithms are needed to accurately locate the unique states in each time trace norse adapts and optimizes a previously_published noise_reduction algorithm and uses a custom peak flagging routine to rapidly_identify unique event states the algorithm is explained using experimental_data from our lab and its fitting accuracy and efficiency are then shown with a generalized model of stochastic datasets the algorithm is compared to another recently_published state finding algorithm and is found to be times_faster and more accurate over of the generalized experimental space norse is written as an m file for matlab as stochastic biological studies are preformed at increasingly smaller length and time scales the analysis of large noisy datasets is becoming an increasingly common problem in our laboratory these sets consist of time traces gathered from monitoring the fluorescence of single_walled swnt based_sensors as target_molecules bind to a single sensor the fluorescence is quenched in a stepwise manner resulting in unique fluorescent states that correspond to the number of bound sites along the length of the nanotube although norse was created with our fluorescence datasets in mind the algorithm can be readily applied to other analogous biological_experiments that contain event states this is demonstrated by an error analysis of generalized stochastic traces as shown below to whom correspondence should be addressed
