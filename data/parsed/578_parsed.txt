sequence_analysis a unified index of sequence quality and contig overlap for dna_barcoding barcode quality index b is a novel unified measure of sequence quality and contig overlap tailored to the needs of dna_barcoding re analysis of published_data demonstrates the utility of b dna_barcoding is an emerging enterprise that aims to build a reference_database of high_quality dna_sequences generated from expert identified vouchered specimens once populated the reference_database will allow non specialists to easily_identify specimens by sequencing a standard set of markers unfortunately low quality sequences may obscure subtle differences among specimens resulting in inaccurate identification the barcode data standard governs the quality and type of sequences archived as references quality is assessed through a combination of base caller error probabilities sequence_coverage and contig size for example a reference coi sequence should contain at least bp of contiguous sequence within the reference region have bidirectional coverage and have error probabilities of or smaller assigned to at least of its bases q log p for nearly fixedlength markers a threshold for each variable can be effectively employed in contrast the application of absolute thresholds particularly contig sizeto variable_length markers results in severe distortion some of this distortion can be ameliorated by the use of contig size for normalization but distortion persists in extremely_long or short_sequences due to dependance among variables there is a strong_positive between the number or percent of low quality bases and contig size while at the same there is a strong negative correlation between sequence_coverage and contig size the criteria for selecting barcode markers must include a comparison of sequence quality among candidate markers to accomplish this the cbol plant working group generated a set of sequences for each marker a set of trimming and assembly criteria were applied and the numbers of passing contigs for each marker were compared although markers lacking adequate sequence quality were recognized statistically_significant differences in quality among markers could not be identified cbol plant working group dna_barcoding needs a distortion free index that combines measures of sequence quality with contig size and overlap such an index must be amenable to statistical_analysis and comparable among sequences markers and editing protocols this will enable uniform quality_evaluation of newly_generated sequencesparticularly those of variable_length markers to avoid conflating pcr success with sequence quality the de_novo sequence traces generated by the cbol plant workingwere re tabulated excluding presumed pcr failures i e read failure of both primers in addition the data were reanalyzed using b the original base calls and quality values kb were extracted with tracetuner http sourceforge net_projects tracetuner and trimmed and filtered as described in the original publication presumed pcr failures were excluded contigs were assembled with phrap http www phrap org muscle was used to align the contig to the trimmed reads in order to determine observed contig length c excluding phrap induced trimming non overlapping contigs were assumed for single or paired_reads that could not be assembled into contigs i e c the combined length of the trimmed reads statistical differences in sequence quality among markers were examined using the method of scheff at p the binomial and gaussian_distributions were used for the re tabulated and b analyses respectively r mass agricolae http cran r project org the most striking_differences between the published and re tabulated analyses are a increase in re tabulated scores and a rank_order rearrangement of b c and m given the published trimming and assembly criteria the minimum b score for a passing contig in the re tabulated analysis is assuming a gaussian quality distribution scores above the minimum reflect a greater number of high_quality bases or additional contig overlap although the re tabulated and b analyses are very similar they are not perfectly correlated mean b for non coding markersa k and pis higher than the minimum passing score whereas coding markers are higher the inclusion of non overlapping contigs depressed mean b for coding and for non coding markers neither the published nor retabulated analyses could identify any statistically distinctive groups of markers whereas the b analysis was able to identify four distinct groups the increased statistical resolution of the b analysis can be attributed to the ability to use more powerful statistical distributions and a reduction in variation within markers thus b provides a more nuanced resolved and statistically amenable measure of sequencing success that considers both sequence quality and contig coverage
