data_and args oap online analysis_pipeline for antibiotic_resistance detection from metagenomic_data using an integrated structured arg database motivation environmental dissemination of antibiotic_resistance args has become an increasing concern for public_health metagenomics approaches can effectively detect broad profiles of args in environmental_samples however the detection and subsequent classification of arg like sequences are time consuming and have been severe obstacles in employing metagenomic methods we sought to accelerate quantification of args in metagenomic_data from environmental_samples results a structured arg reference_database sarg was constructed by integrating ardb and card the two most commonly used databases sarg was curated to remove redundant sequences and optimized to facilitate query_sequence identification by similarity a database with a hierarchical_structure type subtype reference_sequence was then constructed to facilitate classification assigning arg like sequence to type subtype and reference_sequence of sequences identified through similarity_search utilizing sarg and a previously_proposed hybrid functional gene annotation_pipeline we developed an online pipeline called args oap for fast annotation and classification of arg like sequences from metagenomic_data we also evaluated and proposed a set of criteria important for efficiently conducting metagenomic_analysis of args using args oap availability_and perl script for args oap can be downloaded from https github com biofuture ublastx stageone args oap can be accessed through http smile hku hk sargs the prevalence of antibiotic_resistance args and the escalating threats they pose to public_health have attracted worldwide concern a growing number of organizations and governments have enhanced their monitoring of antibiotic_resistant and args the world_health initiated a global surveillance of antibiotic_resistance in countries with their first surveillance report released in april the public_health agency of canada also provided a year surveillance report on antibiotic_resistant organisms inreleased a note titled antibiotic_resistance in the environment and the u s white house issued an executive order on national strategy for combating antibiotic_resistance along with concerns about antibiotic_resistance in clinical_settings there has been increased interest in args in the environment args have been detected in soil natural_waters and sediments where they are potentially transferable from host_bacteria to pathogens by horizontal_gene args are now regarded as emerging pollutants and their dissemination in the environment has attracted much media attention recently metagenomic approaches have been applied to the investigation of args in environmental_samples studied the occurrence and abundance of args in environmental_samples their results revealed the diversity and abundance of args in different environments and suggested these genes were not randomly_distributed a study byshowed the influence of anthropogenic_activities on the distribution of args in samples from different environments through network_analysis they proposed tetm and genes coding aminoglycoside_resistance as indicators that can be used to quantify other co occurring args a more comprehensive investigation of the diversity and abundance of args in various environments would provide insight into the distribution pattern of args the influence of human activity and the effectiveness of intervention or stewardship programs any large_scale environmental analysis for args by metagenomic_sequencing of environmental_samples requires an appropriate analysis method as well as a reference_database several databases and analysis_pipelines have been constructed specifically for arg analysis such as the antibiotic_resistance database ardb the comprehensive antibiotic_resistance database card resfinder antibiotic_resistance gene online argo and arg annot argo focuses on vancomycin and beta_lactam resistance genes while arg annot was designed to detect args in bacterial_genomes instead of environmental_samples resfinder offers arg detection functions but needs longer query reads for a sequence to be detected as an arg in resfinder it must cover at least two fifths of the length of the matching arg in the database with no less than identity ardb and card together provide most of the publicly_available arg sequences they are the two most commonly used reference_databases in the investigation of args in environmental_samples nevertheless ardb and card provide only limited online analysis capabilities for metagenomic_data moreover neither database can provide detailed arg profiles for environmental_samples i e classifications of the identified args like sequences and abundance information for each detected arg type subtype which makes_it for users to interpret the search results from the huge metagenomic_data here we describe our efforts in developing a structured arg database sarg by integrating sequences from ardb and card in a hierarchical_structure type subtype reference_sequence using sarg arg like sequences obtained from similarity_searches can be automatically assigned into different types and subtypes avoiding tedious manual classification furthermore an online analysis_pipeline args oap is available using sarg this pipeline allows users to determine arg profiles from large_numbers of environmental_samples in a single run the pipeline aims to exploit the power of metagenomic_analysis for better understanding the distribution and dissemination of args in different environments the time required for the similarity_search and the post alignment analysis has become the limiting_factor in metagenomic_studies as sequencing_costs decrease and data sizes grow the major_goal of the present study was to provide an online platform to shorten the time required for the detection of args and to improve the classification and enumeration of arg like sequences by constructing a structured database first after removing redundant sequences the ardb and card databases were integrated to provide more comprehensive detection of arg like sequences in metagenomic_data which will increase the accuracy and completeness of arg profiles from environmental_samples with diverse microbial_communities since the search time is dependent on the size of reference_database removing redundant sequences in the two reference_databases was an obvious way to reduce the search time without compromising the completeness of the reference_database second a structured database was established for the integrated database following our previous idea of a structured ardb this structured database made automatic classification of different arg types and subtypes possible therefore manual classification is no longer needed third the online analysis platform args oap was developed for arg detection applying our previous proposed hybrid_approach using ublast and blastx for arg annotation of metagenomic sequence_data the pre screening of potential arg sequences could filter out most for args more than irrelevant sequences and significantly_shorten the required time for the blastx process on the online platform moreover the classification of the identified arg like sequences was conducted automatically using sarg which will greatly reduce the required time for post alignment processing and automatic generation of pcoa from args oap may help users with a rapid assessment of differences between the arg profiles in their samples and in other reference environmental_samples given the less biased nature of metagenomic_datasets utilizing the args oap different research groups may compare their datasets in a way that is more consistent than other current approaches and that can help reveal the distribution of args in different environments args oap also supports analysis under different criteria i e evalue hit length and identity if the user wishes these criteria can be adjusted according to their specific requirements via a platform interface instead of using the default setting i e e value of e hit length of of read_length i e aa for reads of bp and identity of our evaluation indicates that the completeness of the database is critical for the comprehensive annotation of args in metagenomic_data by similarity_search it is likely that inclusion of additional novel arg sequences would improve performance the current database of sarg was constructed from the two most widely_applied databases i e ardb and card version on april it is clear that our integrated structured database does not cover all arg sequences although it already contains most arg sequences available in public database thus as for other gene types updates with new sequences will be important as they become available moreover annotation evaluation should be repeated when new args sequences are added in the database to achieve accurate annotation for the args profiles in metagenomic_data we believe this pipeline is a powerful method for more comprehensive arg profiles assessment from metagenomic_data and hence lead to methods to reduce arg dissemination to the environment and its dissemination to pathogens
