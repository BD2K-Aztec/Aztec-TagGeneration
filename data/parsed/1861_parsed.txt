systems_biology fnv light_weight flash based network and pathway viewer motivation network diagrams are commonly used to visualize biochemical_pathways by displaying the relationships between genes proteins mrnas micrornas metabolites regulatory_dna diseases viruses and drugs while there are several currently available web_based pathway viewers there is still room for improvement to this end we have developed a flash based network viewer fnv for the visualization of small to moderately sized biological_networks and pathways summary written in adobe actionscript the viewer accepts simple extensible markup_language xml formatted input_files to display pathways in vector_graphics on any web_page providing flexible layout options interactivity with the user through tool tips hyperlinks and the ability to rearrange nodes on the screen fnv was utilized as a component in several web_based systems namely genes networks lists networks kea chea and pathwaygenerator in addition fvn can be used to embed pathways inside pdf files for the communication of pathways in soft publication materials availability fnv is available for use and download along with the supporting documentation and sample networks atpathway databases such kegg biocarta http www biocarta com wikipathways science signaling connection maps and ucsdnature signaling gateway communicate over the web cell_signaling transcriptional and metabolic_pathways as diagrams made of nodes and links such diagrams are visualized using different layout algorithms embedded in network viewers implemented with a variety of technologies the majority of webbased network viewers make use of the java web technologies for example patikaweb uses java server pages jsp to retrieve information_stored in the manually_curated patika database or passed through a file to generate pathway diagrams using a force directed algorithm to arrange static images of nodes and edges tools such as webinterviewer and visant are useful for large protein_protein utilizing javawebstart however javawebstart runs in a sandbox and does not easily communicate to whom correspondence should be addressed with the browser other tools such as jsquid are powerful but since they utilize java applets they are slow to start and are inconsistent across browsers several webbased pathway viewers have been implemented without the use of java for example celldesigner used by kegg creates static network images with hyperlinks it was used for example by biopp with perl and cgi displaying static images with annotations mapped to the nodes as hyperlinks avis a network drawing tool that we developed uses asynchronous javascript and xml ajax and underlying perl libraries to draw static networks that are rendered using graphviz graphviz is one of the most commonly used graph drawing tools for displaying pathways written in c graphviz takes text_files as input to render nodes and links for generating a static network image that can be saved in different formats i e scalable_vector svg jpeg png gif or as a postscript file while network images can be mapped to hyperlinks such mapping lacks interactivity such as panning and zooming or movement of nodes and links with the mouse by the user svg can be made interactive but is not universally supported across browsers and is a fading technology although somewhat limited graphviz has been widely used by leading pathway_databases to display their pathways online for example science signaling connection maps and ucsdnature signaling gateway databases use svg diagrams created with graphviz wikipathways and biocarta on the other hand use static images drawn by hand the static images in wikipathways are created manually with pathvisio a tool that is a part of genmapp recently a light_weight flash network viewer fnv for web_applications called cytoscape_web was launched this viewer provides a variety of dynamic_features the use of vector_graphics provided through flash makes the implementation much more responsive and sharp looking with cytoscape web uploaded pathways can be altered without changing the input_file whereas a javascript application_programming api is provided to alter uploaded networks
