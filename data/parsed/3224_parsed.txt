net ge a web_server for network based human gene enrichment motivation gene enrichment is a requisite for the interpretation of biological_complexity related to specific molecular_pathways and biological_processes furthermore when interpreting ngs_data and human variations including those related to pathologies gene enrichment allows the inclusion of other genes that in the human interactome space may also play important key roles in the emergency of the phenotype here we describe net ge a web_server for associating biological_processes and pathways to sets of human proteins involved in the same phenotype results net ge is based on proteinprotein_interaction following the notion that for a set of proteins the context of their specific interactions can better define their function and the processes they can be related to in the biological_complexity of the cell our method is suited to extract statistically validated enriched terms from gene_ontology kegg and reactome annotation databases furthermore net ge is effective even when the number of input proteins is small availability_and net ge web_server is publicly_available and accessible at http net ge biocomp unibo it enrich big_data production in biomedicine is rapidly_changing the way in which molecular knowledge is translated into health_care the spread and establishment of high_throughput hts technologies allows retrieving lists of interesting variations characterizing the investigated phenotype in the context of functional_genomics each phenotype needs annotations for reconciling variations with known and putatively common biological_processes and pathways such as gene_ontology kegg based on the extraction of subnetworks connecting proteins that share the same functional terms from a proteinprotein_interaction ppi_network differently from other methods also based on networks our approach extracts modules that are function specific by constructions and include all the seeds proteins annotated with the same term that in the ppi_network are related to a specific functional_annotation one peculiarity of net ge is the possibility to enrich terms that are not present in the annotation of the starting protein set and thus not detectable through a standard enrichment when tested on the omim derived benchmark sets net ge is able to enrich sets of genes related to the same disease with biologically_meaningful terms neglected by other methods the server in addition allows annotation based on kegg and reactome pathways and a comparison between standard and network based enrichment tion term we collect the seeds and evaluate the quality of the connecting nodes among seeds for more details see supplementary after constraining seed distance we determine the subset associated to a specific annotation term by retaining the minimal connecting subnetwork considering string net ge presently includes annotation subsets see http net ge biocomp unibo it enrich statistics of which contain from two to genes the number of genes per subset is inversely proportional to the information content and the most informative terms correspond to small networks the server implements both a standard and a network based gene enrichment given a gene protein list each gene protein is located in the different subsets of the annotation database with a fishers_exact the method estimates the overrepresentation significance of input genes proteins in each precomputed subset for the corresponding annotation term standard enrichment includes only annotations of seed nodes network based enrichment includes seeds and their connecting nodes for multiple_testing we use both the bonferroni and the benjamini hochberg false_discovery fdr procedures and evaluate a corrected p value updating of the system including human interactome and annotation databases is planned once a year following the major releases
