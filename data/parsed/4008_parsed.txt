gene_expression ribotools a galaxy toolbox for qualitative ribosome_profiling analysis motivation ribosome_profiling provides genome_wide information about translational regulation however there is currently no standard tool for the qualitative_analysis of ribo seq data we present here ribotools a galaxy toolbox for the analysis of ribosome_profiling ribo seq data it can be used to detect translational ambiguities stop_codon readthrough events and codon occupancy it provides a large number of plots for the visualisation of these events translation fidelity is essential for the correct decoding of genetic_information however translation fidelity is not maximal and several genes use alternative_mechanisms to regulate their expression such recoding events are difficult to identify by bioinformatics_methods and their incorrect annotation in databases is still frequent genome_wide translational analyses such as ribosome_profiling can identify many features affecting translational quality such as ribosomal pauses dual coding_regions translation start sites at aug or non aug codons or unconventional translational decoding events the translation of non coding rna and translational ambiguities ribosome_profiling has been widely_adopted by the scientific_community because it has revolutionised the ways in which translation can be studied it can be used for both quantitative and qualitative_analyses of translation quantitative analysis is carried_out with standard rna_seq scripts and is easy to implement an online genome_browser is also available for the visualisation of many ribosome_profiling data however qualitative_analysis is much more challenging because there is no standard analysis technique available correct analysis requires the development of specific scripts as most publications describe only briefly the way in which the data should be analysed a better standardization of ribosome_profiling approaches is urgently_needed to limit misinterpretations we describe here ribotools an efficient galaxy package that can be used for primary analyses of ribo seq data and to address common issues such as the identification of translational ambiguities or of stop_codon readthrough events and the codon occupancy of ribosomal a p and e sites ribotools provides user_friendly publication grade graphical results html report scripts are available from the galaxy bioinformatics platform via toolshed ribotools will be useful to the research_community as it facilitates the complete qualitative_analysis of ribosome_profiling data
