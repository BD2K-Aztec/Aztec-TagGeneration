systems_biology metpa a web based_metabolomics tool for pathway analysis and visualization metpa metabolomics pathway analysis is a user_friendly web_based dedicated to the analysis and visualization of metabolomic_data within the biological_context of metabolic_pathways metpa combines several advanced pathway_enrichment procedures along with the analysis of pathway topological characteristics to help identify the most relevant metabolic_pathways involved in a given metabolomic study the results are presented in a google map style network_visualization system that supports intuitive and interactive data exploration through point and click dragging and lossless zooming additional features include a comprehensive compound library for metabolite name conversion automatic generation of analysis report as well as the implementation of various univariate statistical_procedures that can be accessed when users click on any metabolite node on a pathway map metpa currently enables analysis and visualization of metabolic_pathways covering common model_organisms availability freely_available over the past_decade pathway analysis has emerged as an invaluable aid to understanding the data generated from various omics_technologies as a result a number of robust software_tools have been developed to support pathway analysis for genomics and proteomics_studies these tools combine powerful statistical_analysis with visualization capacities to help researchers identify significant pathways involved in the conditions under study the first pathway analysis tools were typically designed to take a list of differentially_expressed or gene_products and compare the number of differentially_expressed detected in each pathway of interest with the number of genes expected to be found in the given pathway just by chancea procedure known as over representation analysis second generation pathway analysis tools typically use normalized gene_expression data to calculate the expression of biological_pathways in association with phenotypesa procedure generally known as gene_set gsea more recent tools consider both the significance of gene_expression changes to whom correspondence should be addressed and their topological characteristics in order to better evaluate their impact on the pathways of interest to date essentially all pathway analysis tools have been designed and developed for the analysis of genomic or proteomic_data but not metabolomic_data here we wish to introduce metpa metabolomics pathway analysis a dedicated pathway analysis and visualization_tool to facilitate the use of these relatively new and powerful_methods in metabolomic_studies
