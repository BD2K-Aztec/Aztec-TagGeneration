famann an automated variant annotation_pipeline to facilitate target discovery for family based sequencing studies famann is an automated variant annotation_pipeline designed for facilitating target discovery for family based sequencing studies it can apply a different inheritance pattern or a de_novo mutations discovery model to each family and select single_nucleotide and small insertions_and segregating in each family or shared by multiple families it also provides a variety of variant annotations and retains and annotates all transcripts hit by a single_variant excel compatible outputs including all annotated variants segregating in each family or shared by multiple families will be provided for users to prioritize variants based on their customized thresholds a list of genes that harbor the segregating variants will be provided as well for possible pathway network_analyses famann uses the de facto community standard variant_call as the input format and can be applied to whole exome genome or targeted_resequencing data recent_advances in dna_sequencing have led to a resurgence of family_based for the discovery of genetic_variants in particular single_nucleotide and small insertions_and harbored in causal_genes that underlie mendelian and complex_diseases by sequencing exomes or genomes of selected individuals from families a handful of diseasecausing or associated genes have been identified the number of families selected in each study can vary from one to several hundreds and each family or group of families may follow a different inheritance pattern moreover the sequenced individuals from each family may be present as trios or extended pedigrees as a result an easy to use automated pipeline would be beneficial for systematically selecting variants segregating in each family and investigating variants shared across families as well as annotating variants to facilitate users customized prioritization for target discovery a number of open_source tools supplementary have been developed for annotating and prioritizing variants but few of them can compare multiple families simultaneously to identify variants recurrently present across families most of the current_tools do not provide an easy to use output so that users can prioritize variants or genes based on their customized thresholds here we present famann an automated variant annotation_pipeline designed for facilitating disease variants or genes discovery for family based sequencing studies the advantages of our pipeline are severalfold it selects and annotates variants segregating in each family and shared across families families with different inheritance patterns can be analyzed simultaneously by indicating the corresponding genetic model in the metadata file a model for de_novo mutations discovery is provided as well for users who are interested in identifying de_novo mutations in trio studies it is easy to use and one perl command is sufficient to generate excel compatible outputs that retain all annotated variants users with limited bioinformatics skills can apply various thresholds such as allele_frequency cutoffs directly on the output to prioritize variants when a variant hits multiple_transcripts and hence may have different types of functional effects it outputs all the effects for the same variant to avoid missing critical biological_information we provide functionalities offered by different bioinformatics resources such as encode annotation frequency checking in public_databases pathogenicity prediction and conservation scores finally famann can be applied to all types of sequencing_data such as whole_exome genome_sequencing or targeted_resequencing and can be used to annotate and prioritize any variant_calls generated in the de facto community standard variant_call vcf or variant effect predictor vep annotated vcf files as inputs where each line corresponds to one genetic_variant with annotated genomic location and coding effect multiple genetic_models are provided for selecting variants segregating in each family such as autosomal_dominant and recessive there is also a model for de_novo mutation discovery for trio studies in addition a general model that identifies variants shared by affected_individuals but absent in unaffected individuals is provided for users who do not want to make any genetic assumption famann will generate an excel compatible output that lists all variants shared by multiple families and variants segregated in each family if the total number of variants is million we will split the file into subsets of million variants so that each subset can be analyzed in excel famann will also generate a list of genes in text format which includes all the genes harboring variants shown in the variant output_file users can use this list as an input for possible pathway or network_analyses such as input for ingenuity pathways analysis in the variant output_file a variety of annotations are provided for each variant for example loss of function mutation annotation is provided based on snpeff function_annotation prediction compound_heterozygous in the affected_individuals are identified in the trio studies to identify variants in regulatory_regions such as enhancers or promoters famann retrieves encode annotations by using histone_modification tracks obtained from university of california santa_cruz table browser such as mono and tri methylation of histone h lysine h_k h_k and acetylation of histone h lysine h k ac in addition to histone_modification annotation famann also marks variants that fall in the predicted enhancers by using the dnasei hypersensitivity track dnase clusters to facilitate prioritizing variants based on their allele_frequencies in public_databases famann extracts variant frequencies from the genomes_project http www genomes org and exome variant server http evs gs washington edu evs to predict whether a variant is in a duplicated region defined by the segmental_duplication track obtained in the university of california santa_cruz table browser famann marks it as yes in the segmental dups column in the output_file if the variant is present in a duplicated region to predict protein disruption and conservation famann uses the dbnsfp database to aggregate scores of sift polyphen lrt mutationtaster gerp phylop and siphy in the common output_file therefore users may prioritize their variants in excel using the variant output_file and customized filtering procedures such as the recurrent frequency of the variant present in multiple families the cutoff of allele_frequency in the genomes_project or mutation_type of each variant to facilitate the use of our pipeline all the input datasets and the annotation tracks will be stored in one directory to run famann in the same directory users need to generate a metadata file in text format to include the family ids and sequenced individual ids and their affected status and the model they want to apply to each family the detailed framework can be found in and a manual of our pipeline can be found in the section famann manual in the supplementary_information a framework for annotating variants to facilitate target discovery for family based sequencing studies by using famann
