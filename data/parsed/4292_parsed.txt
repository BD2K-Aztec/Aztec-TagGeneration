small_rnas in angiosperms sequence characteristics distribution and generation high_throughput hts has opened up a new era for small_rna srna exploration using hts_data for a global survey of srnas in angiosperms elevated gc contents were detected in the monocots whereas the terminal compositions were quite uniform among the angiosperms chromosome wide distribution_patterns of srnas were investigated by using scrolling window analysis we performed de_novo natural antisense transcript nat prediction and found that the overlapping regions of trans nats but not cis nats were hotspots for srna generation one cis nat generates phased natural antisense short_interfering nat sirnas specifically from flowers in arabidopsis while one in rice produces phased nat sirnas from grains suggesting their organ specific regulatory_roles in eukaryotes small_rnas srnas are essential regulators in gene_expression heterochromatin formation and virus resistance the plant srnas are divided_into two classes micrornas mirnas and sirnas the nt mirnas exert post_transcriptional on targets mostly through cleavage however the nt sirnas are more diverse two subspecies natural antisense short_interfering natsirnas and trans_acting sirnas have been characterized besides cleavage effect on targets numerous sirnas were reported to mediate dna or histone_methylation the development of sensitive high_throughput hts technology has enabled our efficient srnas exploration and there are a number of huge hts datasets available a few analytical frameworks have been proposed for analyzing such data but it is clear that these datasets contain a wealth of information that has not been fully explored here we report a large_scale analysis of hts_data for plant srnas we have surveyed the gc contents terminal compositions and chromosome wide distribution_patterns of srnas de_novo natural antisense transcript nat prediction unveiled that the overlapping regions of trans nats were hotspots for srna generation we have identified novel cis nats that produce phase distributed nat sirnas which are likely involved in organ specific regulation
