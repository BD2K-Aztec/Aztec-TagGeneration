studying the co evolution of protein_families with the mirrortree web_server the mirrortree server allows to graphically and interactively study the co evolution of two protein_families and investigate their possible interactions and functional_relationships in a taxonomic context the server includes the possibility of starting from single sequences and hence it can be used by non expert users availability_and the web_server is freely_available csbg cnb csic es mtserver it was tested in the main web_browsers adobe flash player is required at the client side to perform the interactive assessment of co evolution a lot of biological_knowledge is hidden in the complex_networks of relationships of different nature between molecular_entities in the case of proteins their biological_roles can only be fully understood in the context of their interaction with others this importance in deciphering as much as possible of the complex network of interactions and functional_relationships between proteins has led to the development of specific experimental and computational_techniques for this task one family of these computational_techniques is based on the observed relationship between protein interactions and co evolution this approach termed mirrortree has been applied not only to look for interaction_partners in large_datasets of proteins e g but also to study in depth the co evolution and interactions in particular pairs of protein_families e g many authors developed variations and different implementations of this approach e g see references in pazos and but none of them are intended to be operated by non experts users they are either very specific for certain needs or are distributed as non interactive command_line programs or require a complex preparation of the input_data e g generation of the multiple_sequence msas and or phylogenetic_trees to whom correspondence should be addressed this precludes these techniques from being used by most molecular_biologists in this work we present the mirrortree server an automatic system for the interactive assessment of co evolutionary features between two protein_families the system only requires as input the sequence of a single representative of each family to start which allows it to be used by non bioinformaticians all the subsequent steps search for homologues localization of orthologues generation and filtering of msas and trees and tree comparison are fully_automatic nevertheless expert users have the possibility of providing their manually_curated msas or trees moreover the tree comparison is done in an interactive interface that allows users to study in depth the co evolution of their families and investigate their interactions in a taxonomic context the mirrortree server is the first system for interactively assessing the co evolution between two protein_families in order to evaluate their possible interactions in a taxonomic framework there are related systems such as tsema which based on the same relationship between protein interactions and tree similarity are nevertheless intended for predicting the mapping connections between the leaves between two families already known to interact moreover that server does not include the possibility of automatically generating msas and hence it is more difficult to be used by non experts an important requirement for a computational_tool to be used by biologists is simplicity that left most existing_tools for studying co evolution and predicting protein interactions out of their standard toolkit the mirrortree server was developed with the goal of being amenable to be used by non experts in such a way that any user can interactively study the co evolution between his her families of interest in a taxonomic context starting with single sequences
