bioimage_informatics app automatic tracing of d neuron morphology based on hierarchical pruning of a gray weighted image distance tree motivation tracing of neuron morphology is an essential technique in computational neuroscience however despite a number of existing_methods few open_source techniques are completely or sufficiently automated and at the same time are able to generate robust results for real d microscopy_images results we developed all path pruning app for d neuron tracing the most important idea is to prune an initial reconstruction tree of a neurons morphology using a long_segment first hierarchical procedure instead of the original termini first search_process in app to further enhance the robustness of app we compute the distance transform of all image voxels directly for a gray_scale image without the need to binarize the image before invoking the conventional distance transform we also design a fast marching algorithm based method to compute the initial reconstruction trees without pre computing a large graph this method allows us to trace large images we bench tested app on d microscopic images and found that app can generate more satisfactory_results in most cases than several previous methods availability the software has been implemented as an open_source vaa d plugin the source_code is available in the vaa d code repository http vaa d org d reconstruction of complex neuron morphology from lightmicroscopic images is an important technique for computational neuroscience it has_received in recent_years such as in the diadem competition that involved teams worldwide and many related studies e g however despite a number of developed algorithms of neuron reconstruction also called neuron tracing it remains_a how to trace neurons in a robust and precise way from real d microscopic images automation of neuron tracing for complex neuron morphology and low quality image data has been previously discussed in the all path pruning app method the key idea of app is to generate an initial reconstruction that covers all the potential signal of a neuron in a d image followed by a linear time pruning of unneeded branches until a least compact_representation is produced while the coverage of all neuronal signal is maintained in this study we present a new version of the app algorithm called app with the goal to generate a more accurate and robust reconstruction within a shorter amount of time to attain this goal we develop new algorithms in three components i a method to generate distance transform of the neuron signal from gray_scale image directly without thresholding based binarization ii a method to generate the initial reconstruction iii a hierarchical pruning method to produce the final reconstruction compared with app all three components of app are novel especially the pruning process for where app is much more efficient than app the distance transform step and the initial reconstruction step of app are useful enhancement and can also be used for app essentially therefore to evaluate the efficiency of our algorithms we compared the tracing results with the gray weighted distance transform gwdt or without gwdt we also compared the result of app and app methods to examine the robustness of our algorithm we used signal deletion tests we also tested our algorithms on many datasets from different sources including a diadem dataset and many other more challenging datasets of fruit_fly and dragonfly neurons that have heavy noise in our experiments we have found that in most cases app is able to produce a reasonable tracing result within a short amount of time usually within seconds for a large d image our new results are often better than those generated using several other existing competitive methods to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as
