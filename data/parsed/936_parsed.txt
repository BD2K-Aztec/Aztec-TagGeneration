systems_biology characterizing cancer_subtypes as attractors of hopfield networks motivation cancer is a heterogeneous progressive_disease caused by perturbations of the underlying gene_regulatory that can be described by dynamic_models these dynamics are commonly mod eled as boolean_networks or as ordinary_differential their inference from data is computationally_challenging and at least partial knowledge of the regulatory_network and its kinetic_parameters is usually required to construct predictive_models results here we construct hopfield networks from static gene_expression data and demonstrate that cancer_subtypes can be characterized by different attractors of the hopfield network we evaluate the clustering performance of the network and find that it is comparable with traditional_methods but offers additional advantages including a dynamic_model of the energy_landscape and a unification of clustering feature_selection and network_inference we visualize the hopfield attractor landscape and propose a pruning method to generate sparse networks for feature_selection and improved understanding of feature relationships availability software and datasets are available at http acb qfab org acb hclust cellular function and development are controlled by networks that regulate the expression of genes the importance of precise regulation of gene_expression through development and cellular_differentiation is well known and perturbations of gene_regulation are associated with many complex diseases_including del at any point in time the current state of a cell can be described by its expression_profile transcripts and their concentrations and the set of all possible states defines the state_space of the cell most states are unstable and the system will converge to a stable_state of low energyan attractor statewhen perturbed waddingtons epigenetic landscape of cell development and kauffmans attractor networks b are examples of state_space models of gene_regulatory in which attractors represent stable low_energy states that emerge from the dynamics of the underlying_network in such models attractor states correspond to normal developmental_stages of the cell or disease_states such as cancer trajectories in state_space describe developmental_processes or cancer_progression and the energy elevation of the landscape is related to the transition_rates or transition_probabilities between states the existence of attractor states and of state_space trajectories of cell_differentiation has been experimentally_verified and different methods have been used to model such attractor systems with boolean_networks bns and ordinary_differential odes being the most common ones current methods are unable to describe the full complexity of a complete gene_regulatory and applications are therefore focused on specific aspects of subsystems for instance recent cancer related applications of bns include cancer networks described by logic circuit stuck at fault models models of signaling and dna_repair models of cell_adhesion for tumorigenic cells and cancer networks modeling the g s transition odes have been used to model cancer cell_populations immune_response and therapy d provide a comprehensive_overview bn and ode based models are typically small a few genes manually crafted and require intricate explicit knowledge of the regulatory subsystem and its molecular kinetics there have been attempts to construct such networks from data but this is difficult due to the complexity of the networks and the lack of suitable time series data here we propose hopfield networks as a novel approach to efficiently construct large attractor networks from static gene_expression data neither pathway data nor kinetic_information is required it has been argued that cancer is an intrinsic attractor state of the molecular cellular network and here we demonstrate that attractors of hopfield networks can correspond to cancer_subtypes specifically we construct hopfield networks for numerous cancer datasets cluster the samples according to their attractor association and measure to whom correspondence should be addressed how accurately the clusters reflect the true subtypes of the dataset in addition we use hopfield networks to perform feature_selection network pruning and network_inference and present a novel method to visualize the attractor landscape of the network it is important to appreciate that two levels of description are in play the real physical network of transcription_factors and other biomolecules that by regulating gene_expression generates and maintains the cell state and the hopfield network the structure of which we infer from observed data here sets of geneexpression patterns indicative of this cell state each level uses concepts of states trajectories and attractors here we explore mappings between these concepts e g between cancer_subtypes as attractors in a waddington landscape and attractor states in a hopfield model
