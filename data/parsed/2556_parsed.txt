sequence_analysis inuc pseknc a sequence_based predictor for predicting nucleosome_positioning in genomes with pseudo k tuple nucleotide_composition motivation nucleosome_positioning participates in many cellular_activities and plays significant roles in regulating cellular_processes with the avalanche of genome_sequences generated in the post genomic age it is highly desired to develop automated methods for rapidly and effectively identifying nucleosome_positioning although some computational_methods were proposed most of them were species specific and neglected the intrinsic local structural_properties that might play_important in determining the nucleosome_positioning on a dna_sequence results here a predictor called inuc pseknc was developed for predicting nucleosome_positioning in homo_sapiens caenorhabditis_elegans and drosophila_melanogaster genomes respectively in the new predictor the samples of dna_sequences were formulated by a novel feature_vector called pseudo k tuple nucleotide_composition into which six dna local structural_properties were incorporated it was observed by the rigorous cross_validation tests on the three stringent benchmark_datasets that the overall success_rates achieved by inuc pseknc in predicting the nucleosome_positioning of the afore mentioned three genomes were and respectively meanwhile the results obtained by inuc pseknc on various benchmark_datasets used by the previous investigators for different genomes also indicated that the current predictor remarkably outperformed its counterparts availability a user_friendly web_server inuc pseknc is freely_accessible at http the basic_unit of eukaryotic chromatin is nucleosome each nucleosome contains a bp core dna that is tightly wrapped in left_handed super helical turns around a histone_octamer as shown in the histone_octamer is formed by eight histones of which two are of h a two of h b two of h and two of h and these histones bear highly conservative property in organism evolution under the effect of histone h the nucleosome_core particle forms a stable structure by further packaging into an advanced structure adjacent nucleosomes are linked via a short dna_sequence called the linker dna which ranges from to bp by modulating the accessibility of genomic_regions to regulatory_proteins it was observed that the packaging of dna around the histone_octamer played_important in many biological_processes such as transcriptional_control dna_replication dna_repair and rna_splicing therefore it is fundamentally_important for indepth understanding the subsequent steps of gene_expression toreveal the mechanism involved in controlling nucleosome_positioning high_throughput techniques such as chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip coupled with microarrays chip_chip and chip coupled with sequencing_techniques chip_seq have been developed also high_resolution nucleosome_positioning maps are now available for several model_organisms including homo_sapiens caenorhabditis_elegans drosophila_melanogaster b and sacchoromryces cerevisiae these high_resolution data provided unprecedented_opportunities or made it feasible to develop computational_methods for accurately predicting nucleosome_positioning by feature_extraction approaches for the first time found that a bp interval repetition of aa tt ta occurred in the bp core_region of nucleosomes demonstrated that ca dinucleotide played_an in nucleosome_positioning and the sequences containing the fragment tataaacgcc had high_binding to histone found that of nucleosome placements were prefigured by genome_sequence it was also observed that nucleosome deficiency always appeared in poly da dt fragments subsequently liu et_al found that the bp periodicity signals for some particular dinucleotides such as aa tt ta and gc were more pronounced in the dna nucleosomal sequences than in the linker dna_sequences the above findings have demonstrated that nucleosome_positioning is sequence_dependent to some extent based on the characteristics of nucleosome_positioning sequence or nucleosomal sequences various computational_methods were proposed for predicting nucleosome_positioning in different genomes all these methods could yield quite encouraging_results and each of them did play a role in stimulating the development of this area however further work is needed due to the following reasons i the datasets constructed in those methods were too small to reflect the statistical profile of nucleosomes ii no cutoff threshold was imposed to rigorously exclude the redundant samples or those with high_sequence with others in a same dataset iii no web_server was provided to most of these methods and hence their usage is quite limited especially for the majority of experimental scientists iv all the local dna structural_properties and their impacts to the global sequence effects were ignored however it was demonstrated that this kind of properties might play_important in determining the rotational positioning of dna around the histone_octamer the present article was initiated in an attempt to improve the prediction of nucleosomes from the above four aspects according to a comprehensive_review and demonstrated by a series of recent_publications to establish a really useful statistical predictor for a biological system we need to consider the following procedures i construct or select a valid benchmark_dataset to train and test the predictor ii formulate the biological_samples with an effective mathematical expression that can truly reflect their intrinsic correlation with the target to be predicted iii introduce or develop a powerful algorithm or engine to operate the prediction iv properly perform cross_validation tests to objectively evaluate the anticipated accuracy of the predictor v establish a user_friendly web_server for the predictor that is accessible to the public below let us describe how to deal with these procedures one by one
