ima an r package for high_throughput analysis of illumina's k infinium methylation data the illumina_infinium is a newly_designed high_density microarray for quantifying the methylation_level of over cpg_sites within human_genome illumina methylation analyzer ima is a computational package designed to automate the pipeline for exploratory_analysis and summarization of site level and region level methylation changes in epigenetic_studies utilizing the k dna_methylation microarray the pipeline loads the data from illumina_platform and provides user customized functions commonly required to perform exploratory methylation analysis for individual sites as well as annotated regions as a major epigenetic_modification dna_methylation plays a vital role in transcriptional_regulation and chromatin_remodeling the aberration of dna_methylation profile has been found to be associated with many human_diseases use of dna_methylation microarray is a popular_approach in studies to characterize the epigenetic landscape of human cells two widely used commercial platforms to perform methylation profiling are the goldengate methylation beadarray and infinium_humanmethylation provided by illumina inc these two arrays quantitatively target cpg loci covering genes and cpg_sites targeting genes respectively since their release many analytic_methods have been developed to process and analyze the illumina dna_methylation array data for a recent summary see compared with previously released illumina dna_methylation platforms the recently launched infinium_humanmethylation represents a significant increase in the cpg_site density for quantifying methylation events at the gene level the k microarray covers of refseq genes with multiple sites in the annotated promoter bp or bp_upstream of transcription to whom correspondence should be addressed start site utr first exon gene body and utr from the cpg context it covers of cpg islands with multiple sites in the annotated cpg islands shores regions flanking island and shelves regions flanking shores while the role of dna_methylation in promoter and or cpg_island regions is long been appreciated the importance of dna_methylation in gene body or shore regions for transcription_regulation and tumor initialization has recently come to attention the significantly_increased coverage makes k microarray a powerful platform for exploring methylation profile in these annotated regions as each targeted region contains at least one cpg_site treating the region as a unit in the differential_methylation analysis might help identify regions with consistently coordinate methylation changes from a statistical point_of regionbased differential_methylation analysis will reduce the burden of multiple_comparisons and increase the power to catch differentially_methylated associated with the phenotypes of interest to this end we have developed a pipeline ima for automatic site level and region level methylation analysis using the k microarray while the pipeline is primarily designed as an automatic tool for exploratory_analysis and summarization it is flexible for users to tailor within r statistical computing and graphics environment for their specific needs the major differences between ima and existing r packages for infinium methylation analysis e g are that ima provides a pipeline which automates the tasks commonly required for the exploratory_analysis and summarization of k dna_methylation data at both site level and region level the package makes use of illumina methylation annotation for region definition as well as several bioconductor_packages for various preprocessing and differential testing steps instead of providing recommendations about which specific analysis method should be used the main purpose of developing the ima package is to provide a range of commonly used dna_methylation microarray_analysis options for users to choose for their exploratory_analysis and summarization in an automatic way written in open_source r environment it provides the flexibility for users to adopt extend and customize the functionality for their specific needs it can be used as an automatic pipeline of methylation_level index and differential analysis for downstream functional exploration and hypothesis_generation for example the matrix of methylation_index for shore regions produced by ima can be used as the input for model_based to identify clustered shores associated with the phenotype of interest analytic_methods for dna_methylation microarray_analysis are still under rapid developments future development of ima package will include the extension of its functionality by incorporating the latest preprocessing and differential analysis methods for example options will be added to filter out defective bead types e g mismatched or non uniquely aligned probes detected from systematic re annotation efforts
