systems_biology incorporating prior_knowledge into gene network study motivation a major_goal in genomic_research is to identify genes that may jointly influence a biological response from many years of intensive biomedical_research a large body of biological_knowledge or pathway_information has accumulated in available databases there is a strong interest in leveraging these pathways to improve the statistical_power and interpretability in studying gene_networks associated with complex phenotypes this prior information is a valuable complement to large_scale genomic_data such as gene_expression data generated from microarrays however it is a non trivial task to effectively integrate available biological_knowledge into gene_expression data when reconstructing gene_networks results in this article we developed and applied a lasso method from a bayesian perspective a method we call prior lasso plasso for the reconstruction of gene_networks in this method we partition edges between genes into two subsets one subset of edges is present in known pathways whereas the other has no prior information associated our method assigns different prior distributions to each subset according to a modified bayesian_information that incorporates prior_knowledge on both the network_structure and the pathway_information simulation_studies have indicated that the method is more effective in recovering the underlying_network than a traditional lasso method that does not use the prior information we applied plasso to microarray gene_expression where we used information from the pathway_commons pc and the kyoto_encyclopedia kegg as prior information for the network_reconstruction and successfully identified network hub_genes associated with clinical_outcome in cancer patients availability the source_code is available at http nba uth tmc edu homepage liu plasso a central research_focus in genomics is to identify genes and gene_networks involved in variety of biological_processes gaussian graphical_models are popular tools for the estimation of gene association networks from microarray_data these models assume that the available data are generated from a multivariate_gaussian as a consequence the main task for inferring networks is to derive conditional independencies in the joint probability_distribution of expression data for multiple genes in the framework of undirected gaussian graphical_models conditional_independence relationships can be inferred from partial correlations which are the correlations between pairs of variables given the remaining observed ones contrary to the marginal correlation the partial_correlation measures the direct association between two genes in the gene association_network once a direct gene association_network is complete the knowledge on indirect gene_associations can be easily_obtained the standard estimation of partial correlations involves either the inversion of the sample covariance_matrix or the estimation of least square regression problems unfortunately microarray_data are typically characterized by a large number of variables with a small number of samples which makes these traditional approaches inappropriate to ensure_proper estimation capability suitable alternatives based on regularized estimation of these parameters by sparsity restriction have been proposed the underlying assumption is the sparsity of biological_networks only a few edges are supposed to be present in the gene_regulatory a well known example of these regularization based techniques is the l penalized least square estimator known as the lasso technique the method has been widely adapted to high_dimensional model_selection in linear and gaussian graphical_models one limitation of these approaches is that they focus on computational or algorithmic aspects but neglect prior_biological or information many years of intensive biomedical_research has deposited a wealth of biological_knowledge into databases including genegene regulatory pathway_information one well known example of these data resources is the kyoto_encyclopedia kegg_database it is a collection of comprehensive pathway_information derived from experimental_results literature and other databases another rich resource is the pathway_commons pc that integrates biological_pathway and molecular_interaction data from publicly_available databases including biogrid hprd reactome and others these pathways are often interconnected and can be viewed as a graph of inter gene regulatory_relationships however pathway_databases represent only the static regulatory_relationships between genes or gene_products it is not clear yet to what extent a network in a particular phenotype or cell_type aligns with interactions defined in these databases a recent to whom correspondence should be addressed microarray_data analysis of genes involved with the human cell_cycle showed that as much as of the identified gene regulatory_relationships were in agreement with known regulations it is expected that integrating a priori pathway_information in a gene_expression analysis would increase the power of the method to recover biological_networks recently several methods have been developed to use pathways or network information including network constrained parameter_estimation in the framework of variable_selection tai and pan a b for example the prior information was incorporated into a spatially_correlated mixture_model for selecting targets of one transcription_factor in addition an ising_model using network knowledge was used to_identify in this study we developed a prior information dependent lasso plasso procedure for regularized estimation of largescale gene association networks specifically we embedded prior network information into the regularized_regression such that it could specify preferences for particular sets of variables in the model the rationale is derived from a bayesian perspective of lasso a mixture of two laplacian distributions was conceptually proposed to represent different prior_knowledge of two sets of gene interactions one set is present in known pathways whereas the other has no known prior information we first explored the effectiveness of the plasso using simulation_studies and then applied the plasso to a breast_cancer dataset and an ovarian_cancer dataset to evaluate the proposed method we have demonstrated the effectiveness and power of our plasso procedure through both simulation_studies
