structural_bioinformatics nasp a parallel program for identifying evolutionarily_conserved nucleic_acid secondary_structures from nucleotide sequence_alignments many natural nucleic_acid have evolutionarily_conserved secondary_structures with diverse_biological a reliable computational_tool for identifying such structures would be very useful in guiding experimental analyses of their biological_functions nasp nucleic_acid predictor is a program that takes_into thermodynamic_stability boltzmann base_pair probabilities alignment uncertainty covarying sites and evolutionary_conservation to identify biologically_relevant secondary_structures within multiple_sequence unique to nasp is the consideration of all this information together with a recursive permutation based_approach to progressively identify and list the most conserved probable secondary_structures that are likely to have the greatest biological_relevance by focusing on identifying only evolutionarily_conserved structures nasp forgoes the prediction of complete nucleotide folds but outperforms various other secondary_structure prediction_methods in its ability to selectively identify actual base_pairings availability downloable and web_based versions of nasp are freely_available at
