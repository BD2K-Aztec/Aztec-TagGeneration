qslimfinder improved short_linear motif prediction using specific query_protein data motivation the sensitivity of de_novo short_linear motif slim prediction is limited by the number of patterns the motif space being assessed for enrichment qslimfinder uses specific query_protein information to restrict the motif space and thereby increase the sensitivity_and of predictions results qslimfinder was extensively benchmarked using known slim containing proteins and simulated protein interaction datasets of real human proteins exploiting prior_knowledge of a query_protein likely to be involved in a slim mediated interaction increased the proportion of true_positives correctly returned and reduced the proportion of datasets returning a false_positive prediction the biggest improvement was seen if a short region of the query_protein flanking the interaction_site was known all biological_processes are underpinned by proteinprotein_interactions ppi to understand the interactome we must know how ppi are regulated in time and space to produce biological_functions an emerging field of biology is the study of the role in ppi_networks of intrinsically_disordered protein regions which lack a stable unbound three_dimensional structure of particular interest short_linear slims mediate an important subset of the cells disordered ppi via domain motif interactions slims are typically amino_acids in length with fewer than six and as few as two functionally specific_residues slims are involved in an incredibly diverse range of biological_processes including cell_cycle cell_signalling post_translational subcellular_localization gene_expression membrane binding protein_folding cell_adhesion and cell_death with over annotated classes slims usually bind with low_affinity making them ideal for quick or transient responses and are likely to be particularly enriched in signalling_pathways the small protein_sequence signature of slims combined with their low_affinity ppi makes experimental discovery difficult considerable attention has therefore been given to computational_methods for slim prediction these same features confer evolutionary plasticity on slim mediated ppi and enable high functional density which is frequently exploited by pathogens to hijack host cellular_processes convergent i e independent evolution is also prevalent within species consequently identifying over represented motifs by explicitly modelling convergent_evolution is among the most successful_approaches for de_novo prediction of slims from v c the author published_by
