genome_analysis prism a primer selection and matching tool for amplification and sequencing of viral_genomes prism is a set of algorithms designed to select and match degenerate primer_pairs for the amplification of viral_genomes the design of panels of hundreds of primer_pairs takes just hours using this program compared with days using a manual approach prism allows for rapid in silico optimization of primers for downstream applications such as sequencing as a validation prism was used to create an amplification primer panel for human_immunodeficiency hiv clade b availability the program is freely_available for use at www broadinstitute org perl seq specialprojects viral_populations are dynamic and the strains circulating in an infected population often vary geographically and temporally rna_viruses especially those that cause chronic_disease such as hepatitis_c hcv and human_immunodeficiency hiv exhibit tremendous sequence_diversity as such primers designed from a single reference_genome may limit the number of variants captured from within a single patient as well as variants isolated from different geographic_regions and time periods here we report on a novel primer_design method that i leverages existing genome_sequence to design degenerate_primers that account for the significant diversity observed in viral_populations and ii maximizes the ability to successfully amplify and sequence the genomes of viruses from different individuals that may differ significantly from a single viral reference_genome previous primer selection algorithms have been designed to amplify single target_regions or optimized for snp or gene specific pcr groupspecific pcr or for phylogenetically_related dna_sequences these methods do not however permit push button full genome length primer_pair design from very diverse organisms such as those represented by rna_viruses to whom correspondence should be addressed a comparison of the features of prism to those of several other primer_design programs is included in supplementary table prism takes_advantage of existing sequence_information for a given viral strain to select the optimal primers based on user defined_criteria the algorithm then suggests pairs of primers to make up a panel that will generate amplicons of desired length and overlap diversity capture is increased through the use of degenerate base codes page we have used prism to design successful primers suitable for the full genome_sequencing of dengue_virus denv west_nile wnv hiv hcv and lassa_virus data not shown all of these viruses exist natively as single_stranded genomes with genome lengths in the kb range here we report on performance results from hiv clade b as this demonstrates the stability of prism even when viral strain diversity is high we downloaded full genome_sequences for hiv clade b from the los alamos hiv database www hiv lanl gov and a multiple_alignment was created using the muscle algorithm with standard settings using default_settings of prism forward primers and reverse primers were deemed to be valid from these amplicons between and bp were identified to meet our coverage target and fit on our plate based pcr format a total of of these were chosen to amplify the hiv_genome see_supplementary for a list of the primer_pairs the computational part of the process took h min between job submission and receipt of an email with the final results in order to test the robustness of the prism designed primers hiv_rna was extracted from chronically_infected patients and converted to cdna as previously described a single large amplicon spanning nucleotides of the hiv_genome was generated from each cdna and nested pcr_reactions were set up using the prism designed panel eight out of ten samples had amplification success_rates as calculated by number of successful products out of possible of with another sample yielding positive bands only one sample had three or more overlapping products fail see_supplementary for more details these results compare very favorably with our observed hiv pcr performance historically data not shown
