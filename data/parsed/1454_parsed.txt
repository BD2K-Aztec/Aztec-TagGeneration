dnashaper an r bioconductor_package for dna shape prediction and feature encoding dnashaper predicts dna shape_features in an ultra_fast high_throughput manner from genomic sequencing_data the package takes either nucleotide_sequence or genomic_coordinates as input and generates various graphical_representations for visualization and further analysis dnashaper further encodes dna_sequence and shape_features as user_defined combinations of k_mer and dna shape_features the resulting feature matrices can be readily used as input of various machine_learning software_packages for further modeling studies availability_and the dnashaper software_package was implemented in the statistical programming_language r and is freely_available through the bioconductor_project at https www bioconductor org_packages devel bioc html dnashaper html and at the github developer site http tsupeichiu github io dnashaper
