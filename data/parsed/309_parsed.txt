gene_expression an efficient algorithm for accurate computation of the dirichlet multinomial log likelihood_function the dirichlet multinomial dmn distribution is a fundamental model for multicategory count_data with overdispersion this distribution has many uses in bioinformatics including applications to metagenomics_data transctriptomics and alternative_splicing the dmn distribution reduces to the multinomial distribution when the overdispersion parameter is unfortunately numerical computation of the dmn log likelihood_function by conventional methods results in instability in the neighborhood of an alternative formulation circumvents this instability but it leads to long runtimes that make it impractical for large count_data common in bioinformatics we have developed a new method for computation of the dmn log_likelihood to solve the instability problem without incurring long runtimes the new approach is composed of a novel formula and an algorithm to extend its applicability our numerical_experiments show that this new method both improves the accuracy of log_likelihood evaluation and the run time by several orders_of especially in high count_data situations that are common in deep sequencing_data using real meta genomic_data our method achieves manyfold runtime improvement our method increases the feasibility of using the dmn distribution to model many high_throughput problems in bioinformatics we have included in our work an r package giving access to this method and a vingette applying this approach to metagenomic_data availability_and an implementation of the algorithm together with a vignette describing its use is available in supplementarythe analysis of count_data or categorical_data is an important topic in statistics and has a wide_variety of applications in bioinformatics the advent_of sequencing_technologies provides unprecedented_opportunities for investigating new and more powerful analysis methods on count_data the poisson_distribution is a basic distribution for modeling count_data an important property of the poisson_distribution is that the mean and variance are the same which is called equidispersion however the mean and the variance of real count_data are often not the same in fact the variance is often greater than the mean this makes the poisson_distribution not ideal for analyzing such data because the equidispersion assumption is violated the phenomenon where a dataset exhibits greater variance than what would be expected in a statistical_model is called overdispersion a commonly used overdispersed model for the poisson_distribution is the negative_binomial this distribution has been extensively_studied in hilbe and is an indispensable model for high_throughput sequencing_data another fundamental model in count_data analysis is the multinomial mn distribution which is useful for analysis of count proportions among multiple categories one important use case of the mn distribution is fishers_exact of contingency_tables which has been used in the analysis of alternative utr utilization and splicing as well as metagenomics in the regression context mn logistic_regression is also commonly used however real_data often exhibit heterogeneity that is usually thought to be caused by dependencies or the similarity of responses of members of the same cluster in cluster sampling this leads to extra multinomial variation i e overdispersion with respect to the mn distribution the modeling of overdispersion of the mn distribution has been addressed by extending the mn distribution to the dirichlet multinomial dmn distribution the beta_binomial bb distributiona special_case of the dmn distribution with only two categorieshas been studied by many because of its flexibility and its mathematical convenience the dmn distribution is widely_applied to diverse fields such as topic modeling magazine exposure modeling word burstiness modeling language modeling and multiple_sequence bouguila also considered a generalization of the dmn distribution and applied it to count_data to whom correspondence should be addressed clustering another related distribution for handling overdispersion is the dirichlet negative mn distribution allowing the modeling of correlated count_data without an upper_bound which has many possible uses in biostatistics and bioinformatics likelihood functions play_a in statistical_inference for example likelihood functions can be used for parameter_estimation hypothesis_testing and interval estimation in the context of the dmn distribution there has been recent research to investigate the fisher_information and maximum_likelihood mle not all statistical_inference methods are based on likelihood functions for instance kim and margolin developed a method for testing the goodness_of of the mn distribution against the dmn distribution based on the c test_statistic a flexible framework built on the likelihood approach that enables the analysis of complex experimental_designs that frequently appear in genomic and bioinformatics studies in this article we study the fundamental problem of the evaluation of the dmn log likelihood_function in section we demonstrate the instability and runtime problems of two existing_methods for computing the dmn log likelihood_function and propose a novel parameterization of the log likelihood_function to allow smooth transition from the overdispersed case the dmn distribution to the non overdispersed case the mn distribution for this new parameterized form in section we introduce a new formula based on a truncated series consisting of bernoulli polynomials in section a mesh algorithm is devised to increase the applicability of this new formula in section we show numerical_results of the mesh algorithm confirm its stability and runtime improvements finally we applied our method to human_microbiome data and demonstrated its large performance improvement over the most accurate existing method overdispersion is important and needs to be accommodated in modeling count_data to handle overdispersion in mn data the dmn distribution is commonly used the numerical computation of the log likelihood_function is important for performing statistical_inference using this distribution previous work has provided useful methods for this calculation but the requirements of bioinformatics are difficult to satisfy our method solves the accuracy and runtime challenges the mesh algorithm is much faster than the algorithm in vgam for the dmn log_likelihood computation the parameters are x n p and the computation using vgam is only up to n as it takes too much runtime when n is beyond this point each boxplot represents dmn log_likelihood evaluationsoverdispersion is commonly found in high_throughput sequencing_data the overdispersed poisson_model the negative_binomial has been used to detect differential_gene however the dmn distribution has seen limited use in analyzing high_throughput sequencing_data possibly because the existing_methods based on the dmn distribution did not anticipate the high counts and the vast amount of such count tables extracted from the high_throughput to overcome the instability problem and the runtime problem of the existing_methods for computing the log_likelihood we derived a new approximation of the dmn log likelihood_function based on bernoulli polynomials using a novel mesh algorithm we are able to compute the log_likelihood for any parameters in the domains of the log likelihood_function comparing with the existing_methods the mesh algorithm is more accurate and is much faster we demonstrate the application of the new method in analyzing human_microbiome data with a large runtime improvement this method is generally_applicable to other scenarios involving proportions such as alternative exon utilization and alternative poly a utilization for example suppose we have alternative_splicing that need to be tested and each test requires log likelihood_function evaluations our method can reduce the runtime to hours instead of potentially days this work paves the way for application of the dmn distribution to model overdispersion in large_scale count_data available in the high_throughput era
