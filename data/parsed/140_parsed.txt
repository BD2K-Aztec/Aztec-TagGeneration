sequence_analysis a dynamic wavelet_based algorithm for pre_processing tandem_mass data motivation mass_spectrometry ms based proteomics is one of the most commonly used research techniques for identifying and characterizing proteins in biological and medical_research the identification of a protein is the critical first step in elucidating its biological_function successful protein identification depends on various interrelated factors including effective analysis of ms data generated in a proteomic experiment this analysis comprises several stages often combined in a pipeline or workflow the first component of the analysis is known as spectra pre_processing in this component the raw_data generated by the mass_spectrometer is processed to eliminate noise and identify the mass to charge ratio m z and intensity for the peaks in the spectrum corresponding to the presence of certain peptides or peptide_fragments since all downstream_analyses depend on the pre processed data effective pre_processing is critical to protein identification and characterization there is a critical need for more robust pre_processing algorithms that perform well on tandem_mass under a variety of different conditions and can be easily integrated into sophisticated data analysis_pipelines for practical wet_lab applications result we have developed a new pre_processing algorithm based on wavelet theory our method uses a dynamic peak model to identify peaks it is designed to be easily integrated into a complete proteomic_analysis workflow we compared the method with other available algorithms using a reference library of raw ms and tandem_ms spectra with known protein composition information our pre_processing algorithm results in the identification of significantly more peptides and proteins in the downstream_analysis for a given false_discovery mass_spectrometry ms based proteomics enables studies of the complexity and dynamics of proteins in biological_systems it involves the identification and characterization of the entire set to whom correspondence should be addressed of proteins expressed by the genome as well as understanding changes in protein expression levels and how proteins interact with each other increasingly many scientific investigators are using tandem_ms ms_ms for high_throughput protein identification and quantification in recent_years there has been rapid development in ms technology the development of methods such as isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation itraq provides researchers with powerful techniques to determine the relative_expression of thousands of proteins simultaneously the precise identification of proteins is crucial in developing new diagnostic prognostic and therapeutic products for the treatment of human_diseases such as cancer asthma and diabetes furthermore accurate quantitative protein expression information enables scientists to reliably determine the proteins critical to specific_biological and provides a powerful mechanism to identify disease_biomarkers and to design more effective medicines however accurate statistical_analysis of raw tandem spectrum data remains_a current statistical and computational_analysis of ms data involves several challenges after acquiring raw spectra from a mass_spectrometer it is necessary to pass through all components of a complete data analysis workflow in order to obtain the final results the complete data analysis workflow as illustrated in can be sub divided_into several analysis components spectra pre_processing peptide and protein identification and protein quantification the first step in pre_processing involves identifying and locating peaks within raw ms and ms_ms these peaks where by peaks we refer to any peak shaped signals may correspond to the presence of peptides or peptide_fragments in the sample in this article we examined the overall proteomic_data analysis workflow and demonstrated that our newly_proposed dynamic wavelet_based pre_processing algorithm is able to significantly_outperform currently available ms_ms pre_processing algorithms by producing more accurate peptide and protein_identifications and increasing the spectra snr these are the key functionalities for a pre_processing algorithm our experiments demonstrate that mass_spectra pre_processing is an important component of the overall ms based proteomic_analysis greatly affecting the downstream results considerably more peptides and proteins can be identified with more sophisticated pre_processing algorithms with powerful spectra pre_processing methods the accuracy and reliability of ms based quantitative proteomic_analysis such as isotope coded affinity_tag icat stable_isotope with amino_acids siliac and itraq can also be greatly_improved despite this pre_processing has attracted less attention than the other aspects of tandem_ms data analysis and there is a lack of available reliable pre_processing algorithms for tandem_ms data therefore we have developed our new pre_processing algorithm to address_this spectrum signal_intensity has been the major criterion used in pre_processing peak_picking tandem_ms spectra consequently peptide and protein identification has been critically dependent on the spectrum signal_intensity the superior_performance of dywave demonstrates that such an approach has its limitations we have shown that using additional information about signal shape can lead to much more accurate identification and increase identification coverage this is especially true with low precision mass_spectrometers where excessive noise and spurious peaks are expected even with high_precision instruments it is common for many peaks corresponding to real y or b peptide fragment_ions to have relatively weak intensity thus making them difficult to identify this may be why our method is able to identify more peptides and proteins by taking account of additional signal shape characteristics assessment results also demonstrate that accurate selection of the wavelet_transform scale is crucial with more accurately selected wavelet_transform scales a dynamic wavelet model can have better performance than a static wavelet method which applies wavelet_transform on fixed scales therefore the applicability of intensitybased pre_processing becomes difficult in many real applications and methods having stronger analytical basis such as wavelet based_approaches are more reliable high_throughput tandem_ms proteomic_analysis is peptidecentric the identification and quantification of proteins are inferred from the identified peptides giving rise to the observed spectra in most cases peptide level analysis is an intermediate step because the ultimate_goal of most experiments is to identify the proteins however the ease of protein identification often depends on the number and quality of the identified peptides in comparing proteinlevel identification and peptide level identification the commercial software cannot consistently translate an improvement in peptide_identification to an improvement in protein identification although it can identify more peptides than the predominant intensity based_approach from the tpp our method shows a clear advantage from this perspective this may be due to larger number of weak peptide fragment signals being identified by our method this is hard to attain using the static wavelet method furthermore these weak peptide signals enable the protein database search_engine to successfully assign more protein_identifications thus we hypothesize that the successful identification of proteins is dependent on two distinct aspects the identification of peptides from spectra and the peptide to protein assignment one potential reason for the independence of these two aspects is ambiguities in determining the identities of proteins that share multiple peptides thus identifying more peptides is not the only benefit we can gain from a dynamic pre_processing algorithm by successfully recovering the weak peptide_fragments from the spectra we can greatly improve the peptide to protein assignment as protein identification can be an error_prone exercise the estimation of the frequency of false identification is important the target_decoy evaluation strategy has become the most widely used means of estimating the fdr in proteomic research this approach involves introducing answers that are known a priori to be incorrect called decoys to the search_space by making the assumption that incorrect identifications are uniformly_distributed in the search_space one can estimate the fdr from the number of decoy hits existing study has indicated that the target_decoy strategy is prone to underestimate the actual fdr especially at peptide level the underestimated fdr suggests the distribution of decoy identifications does not accurately represent the target null_distribution in other words there is unequal likelihood of selecting an incorrect peptide match from the target_database as compared to selecting a match from the reversed decoy_database even if the search algorithm is presented with an equal number of target and decoy peptides in our comparison studies we have demonstrated the estimated fdrs in a comparative setting are biased toward underestimating the real fdrs in the identification even though a reversed sequence database seemingly is the logical choice for a decoy false_positive target hits have been demonstrated to be more likely than decoy hits therefore we should keep in mind that the real fdr is likely to be higher than the target_decoy estimated fdr one difficulty in proteomic research is most software is proprietary and there is a lack of open alternatives this problem significantly hinders the advance of proteomic research as proprietary software often makes collaborative_research difficult many modern bioinformatics research_projects
