sequence_analysis adding unaligned sequences into an existing alignment using mafft and last two methods to add unaligned sequences into an existing multiple_sequence have been implemented as the add and addfragments options in the mafft package the former option is a basic one and applicable only to full_length sequences whereas the latter option is applicable even when the unaligned sequences are short and fragmentary these methods internally infer the phylogenetic_relationship among the sequences in the existing alignment and the phylogenetic positions of unaligned sequences benchmarks based on two independent simulations consistently suggest that the addfragments option outperforms recent methods papara and pagan in accuracy for difficult_problems and that these three methods appropriately handle easy problems
