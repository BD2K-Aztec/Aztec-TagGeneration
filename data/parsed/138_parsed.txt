a dynamic data_structure for flexible molecular maintenance and informatics motivation we present the dynamic packing grid dpg a neighborhood data_structure for maintaining and manipulating flexible molecules and assemblies for efficient computation of binding_affinities in drug_design or in molecular_dynamics results dpg can efficiently maintain the molecular_surface using only linear space and supports quasi constant time insertion deletion and movement i e updates of atoms or groups of atoms dpg also supports constant time neighborhood queries from arbitrary points our results for maintenance of molecular_surface and polarization energy computations using dpg exhibit marked improvement in time and space requirements many human functional processes are mediated through the interactions among proteins a major molecular constituent of our anatomical makeup a computational understanding of these interactions provides important_clues for developing therapeutic_interventions related to diseases such as cancer and metabolic_disorders computational_methods such as automated docking through shape and energetic complementarity scoring aim to gain insight and predict such molecular_interactions docking involves induced complementary fit between flexible protein interfaces the flexible docking solution_space consisting of all relative positions orientations and conformations of the proteins is searched and each putative docking is evaluated using combinations of interface complementarity scoring and atomic pairwise charged coulombic interactions also since proteins function in predominantly watery solvent environment the protein solvation_energy also plays an important role in determining intermolecular binding_affinities in vivo for drug_screening as well as in molecular_dynamics simulations and in the study of hydrophobicity and protein_folding when computing the solvation_energy for molecules it is crucial to correctly model and sample the molecular_surface the most common model for molecules is a collection of atoms represented by spherical balls with radii equal to their van_der to whom correspondence should be addressed waals radii the surface of the union of these spheres is known as the van_der surface accessibility to the solvent namely the solvent accessible surface sas can be defined as the locus of the center of a probe sphere as it contacts the molecular_surface usually the probe is a water_molecule modeled as a sphere with radius another definition for molecular_surface is as a set of contact and reentrant patches commonly known as the solvent contact_surface scs or solvent excluded surface ses or simply the molecular_surface while a number of techniques have been devised for the static construction of molecular_surfaces see e g for a brief review not much work has been done on neighborhood data_structures for the dynamic maintenance of molecular_surfaces under conformational changes and domain movements considered limited dynamic maintenance of molecular_surfaces based on non uniform rational bsplines nurbs descriptions for the patches eyal and halperin presented an algorithm based on dynamic graph connectivity that updates the union of balls molecular_surface after a conformational_change in o log n amortized time per affected by this change atom b in this article we present the dynamic packing grid dpg a space and time efficient neighborhood data_structure that maintains a collection of balls atoms in space allowing a range of spherical range queries and updates for rapid scoring of flexible proteinprotein_interactions the efficiency of the data_structure results from the assumption that the centers of two different balls in the collection cannot come arbitrarily close to each other which is a natural property of molecules a consequence of this assumption is that any ball in the collection can intersect at most a constant number of other balls on a ram with w bit words our dpg data_structure can report all balls intersecting a given ball or within o r max distance from a given point in o loglogw time with high_probability w h p where r max is the radius of the largest ball in the collection it can also answer whether a given ball is exposed i e lies on the union boundary or buried within the same time bound at any time the entire union boundary can be extracted from the data_structure in o m time in the worst_case where m is the number of atoms on the boundary there are existing techniques like which can compute approximate the exposed atoms and the surface_area in the same time bound but do not allow dynamic updates on the other hand dpg supports updates i e insertion_deletion movement of a ball in o logw time w h p the data_structure uses linear space as we show here dpgs can be used to maintain both the van_der surface and the scs of a molecule within the performance bounds mentioned above dpgs can also be used to enable fast energetics calculation by rapidly locating the atoms close to each sampled integration point of the scs besides protein_docking and molecular_dynamics the neighborhood query and surface maintenance of dpg also has potential applications in interactive computer_aided design cad tools developed for de_novo drug_design protein_folding n body simulations etc all these applications often need to handle extremely_large number of atoms or points
