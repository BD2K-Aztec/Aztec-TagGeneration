prediction of a gene_regulatory linked to prostate_cancer from gene_expression microrna and clinical data motivation cancer is a complex disease triggered by mutations in multiple genes and pathways there is a growing interest in the application of systems_biology approaches to analyze various types of cancer related data to understand the overwhelming complexity of changes induced by the disease during the past_century the basic strategy to decypher biological_functions was essentially to concentrate efforts on a very limited set of molecules of interest this reductive or gene centric approach has had and still has an enormous success producing immediately applicable results in all areas of molecular_biology knowledge however it has become clear that biological_function can rarely be assigned to an individual molecule but is rather the result of the interactions among a discrete set of various types of molecules proteins rna metabolites etc those functional_modules are a critical level of biological_organization that cannot be identified by the study of their individual components one of the main goals of systems_biology is to determine those modules and their components by data_mining and integrating high_throughput omics_data cancer is essentially a genetic disease characterized by an uncontrolled proliferation and survival of damaged cells resulting in tumor_formation unlike other diseases such as cystic_fibrosis to whom correspondence should be addressed or muscular_dystrophy there is no single gene defect that directly causes cancer cells have multiple safeguards to prevent the effects of mutations appearing in various cancer_genes and it is only when several of those genes are affected that an invasive and potentially_lethal tumor develops the picture is further complicated by the fact that new classes of molecules like micrornas mirnas have been shown to play_a in tumorigenesis and therefore should be taken into account esquela prostate_cancer is the third most common cancer in men worldwide and occurs principally in the united_states canada and northwestern europe but is uncommon in asian_countries and south_america prostate_cancer is a complex disease and finding the genetic causes of this disease has proven to be difficult even if genome_wide have recently detected a number of genetic_variants gene_fusions and expression signatures associated with this disease furthermore the progression of prostate_cancer is also complex with only of the patients being diagnosed with an aggressive form that can evolve to threaten their life the determinants of this outcome are largely_unknown there is an increasing interest in systems_biology approaches for the discovery of genes associated with cancer those approaches help to simplify the overwhelmingly complex_picture that is often coming out of more traditional approaches by constructing more easily_interpretable network representations of the underlying system and deriving concrete experimentally verifiable hypotheses the integration of clinical data in a robust framework that would allow the identification of modules that are pathologically altered in disease has been identified as one of the major challenges for network biology here we used the lemone algorithm to reconstruct a regulatory module network linked to prostate_cancer using a large dataset of lymphoblastoid_cells samples for which expression levels were measured for genes as well as mirnas lemone uses ensemblebased probabilistic optimization techniques to identify clusters of co expressed genes and their putative regulators the algorithm has been validated and applied on various biological_data recently we applied it to a set of cancer samples of various origins for which expression data were available for both genes and a limited set of mirnas a couple of mirnas were identified as high_scoring regulators for several modules of co expressed genes and a mirna was validated experimentally as a regulator of a module linked to epithelial homeostasis with a possible role in epithelial_to so_far we used expression data measurements topage i i i in this study we have applied a module network algorithm to a large expression data_set measured on lymphoblastoid_cell coming from patients having different forms of prostate_cancer compared to our previous applications of the algorithm we have further extended it to simultaneously evaluate a heterogeneous set of candidate regulators which can be continuous valued or discrete we predicted a module network of modules of co expressed genes with their associated high_scoring regulators most of the modules show enrichment for specific go categories several of those categories are related to cell_cycle and mitosis activities which is consistent_with on the same dataset almost of the predicted regulators are mirnas and many of them have been characterized as causal in many diseases including cancer our results also suggest novel mirna candidates that could be linked to prostate_cancer this study also associate the gleason_score a clinical parameter to modules enriched in cell_growth and mitosis our study clearly demonstrate the interest of systems_biology approaches to study cancer and its consequences more particularly by the integration of heterogeneous sets of candidate regulators this type of analysis can be applied to various cancer_types and tissues for which relevant expression data for mrna mirna and various clinical parameters are available
