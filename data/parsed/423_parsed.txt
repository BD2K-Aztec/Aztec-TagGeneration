a pipeline for rna_seq data_processing and quality_assessment we present an r based pipeline arrayexpresshts for pre_processing expression estimation and data quality_assessment of high_throughput transcriptional_profiling rna_seq the pipeline starts from raw sequence files and produces standard bioconductor r objects containing gene or transcript measurements for downstream_analysis along with web reports for data quality_assessment it may be run locally on a users own computer or remotely on a distributed r cloud farm at the european_bioinformatics it can be used to analyse users own datasets or public rna_seq from the arrayexpress archive deep_sequencing of cdna molecules rna_seq is becoming the tool of choice for gene_expression studies often replacing microarrays to estimate gene_expression levels and rapidly superseding exon arrays in alternative_splicing analysis or tilling arrays in the identification of previously_unknown transcribed regions in fact rna_seq allows researchers to study phenomena that were previously beyond the reach of microarrays such as allele_specific the popularity of the new sequencing methods for gene_expression is attested by the numerous recent_publications and by the increasing number of submissions to public data_repositories such as arrayexpress ae many methods have been developed recently to tackle different aspects of rna_seq but combining them into a robust analysis_pipeline is an inherently study specific task and poses ongoing challenges the configuration options used for each tool affect the others used downstream making it necessary for bioinformaticians to have a thorough knowledge of each one of them and its internal workings furthermore rna_seq methods routinely generate tens of millions of raw sequence_reads corresponding to hundreds of gigabytes of data the analysis of which requires intensive computational processing_steps that render the analysis to whom correspondence should be addressed impossible without the use of powerful servers the gap between experimental throughput and processing_speed is widening with the analysis component falling behind in light of these considerations we have developed arrayexpresshts an automated r bioconductor based pipeline for pre_processing expression estimation and data quality_assessment of rna_seq starting from the raw read files it produces standard r objects containing expression levels for downstream_analysis and graphical html reports for data quality_assessment the pipeline has a choice of analysis methods and guides their configuration flexibility is provided for power users to adjust all aspects of the pipeline within the well known and powerful r language the arrayexpresshts package allows the users to obtain a standard bioconductor expressionset object containing expression levels from raw sequence files with a single r function call the main benefit of arrayexpresshts is the ease of its use running in the same way either on a local computer or on the r cloud and with private or public data written in r and available as open_source it also gives users the opportunity to extend and customize the pipeline for their needs it can be used for individual data analyses or in routine data production pipelines and it will be extended in the future to support other sequencing_platforms multiplexed data and the reporting of expression of non annotated regions
