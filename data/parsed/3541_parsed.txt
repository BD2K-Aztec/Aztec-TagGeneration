phylat a phylogenetic local alignment_tool motivation the expansion of dna_sequencing capacity has enabled the sequencing of whole genomes from a number of related species these genomes can be combined in a multiple_alignment that provides useful information about the evolutionary_history at each genomic locus one area in which evolutionary_information can productively be exploited is in aligning a new sequence to a database of existing aligned genomes however existing high_throughput alignment tools are not designed to work effectively with multiple_genome results we introduce phylat the phylogenetic local alignment_tool to compute local_alignments of a query_sequence against a fixed multiple genome alignment of closely_related phylat uses a known phylogenetic_tree on the species in the multiple_alignment to improve the quality of its computed alignments while also estimating the placement of the query on this tree it combines a probabilistic_approach to alignment with seeding and expansion heuristics to accelerate discovery of significant alignments we provide evidence using alignments of human_chromosome against a five species alignment from the ucsc_genome database that phylats alignments are more accurate than those of other commonly used programs including blast poy mafft muscle and clustal phylat also identifies more alignments in coding_dna than does pairwise_alignment alone finally our tool determines the evolutionary_relationship of query_sequences to the database more accurately than do poy raxml epa or pplacer the proliferation of high_throughput has produced a huge amount of genomic dna_sequence including genomes from many higher_eukaryotes intensively_studied clades of organisms such as mammals drosophila fruit_flies and worms of the genus are now typically represented in public_databases by complete or partial genomes of multiple species a group of closely_related genomes can be combined into a large_scale multiple_alignment of orthologous sequences to whom correspondence should be addressed building a high_quality multiple genome alignment requires a large investment of computational_resources and curation time particularly if the alignment will become a reference for future users we would therefore like to amortize this investment by effectively utilizing information present in the alignment that is not readily available from its component genomes multiple_genome are commonly used to interrogate a clades evolutionary_history often with the help of a phylogenetic_tree on the component species or to discover genomic_loci of unusually high_conservation or unusually fast change however they are rarely used to augment one of the most common operations in bioinformatics aligning a new sequence to an existing reference in principle using a reference multiple_alignment rather than any one of its component genomes to align a query_sequence should result in a more accurate alignment since the aligner can use the pattern of conservation at each position to more accurately determine which query base corresponds to which multiple_alignment column moreover given a phylogenetic_tree relating the species in the reference an aligner should be able to use standard probabilistic_models of evolution to compare the likelihoods of possible alignments rather than resorting to an arbitrary scoring system in fact alignment could even infer the evolutionary_relationship of the query to the reference placing it on the tree of the references species in practice however most widely used alignment tools either cannot use reference multiple_alignments or cannot do so in a phylogenetically aware way blast and other accelerated variants of smithwaterman are widely used for pairwise sequence comparison but these methods compare only individual sequences psi_blast creates an alignment between a query and a profile computed from a database of individual reference_sequences however the construction of the profile does not take into account phylogenetic_information so it does not weigh each reference_sequence in a phylogeny aware way hmmer and sam can align a sequence to a pre_existing multiple_alignment if it is generalized to a profile hidden_markov but even these tools use only statistical conservation at each position rather than phylogenetic_information to perform alignments tools for de_novo multiple_sequence exist that use trees to improve alignment_quality the classic clustal software uses a guide_tree to align multiple_sequences more recent tools such as poy can align sequences given a tree or jointly compute a multiple_alignment and a supporting phylogeny however these tools cannot as a rule incrementally update a multiple_alignment and tree starting fromphylat is built around an em like algorithm that simultaneously computes an alignment between a query_sequence and a multiple_alignment and predicts the placement of the query on the tree associated with the multiple_alignment the algorithm iteratively refines query alignment and branch placement until both have converged to accelerate this core alignment algorithm we adopt a blast like seed generation and extension heuristic see supplementary_materials we use the evolutionary consensus_sequence of the multiple_alignment to rapidly generate pairwise seed alignments filter these seeds by e value and finally apply the core algorithm to each seed the structure of the aligner is illustrated in while phylat generally aligned query_sequences to their orthologous regions as inferred from the ucsc database there were human query_sequences which were not aligned to their orthologous regions we examined these query_sequences using blast and found that all of them are highly_conserved coding_regions which are likely difficult to distinguish from the orthologous loci on the basis of similarity alone these sequences are spread over genes the most frequently hit gene was igl hit by queries which is an immunoglobulin lambda locus we also examined human queries whose branch placements in phylat were not on the branch leading to rhesus yet had entropies indicating high_confidence in the wrong placement these queries hit cds regions from genes listed in we searched for these genes and their families in treefam and found that for of the placements the gene_trees were different from the species_tree we hypothesized that phylats wrong branch placement prediction in these cases was an artifact of the incorrect tree provided for the informant species to test this hypothesis we reran phylat on the identified cases using the appropriate gene_tree from treefam as the reference tree in each case we found that in out of the cases phylats query placements with the revised input tree were consistent with the gene_tree from treefam we further note that the distribution of the wrong placements is in accordance with the theory of deep coalescence which states that short wide trees may show more genes with deep coalescence than long narrow trees seefor an example we have described phylat an efficient phylogenetically aware tool computing and scoring local_alignments between a query_sequence and a large multiple_alignment in our tests phylats accuracy in alignments involving coding_dna exceeded that of blast even using the consensus of all species in the database phylats accuracy also exceeded that of phylogeny aware alignment tools moreover the inferred placement of queries on the tree of the database species was typically both topologically accurate and confident we believe that phylats methods will prove useful in augmenting existing high_throughput sequence comparison tools to exploit the extra_information provided by multiple genome alignment databases several opportunities exist to improve phylats performance and utility first our assumption that successive residues in the query or successive columns in the multiple_alignment are stochasticallyindependent is not realistic it could be useful to add a dependence model between adjacent bases columns to improve the accuracy of alignment second phylat assumes that its query is a single dna_sequence it would be useful to handle queries that are themselves multiple_alignments however there are unresolved computational_complexity issues with this extension in particular we cannot simply enumerate all simultaneous branch placements of all species in the query multiple_alignment with respect to the database multiple_alignment some efficient way must be found to form a hypothesis about how the query species and database species relate within a single tree third we need to develop efficient approaches to estimate the statistical_significance of gapped alignments in phylat without resorting to expensive simulations karlin and altschuls theory for ungapped alignments is not applicable to gapped alignments however many kinds of alignments involving gaps were empirically demonstrated to follow evd to derive empirical parameters of ka statistics tens_of of alignments need to be generated and scored this the human query is placed on the branch leading to cow the species_tree shows that the human gene is closer to rat than cow whereas treefam shows that the human gene is actually closer to cow than rat
