to the genetic_basis of complex_diseases including intellectual_disability autism_spectrum o epilepsy and congenital_heart the implication of individual genes in these phenotypes typically requires sequencing of large_numbers of cases and controls molecular inversion probes mips also known as padlock probes have proven successful in a broad range of applications including targeted genotyping dna_sequencing o assessing copy_number and content methylation patterns rna allelotyping and detection of bacteria in clinical samples mips boast low amortized cost per sample and high scalability o characteristics that may allow it to replace sanger_sequencing for clinical genetic_testing we recently built upon the mip assay with the introduction of single_molecule mips or smmips mips with molecular tags to track independent capture events however while genotyping accuracy and sensitivity for detecting low_frequency alleles have been enhanced smmips do not address a key limitation non uniformity of capture efficiencies within probe_sets early large_scale experiments that attempted to optimize targeting arm melting_temperatures demonstrated substantial non uniformity across target_sites with longer exons and gc extremes frequently failing capture dosing mips to compensate for dropout known as repooling enables significantly_enhanced coverage but collecting the empirical data for repooling lowers assay turnaround time and expends sequencing resources previous_studies with mip and long padlock probe lpp assays were limited in their exploration of possible design remedies including choosing only high_performing nucleotides at the mip ligation junction preferring low_copy targeting arm sequences and prioritization based on oligonucleotide melting_temperatures work byincorporated dna folding metrics into the neural_network driven framework ppdesigner and suggests that further modifications to mip design and capture protocols could yield additional gains in coverage uniformity here we describe an empirically trained design algorithm for mip design that attains our goal of optimizing performance and reducing reliance on empirical testing for developing successful smmip assays a set of eight genes that had previously been extensively characterized via mip sequencing_data chd tbl xr tbr dyrk a adnp grin b pten and ctnnb plus an additional high gc target shank were selected to test the models predictions of mip performance both on previously designed mips for these genes o as well as for a newly_designed mipgen set the new design consisted of smmips with complete tiling of the targeted sites which were tested alongside the original mip assay on control dna predictions for the performance of the previous mip designs were correlated with total read_counts for both logistic scoring and svr scoring for smmips tagged read_depth was slightly but not significantly more correlated with mipgen scores than total read_depth p unsurprisingly given this information tagged and untagged read_depths were highly_correlated with each other special_attention was given to mips with of the average coverage per mip as these are largely responsible for gaps in coverage the scores were successful at detecting these low performing mips for both logistic area under_the of and svr support_vector auc models supplementary logistic and svr scores were only slightly more correlated with each other than with total read_depth supplementary we next analyzed the performance of the new mip assay relative to that of the original set to ascertain the success of the new design algorithm average coverage per mip in the new set increased over the original set however the proportion of the targeted bases of the median per base coverage of the replicates remained_unchanged for the original set and for the redesigned set still uniformity of coverage improved with the relative_standard prior design methodologies were relatively modest mipgen scores enable stratification of mip targets a priori and in silico with reasonable discriminatory_power in the future mip scoring may be calibrated with new training_sets that can account for advances in mip protocols or match more specialized conditions that entail dna of variable concentration or quality curated mip smmip designs per gene may be indicated to facilitate comparison across studies and improve access to validated mip smmip assays and surveying mipgen scores prior to committing to a mip target may serve to maximize the economy of a mip target enrichment approach more generally we anticipate that the user_friendly package for mip and smmip design provided in the mipgen package will facilitate its broader use in both research and clinical_applications
