modeling and analyzing complex biological_networks incooperating experimental information on both network_topology and stable_states motivation linking the topology of a complex network to its long_term behavior is a basic problem in network_theory which has been on the focus of many recent research publications to obtain a suitable boolean model for a biological system one must analyze the initial model and compare it with other experimental_evidence and if necessary make adjustments by changing the topology of the wiring diagram however our knowledge on how to link the topology of a network to its long_term behavior is very limited due to the complexity of the problem since the need to consider complex biological_networks has become ever greater develop both theoretical_foundation and algorithms for model_selection and analysis has been brought to the forefront of biological_network study results this article proposes a novel method to study intrinsically the relationship between experimental_data and the possible boolean_networks which can be used to model the underlying system simple and easy to use criteria for a boolean_network to have both a given network_topology and a given set of stable_states are derived these criteria can be used to guide the selection of a boolean_network for the system as well as to gain information on the intrinsic_properties such as the robustness and the evolvability of the system a boolean model for the_fruit is used to explain the method boolean_networks were introduced as random models of genetic_regulatory to study biological_systems by and in recent_years we have seen a rapid increase of applications of boolean_networks to modeling and analyzing biological_systems as well as a rapid increase of research_activities aim at developing foundational theories and algorithms for boolean_networks to address questions arise from biological_applications see for example davidson and levine karlebach and shamir purnick and tomlin and axelrod and the references therein the construction of a boolean model for a biological system such as a gene_regulatory is based on the experimental_evidence on the interactions among the genes to whom correspondence should be addressed the interactions among the genes are specified by the lines arrows mean activations and blunts mean inhibitions to distinguish the different actions of the genes among themselves and to make it clear from the diagram which of the logical operations and should be used in formulating the updating functions two copies of each of the genes wg wg ptc and ptc were drawn with the assumption that the identical copies were to be combined by the logical operation more details are provided in the supplementary_material the data can be integrated into a diagram which is similar to an electrical wiring diagram and logical functions that define a boolean_network for the biological system can then be formulated according to the topology how it is wired of the diagram for a system that only partial information was obtained through experiments the choice of a boolean_network for the system is nonunique assumptions must be made in order to construct a wiring diagram and linking the topology of the wiring diagram to the stable_states of the network constructed from it becomes crucial if the system under consideration is small then we can use the exhaustive method to study the system effectively for systems occurring in biology which are typically large developing general_theory to guide our study is important however for complex systems only in some special cases we have a clear picture of how to derive information on the long_term behavior of a network from the topology of the corresponding wiring diagram here we briefly_review some recent_publications that are relevant to this study studied a family of boolean_networks for which each updating function see section for definition is given by a monomial a method to derive the dynamical_properties of such a boolean_network from the structure of the monomials that define the network was derived there and thus
