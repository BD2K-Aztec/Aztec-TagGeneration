genome_analysis genomevista an integrated software_package for whole_genome alignment and visualization with the ubiquitous generation of complete genome_assemblies for a variety of species efficient tools for whole_genome alignment along with user_friendly visualization are critically_important our vista family of tools for comparative_genomics based on algorithms for pairwise and multiple_alignments of genomic_sequences and whole genome_assemblies has become one of the standard techniques for comparative_analysis most of the vista programs have been implemented as web accessible servers and are extensively used by the biomedical community in this manuscript we introduce genomevista a novel implementation that incorporates most features of the vista familyfast and accurate alignment visualization capabilities gui and analytical_tools within a stand alone software_package genomevista thus provides flexibility and security for users who need to conduct whole_genome comparisons on their own computers availability_and implemented in perl c c and java the source_code is freely_available for download at the vistacomparing genomic_sequences across related species has become a source of invaluable data on the functional_elements in various genomes there are a number of individual programs developed separately for genome alignment and visualization of comparative information but few programs and web_servers integrate the two giving researchers an opportunity to analyze results interactively vista dcode org the pipmaker suite of tools and mauve are some examples of such integration vista online servers provide a wide_range of services which allow a user to align and compare sequences from multiple species up to mb long using different algorithms locate regulatory_sequences using comparative_sequence and transcription_factor search compare users sequences against whole genome_assemblies and browse pre_computed alignments of hundreds of microbial fungal plant vertebrate and other genomes comparative results can be examined through a highly interactive graphic_user gui featuring the visualization of the level of conservation in the format of a continuous vista curve based on the conservation in a sliding_window this concept proved to be extremely successful owing to the easy interpretation of the resulting plots a novel stand alone software genomevista integrates all well established popular features of the vista family of tools in one package and provides users the opportunity to carry out comparative_analysis of whole genomes on their own computers allowing for more flexibility and security of computations it runs an extensively tested and recently improved alignment algorithm simultaneously the built in interactive gui allows real_time examination of results of the comparative_analysis vista point a novel visualization program is provided as a part of the genomevista package
