genetics_and flapjack graphical genotype visualization new software_tools for graphical genotyping are required that can routinely handle the large data_volumes generated by the high_throughput single_nucleotide snp platforms genotyping by sequencing and other comparable genotyping technologies flapjack has been developed to facilitate analysis of these data providing real_time rendering with rapid navigation and comparisons between lines markers and chromosomes with visualization sorting and querying based on associated data such as phenotypes quantitative_trait or other mappable features availability flapjack is freely_available for microsoft windows mac os x linux and solaris and can be downloaded fromthe concept of a graphical genotype to visualize haplotype diversity between chromosomes has been widely_adopted since young andused it in the context of restriction_fragment rflp mapping populations existing software_tools to display graphical genotypes include ggt van and geneflow geneflowinc com the advent of new highthroughput genotyping technologies have given a renewed stimulus to the concept of graphical genotyping through a combination of dramatic reduction in cost per data point and vastly increased marker_density and throughput the resultant high_density data underpin new genetic_approaches such as genome_wide it also leads to the possibility of visually comparing many lines e g samples or individuals or sorting and selecting based on phenotype identified groupings and genome features such as quantitative_trait qtl or gene models mapped to the genetic or physical genome however the ability to generate datasets with many thousands of markers on many thousands of lines imposes a significant demand on both software_tools and the underlying computer hardware flapjack provides a high performance visual interface into graphical genotyping applications in genetics and plant breeding to whom correspondence should be addressed
