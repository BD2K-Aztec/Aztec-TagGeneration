idba ud a de_novo assembler for single_cell and metagenomic sequencing_data with highly uneven depth motivation next_generation allows us to sequence_reads from a microbial environment using single_cell or metagenomic sequencing_technologies however both technologies suffer from the problem that sequencing_depth of different regions of a genome or genomes from different species are highly uneven most existing genome_assemblers usually have an assumption that sequencing_depths are even these assemblers fail to construct correct long contigs results we introduce the idba ud algorithm that is based on the de_bruijn approach for assembling reads from single_cell or metagenomic sequencing_technologies with uneven sequencing_depths several non trivial techniques have been employed to tackle the problems instead of using a simple threshold we use multiple depthrelative thresholds to remove erroneous k_mers in both low depth and high depth regions the technique of local_assembly with paired_end information is used to solve the branch problem of low depth short repeat regions to speed up the process an error_correction step is conducted to correct reads of high depth regions that can be aligned to highconfident contigs comparison of the performances of idba ud and existing assemblers velvet velvet sc soapdenovo and meta idba for different datasets shows that idba ud can reconstruct longer contigs with higher accuracy availability the idba ud toolkit is available at our websitesince over of microbes cannot be cultivated single_cell and metagenomic sequencing_technologies are used to study these microbes single_cell sequencing_technology amplifies and sequences genome of an individual cell without cultivation since the amplification_bias the sequencing_depths at different regions of the genome can be extremely uneven metagenomic_sequencing studies a microbe community as a whole and has similar problem of uneven sequencing_depths of genomes because different species in a sample have different abundances almost all existing de_novo tools were designed for single_genome with uniform sequencing_depth and were used by some recent_studies on microbes to whom correspondence should be addressed to evaluate the performance of our algorithm experiments all experiments were done on a machine with core ghz intel cpu and gb_memory the tested assembler was run with multiple threads if it supports are carried_out on several datasets with different properties results on existing general_purpose assemblers like velvet soapdenovo idba and special purpose assemblers like velvet sc meta idba were compared different k values were tried for each assembler and the result with best performance are shown and compared two most important statistics n and coverage are calculated to evaluate the contiguity and completeness of assembly results n is the length of the longest contig such that all the contigs longer than this contig cover at least half of the genome being assembled coverage is the proportion of the genome being covered by output contigs in this article only correct contigs are considered in the calculation of n and coverage a contig is considered as correct if it can be aligned to the genome reference by blat with similarity for correct contigs the substitution_errors are computed by comparing the alignment between contigs and genome reference for unaligned contigs the number of contigs and the number of bases are recorded for comparison
