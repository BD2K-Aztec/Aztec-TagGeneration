simtoolbox a matlab toolbox for structured illumination fluorescence_microscopy simtoolbox is an open_source modular set of functions for matlab equipped with a user_friendly graphical_interface and designed for processing two_dimensional and three_dimensional data acquired by structured illumination microscopy sim both optical_sectioning and super_resolution applications are supported the software is also capable of maximum a posteriori probability image estimation map sim an alternative method for reconstruction of structured illumination images map sim can potentially reduce reconstruction artifacts which commonly occur due to refractive_index mismatch within the sample and to imperfections in the illumination availability_and simtoolbox example data and the online documentation are freely_accessible atin structured illumination microscopy sim a sequence of images is acquired each taken with a different position of an illumination pattern in a fluorescence_microscope but without a mask in the detection path subsequent processing of the raw_data is required to reconstruct the final image current sim methods include optical_sectioning microscopy os sim and super_resolution sim sr sim several different algorithms can be used to process sim data simtoolbox offers a set of matlab functions for processing both os sim and sr sim data according to a variety of methods simtoolbox can also apply an alternative method for processing the data maximum a posteriori probability estimation map sim the tools can be accessed from a user_friendly graphical_user our goal is to offer a collection of processing methods which were developed based on extensive testing with real_data the software can be used to process data acquired by commercial sim systems however some of the tools and documentation provided are meant for researchers developing their own systems in addition to the software we provide example data a users guide and a detailed_description of the implemented methods and algorithms please refer to the supplementary note for further details
