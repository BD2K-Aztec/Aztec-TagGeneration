data_and support_vector model of developmental brain gene_expression data for prioritization of autism risk gene_candidates motivation autism_spectrum asd are a group of neurodevelopmental_disorders with clinical_heterogeneity and a substantial polygenic component high_throughput methods for asd risk gene identification produce numerous candidate_genes that are time consuming and expensive to validate prioritization methods can identify high_confidence candidates previous asd gene_prioritization methods have focused on a priori_knowledge which excludes genes with little functional_annotation or no protein product such as long_non lncrnas results we have developed a support_vector svm model trained using brain developmental gene_expression data for the classification and prioritization of asd risk genes the selected feature model had a mean accuracy of mean specificity of and mean sensitivity of gene_lists comprised of an asd risk gene and adjacent genes were ranked using the models decision function output the known asd risk genes were ranked on average in the th th and th_percentile for sets of and genes respectively of lncrna genes were classified as asd associated candidates with a confidence greater than genes previously associated with brain development and neurodevelopmental_disorders were prioritized highly within the lncrna gene_list autism_spectrum asd is the umbrella_term for the neurodevelopmental_disorders autistic_disorder aspergers syndrome pervasive_developmental not otherwise specified rett_syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder it is generally diagnosed at an age greater than four years old based predominantly on the behavioral phenotype described as delayed communication difficulty acknowledging social cues and engaging in repetitive_behaviors in the centers_for cdc estimated the prevalence of asd at in children_aged and this was an increase from the estimate of in the increase in prevalence may be attributable to more public_awareness and implementation of prescreening technology twin and sibling studies indicate that asd etiology is influenced heavily by genetics and to a lesser extent environmental_factors the actual physiological cause of asd is currently unknown but leading theories include imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory_synapses and substandard signaling between brain_structures due to poor axonal_growth it is possible that a myriad of genetic_and could lead to distinct physiological_conditions convergent on the behavioral phenotype asd is complex with hundreds of genes implicated in its etiology the predominant focus of previous_research has been on protein_coding and there is the potential of more genes such as non coding_genes being implicated as well disease_gene studies are usually large_scale and high_throughput examples_include genome_wide gwas copy_number studies cnv and whole_exome wes these studies in themselves are time consuming and expensive especially when considering the sample_size required for an effective study the output can contain numerous potential candidate_genes which are also expensive_and to validate with minimal impact on risk of the disease itself gwas_studies have been shown to be particularly susceptible to weak snp associations for asd disease_gene systems seek to determine the confidence for disease association amongst gene_lists while disease_gene methods have become somewhat ubiquitous they generally do not have methodologies accounting for prioritization of non coding_genes support_vector svm approaches have previously been applied to asd research provided support for a phenotype genotype relationship by using symptom profiles as features and genetic_disorders as classes for a multi class extension of svm magnetic_resonance mri offers one of the most potentially fruitful routes for asd diagnostics and svm approaches have been applied to mri data to classify and further characterize the morphology of the disorder used svm to determine differences in the morphologies between young male_and patients with asd a similar method was employed byon whole brain structural imaging to reveal a correlation for the distance from the decision boundary and the severity of the disorder in this study we have developed a machine_learning to prioritize genes for asd risk based on domain specific knowledge of asd it is hypothesized that expression_patterns offer a potential means of prioritization for all gene types for asd risk in particular we design the novel approach of using the normal developmental brain expression_patterns found in the brainspan dataset to leverage previous_research focused primarily on protein_coding to classify asd risk gene_candidates the validity of this approach is supported by weighted gene coexpression network_analysis on the brainspan dataset which has shown convergence of asd risk genes on developmental_pathways it is further supported by evidence of the potential role in asd of lncrnas whose function is closely_linked with their expression_patterns in this study we first generated a gene_list of high_confidence developmental asd risk genes we were then able to create a support_vector svm model for asd risk gene prediction with a accuracy capable of prioritizing asd candidate_genes based solely on expression_patterns in the developing_brain utilizing a wrapper methodology and a best first search method during feature_selection we were able to drastically reduce the dimensionality and identify biologically_relevant and novel temporospatial features within the dataset the performance of the feature subset showed improvement over the full feature_set to further test our model we used the asd risk gene_list to generate hypothetical loci similar to what would be expected from an association study the genes within the loci were prioritized to determine the relative rank within the list of the known risk gene finally the model was applied to the prioritization of long_non lncrna genes overall the study demonstrates the effective application of a machine_learning approach to asd risk gene identification using normal_tissue expression_patterns autism_spectrum asd has a complex physiologic etiology combinations of environmental_and causing aberrant development of brain_regions have been linked to the disorder studies utilizing non_invasive brain imaging_procedures such as magnetic_resonance mri and positronic emission tomography pet have also implicated brain_structures and biological_processes contributing to asd while the underlying_mechanisms remain_poorly there is a large body of knowledge in the field to be utilized for further study although treatment of asd has been shown to be effective it is dependent on early detection imaging can offer diagnostic input but the process is expensive and not always practical biomarkers may offer the best means for early detection of the disorder but the complexity of the disorder and the increase in sequencing capacity have led to a multitude of potential targets too numerous to test the need for an asd risk gene_prioritization system encompassing all gene types is evident in this study we employ a novel approach to bridging this gap by reframing the task of asd risk gene identification as a supervised machine learning_problem we were able to construct an accurate classification model leveraging the existing extensive research on protein_coding in asd and the comprehensive view of the transcriptome for the developing human_brain offered by the brainspan dataset we were able to discern a pattern from the expression_profile which distinguishes asd risk genes appling a heuristic_search through the possible feature_space we were alsothree different gene_set sizes were tested for the hypothetical loci the selected and full feature_set svm models for the three gene_set sizes for each hypothetical locus the percentile rank of the known asd risk gene within the gene_list was calculated and here those ranks are grouped in percentile point increments able to refine the model through feature_selection which improved_performance and implicated potentially critical temporospatial features in the onset of asd to test the performance of our model in the absence of an independent test_set we used both standard crossvalidations and the prioritization of candidate_genes within hypothetical loci the performance_measures confirmed that the model achieved high_accuracy and had the capability to highly prioritize asd risk genes within gene_lists of varying lengths in light of the gathering evidence that lncrnas are associated with asd we further demonstrated the utility of our model through the prioritization of lncrna candidates biologically_significant candidates were highly prioritized providing further validation to our approach collectively the feature subset has interesting aspects it is intriguing that while asd as early developmental_disorders can be diagnosed by the age of two years old with standard methods american psychiatric the developmental time points of the selected_features span the entirety of the transcriptome studied from pcw to years of age most notably the time points are enriched for early development particularly from pcw to one year of age and these points were predominantly added to the subset before later developmental time points such as those greater than four years of age therefore the early developmental_period appears to have a larger influence on asd risk gene identification co expression modules enriched with asd risk genes have been shown to have either dramatic upward or downward trends in expression_patterns between pcw to one year of age which indicates a critical timespan in relation to asd etiology not surprisingly the structures that were selected are mainly cortical_regions which are associated with sensory_input processing and behavior generally cortical_regions have been found to be enlarged in children with asd around three years of age two non cortical_regions selected are the hippocampus and the mediodorsal nucleus of thalamus md both the hippocampus and the thalamus have been found to be proportionately smaller for individuals between the ages of four and eighteen years old with asd however there is little to no evidence of a role for the md in asd the selected feature_set also contained later development cortical_structures these unanticipated features may present new avenues of research for asd in this study a novel approach is proposed for knowledge_transfer from known asd risk protein_coding to all gene types we have demonstrated that a model built using only expression_patterns within normal brain development as features can accurately classify and prioritize asd risk genes this provides a distinct advantage over previous_models it does not require a priori_knowledge and allows for the prioritization of non protein_coding it is our hope that this will lay the groundwork for an accurate prioritization tool utilizing this model autism risk gene
