systems_biology the power of protein_interaction for associating genes with diseases motivation understanding the association between genetic_diseases and their causal_genes is an important problem concerning human_health with the recent influx of high_throughput data_describing interactions between gene_products scientists have been provided a new avenue through which these associations can be inferred despite the recent interest in this problem however there is little understanding of the relative_benefits and drawbacks underlying the proposed techniques results we assessed the utility of physical protein interactions for determining genedisease_associations by examining the performance of seven recently_developed computational_methods plus several of their variants we found that random_walk approaches individually outperform clustering and neighborhood approaches although most methods make predictions not made by any other method we show how combining these methods into a consensus method yields pareto optimal_performance we also quantified how a diffuse topological distribution of disease_related negatively_affects prediction quality and are thus able to identify diseases especially amenable to network based_predictions and others for which additional information_sources are absolutely required availability the predictions made by each algorithm considered are available online atto understand the molecular basis of genetic_diseases it is important to discover their causal_genes typically a disease is associated with a linkage interval on the chromosome if single_nucleotide snps in the interval are correlated with an increased susceptibility to the disease these linkage intervals define a set of candidate diseasecausing genes genes related to the same disease are also known to have protein products that physically interact a class of computational_approaches have recently been proposed to whom correspondence should be addressed that exploit these two sources of informationphysical interaction networks and linkage intervalsto predict associations between genes and diseases previous_studies typically begin with an artificial disease subinterval and test how well they can identify a known causal gene from among a fixed number of nearby genes in the query subinterval in this article instead of ranking only genes in the subinterval we rank all genes in all intervals related to a query disease this more stringent approach is advantageous because it allows us to find disease_causing that lie in existing disease intervals but that were previously not associated with the disease consequently we can gauge a genes relatedness to any query disease several techniques for uncovering genedisease_associations take an integrative approach leveraging gene_ontology gene_expression protein_sequence biological_pathways text_mining transcription_factor and various phenotypic_traits of diseases recent_studies that network based_predictions can be of comparable quality with current integrative approaches we focus here on isolating proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks and linkage intervals to determine how much information is readily extractable from them for predicting genedisease_associations any improved network based analysis can subsequently be incorporated into a more comprehensive integrative system we compare approaches based on direct network neighbors and neighborhood unsupervised graph partitioning graph summarization gs and markov_clustering mcl semi_supervised graph partitioning vi cut random_walks and network flow plus several of their variants seeand section trends in the precision and recall achieved by these computational_methods yield several insights about the utility of ppi_networks for uncovering genedisease_associations we find that random walkapproaches outperform all other tested classes of methodologies with performance ranging from high_precision and low recall and respectively to low precision and mediocre recall and respectively based on the parameters used the graph clustering_methods which have not previously been tested in this domain mostly perform better than the neighborhood approaches when only using linkage intervals without the network we find substantially lower performance as is the case when using only the network without linkage intervals however in this latter scenario graph clustering_methods can be more precise than the other methodologies this suggests that the proper choice of method and parameters depends on the setting we also quantify the relationship between the quality of predictions for a disease and the topological distribution of its related proteins in the network as one would expect we obtain better results for diseases whose proteins are situated near one another in the network the measured relationship between closeness homophily and performance can be used to estimate precision and recall per disease a priori the lower precision observed on diseases whose genes are spread apart in the network also suggests that making high_quality predictions for these diseases warrants the integration of more information_sources and is where future computational efforts should be directed we compare the actual predictions made by each method and find that most methods make some correct predictions not made by any other method and that there are very few incorrect predictions made by multiple methods consequently we show that combining these methods using a consensus random_forest results in pareto optimal_performance given the wide_range of approaches considered the consensus method may be considered the current performance of the network itself for determining genedisease_associations the classes of network based_methods considered here each approached the task of predicting genedisease_associations using very different philosophies although random_walk approaches are superior to clustering and neighborhood approaches we showed that all methods make unique predictions and can be used together to increase performance we also quantified the relationship between disease homophily and prediction quality and found certain diseases for which high_throughput ppi_networks were an especially useful source from which to make high_quality predictions diseases that have little correlation with the interaction_network call for higher quality networks or an integrative approach that considers sequence functional_annotations expression data or other additional information funding national_science
