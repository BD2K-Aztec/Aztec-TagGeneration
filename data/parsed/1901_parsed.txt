functional association networks as priors for gene_regulatory motivation gene_regulatory grn_inference reveals the influences genes have on one another in cellular regulatory_systems if the experimental_data are inadequate for reliable inference of the network informative priors have been shown to improve the accuracy of inferences results this study explores the potential of undirected confidence weighted networks such as those in functional association databases as a prior source for grn_inference such networks often erroneously indicate symmetric interaction between genes and may contain mostly correlation based interaction information despite these drawbacks our testing on synthetic datasets indicates that even noisy priors reflect some causal information that can improve grn_inference accuracy our analysis on yeast data indicates that using the functional association databases funcoup and string as priors can give a small improvement in grn_inference accuracy with biological data gene_regulatory grn_inference determines causal influences in gene_networks and is useful for understanding regulation usually at the transcriptional level which can hypothetically lead to effective modification of regulatory_networks grn_inference has been studied extensively over the past_decade as described in the following reviews tegn er and bj orkegren in grns the nodes are genes and the edges are influences annotated with a direction and signed strength these networks are normally constructed using transcriptomic_data from experiments in which all of the genes in the network of interest have been perturbed often with rnai knockdowns gene_expression is profiled either in a time series or when the system has reached a steady_state a plethora of inference methods have been developed and are based on information_theory boolean_networks bayesian_networks and ordinary_differential odes gustafsson and h ornquist a subset of the methods based on a ode description formulates the inference as a convex programming problem the dialogue on reverse_engineering assessment and methods dream and other benchmarking studies have shown that although many methods perform better than random there is a lot of room for improvement it is difficult to determine the true grn for a biological system because even if major characteristics such as transcription_factor binding are known subtle influences may not be well understood to avoid this problem many benchmarking studies use synthetic data where the true grn is known and the accuracy of inference methods can be analysed genenetweaver gnw generated synthetic networks and datasets for three of the dream competitions and this program uses nonlinear dynamical_models of transcription and translation another synthetic data generation program genespider manuscript in preparation uses a linear dynamical_model of transcription these two programs were used in our study to generate synthetic data prior_knowledge may be incorporated into the inference_method in order to improve accuracy and can also increase efficiency by reducing the search_space researchers have begun to explore these possibilities by using pathways transcription_factor binding gustafsson and h ornquist shih and proteinprotein_interactions gene_ontology epigenetics and literature these studies incorporate the prior in different ways but for inference methods which minimize a penalty function the prior_knowledge is often quantified as the unlikelihood of a link and this value is multiplied by the sparsity term in the penalty function gustafsson and h ornquist the prior value has also been discretized to be positive negative or zero and used as a constraint in an optimization although there have been several studies none of them has been good enough to become a widespread standard a comprehensive user_friendly prior can be constructed using functional association data undirected confidence weighted to

two genes one good place to find such data is in functional association databases which aggregate heterogeneous experimental_data and output a confidence_score describing the probability of a functional linkage between two proteins funcoup and the search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes string are two examples of such databases which aggregate data from literature protein interactions genomics orthology coexpression and subcellular_localization in order to calculate the probability of a functional association although these databases pairwise confidence_scores were not created to be priors for grn_inference they may contain enough information to improve grn accuracy the pairwise confidence_scores from functional association databases can be used to create an undirected confidenceweighted likelihood matrix that can be easily incorporated as a prior into a grn inference_method used first generation functional association databases prolinks and predictome as part of a gene biclustering algorithm but not explicitly in the network_inference to our knowledge no one has extensively_studied the potential of undirected unsigned confidenceweighted networks as priors for grn_inference in this study we generated synthetic datasets of steady_state expression data and functional association like priors assumed a dynamical_systems model and used a convex_optimization based inference_method we compared the accuracy of the grn inferences with and without the priors to determine if and when undirected unsigned confidence weighted networks improve grn_inference we also explored a few different experimental perturbation designs to see if they had an impact on the priors usefulness finally we applied our method to a yeast dataset and used funcoup and string to generate priors to see if they can improve network_inference with biological data in the synthetic analysis we generated true networks and expression datasets covering experimental_designs using nonlinear gnw and linear gsp generation methods we used these datasets along with priors covering different i accuracy levels and completed over million inferences to determine if and when a functional association prior improves grn_inference since we were unable to find a method to optimally set our sparsity parameter we evaluated the inference accuracy over all sparsity levels except self interactions were always non zero there were five networks used in the analysis and since their individual results were similar we have only shown the combined results also there was never a perfect inference the best inference recovered of the links so there was always room for improvement a perfect prior never resulted in a perfect inference because of noise and the fact that these priors are symmetrical i e that do not give interaction direction and our true networks were not symmetrical in the results below improvement is defined as the inference accuracy percentage of the method using the simulated functional association prior minus the inference accuracy percentage of the method using the na ve prior
