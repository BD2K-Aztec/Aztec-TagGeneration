integrating sequence expression and interaction data to determine condition specific mirna regulation motivation micrornas mirnas are small_non that regulate_gene post_transcriptionally mirnas were shown to play_an in development and disease and accurately determining the networks regulated by these mirnas in a specific condition is of great interest early work on mirna_target has focused on using static sequence_information more recently researchers have combined sequence and expression data to identify such targets in various conditions results we developed the protein interaction based microrna modules pimim a regression_based probabilistic_method that integrates sequence expression and interaction data to identify modules of mrnas controlled by small sets of mirnas we formulate an optimization_problem and develop a learning framework to determine the module regulation and membership applying pimim to cancer data we show that by adding protein interaction data and modeling cooperative regulation of mrnas by a small number of mirnas pimim can accurately identify both mirna and their targets improving on previous methods we next used pimim to jointly analyze a number of different types of cancers and identified both common and cancer_type mirna regulators
