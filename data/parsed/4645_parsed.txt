the structural effects of mutations can aid in differential phenotype prediction of beta_myosin myosin missense_variants motivation high_throughput are increasingly used to screen patients with genetic disease for pathogenic_mutations but prediction of the effects of mutations remains_challenging previously we developed saapdap single amino_acid polymorphism data analysis_pipeline and saappred single amino_acid polymorphism predictor that use a combination of rule_based structural measures to predict whether a missense genetic_variant is pathogenic here we investigate whether the same methodology can be used to develop a differential phenotype predictor which once a mutation has been predicted as pathogenic is able to distinguish between phenotypesin this case the two major clinical_phenotypes hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy hcm and dilated_cardiomyopathy dcm associated with mutations in the beta_myosin myh gene_product myosin results a random_forest predictor trained on rule_based structural_analyses together with structural clustering data gave a matthews correlation_coefficient mcc of accuracy a post_hoc removal of machine_learning that performed particularly badly increased the performance mcc acc this proof_of suggests that methods used for pathogenicity prediction can be extended for use in differential phenotype prediction availability_and analyses were implemented in perl and c and used the java_based weka machine learning_environment please contact the authors for availability contactsmutations in proteins generally result in loss of function but in some cases can lead to a gain of function generally this is not gain of a novel function but an increased activity often through loss of some type of control mechanism in general predictors of pathogenicity do not try to distinguish between loss of function and gain_of but simply predict whether or not there will be some effect on function leading to a pathogenic state in some cases however the situation is more complex with mutations in a single protein leading to a number of distinct phenotypes for example inherited heart muscle_diseases or cardiomyopathies which are a major cause of sudden_cardiac in the young and an important cause of heart_failure at all ages are as a group very heterogeneous in genotype and phenotype radically different phenotypes can result from mutations in the same gene the widespread application of single_nucleotide snp_chips and high_throughput has generated an urgent need for informatics tools that can help predict the effects of the many sequence_variants that these platforms identify more than groups have devised methods to predict whether a given mutation will have a deleterious_effect al gonz alez prez and l opez bigas the best known methods being sift an evolutionary method which calculates a sophisticated residue conservation score from multiple_alignment and polyphen which uses machine_learning on a set of eight sequence and three structurebased features a more complete list of methods is provided on our web_site at http www bioinf org uk saap methods however these tools are generally not validated for individual diseases where most available datasets are too small to train machine_learning and tend to be heavily unbalanced an additional problem is that it is often very difficult to obtain reliable validated data on neutral mutations one of the few cases where a predictor has been produced for an individual class of proteins is the work on voltage_gated by attempting to distinguish between mutations in a single protein that result in different pathogenic phenotypes is a difficult problem that unlike pathogenicity prediction has not been widely addressed there have been a small number of attempts to distinguish loss offunction and gain_of at a molecular level but as stated above typically gain_of result from loss of regulation making the protein constitutively_active for example mutations that cause the vab tyrosine_kinase to become constitutively_active cause severe axon defects some of the challenges in the comparative_assessment of genome interpretation cagi experiment have required the prediction of the level of enzyme_activity e g genomeinterpretation org content naglu and some have been related to familial combined hyperlipidemia or channelopathies genomeinterpretation org content fch genomeinterpretation org content scn a but to our knowledge there have been no clear cases where predictions have focused on mutations in the same protein resulting in different phenotypes other than through loss of function versus loss of regulation initially our own focus was on trying to understand the effects that mutations have on protein_structure and then to use this information to compare the effects of non pathogenic_mutations and pathogenic deviations our approach has been to map mutations onto protein_structure and to perform a rulebased analysis of the likely structural effects of these mutations in order to explain the known functional effect if any of the mutation since we map mutations to structure we only consider mutations in proteins for which a structure has been solved with the recent growth in the amount of mutation data we have moved from updating a database of analysis of mutations to providing a server saapdapsingle amino_acid polymorphism data analysis_pipeline for analysis of the effects of mutations http www bioinf org uk saap dap the approach has been used to study structural_differences between disease_causing and neutral polymorphisms al and to analyze mutations in glucose_phosphate and in the tumour_suppressor p while saapdap uses a combination of rule_based structural measures to assess whether a mutation is likely to alter the local structural environment we have also developed saappred single amino_acid polymorphism predictor which exploits the results of the structural analysis and uses a random_forest machine_learning to predict whether mutations are pathogenic al saappred is restricted to analyzing mutations in proteins for which a native_structure is available but appears to outperform methods such as sift polyphen and fathmm in this paper we investigate whether having predicted a mutation as being pathogenic the approach that we developed for saapdap and saappred can be used for differential phenotype prediction specifically for mutations in the beta_myosin myosin uniprotkb swissprot accession p http www uni prot org uniprot p encoded by the myh gene omim mutations in myh lead to a number of phenotypes the most common being hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy hcm omim and dilated_cardiomyopathy dcm omim the numbers of mutations available for other phenotypes are very small and consequently for this proof_of paper we have attempted to distinguish just between hcm and dcm myosin is part of the force generating molecular_motor of the sarcomere and parts of the structure have been solved it is divided_into three main domains as shown in supplementary a globular head which includes the atp_binding and the actinbinding site the neck which is composed of an a helical domain to which the myosin_light bind and which is further subdivided into a converter region and a lever_arm involved in the amplification of mechanical_energy and the tail or rod region together with mybpc the gene_encoding myosin binding_protein c mutations in myh are the major cause of hcm as well as being a cause of dcm and left_ventricular lvnc in contrast to mybpc where most pathogenic_variants cause mrna and protein truncation the large majority of myh variants are missense which often makes prediction of pathogenicity problematic it is logical to assume that the functional consequences of mutations in the same gene depend on the specific domain or region where thethe highest significance result is shown in bold for the p value to be reliable there must be no more than of expected counts less than five consequently the p values for clusters will be over estimated clustering myosin mutations in the n_terminal region using pdb_file db for the three clusters hcm mutations are shown in red green and blue while dcm mutations are shown in orange yellow and cyan dcm mutations are over represented in cluster cyan when they appear in clusters and orange and yellow they are mostly buried variant is localized but the hypothesis that the structural impact of a missense_variant influences differential pathogenic phenotype or outcome has not previously been tested in practice a novel mutation would be tested for predicted pathogenicity before an hcm dcm prediction was performed we confirmed that the saappred approach performs well in identifying pathogenic_mutations in myh and went on to test a machinelearning method that discriminated between pathogenic_variants associated with an hcm or dcm phenotype accuracy of and mcc this was achieved by averaging machinelearning models using feature_set binding relaccess surfacephobic corephilic voids mutantlargestvoid nativelargestvoid clash proline cispro and clustering and using trees with features these differential phenotype prediction results are surprisingly good considering the limited size of the dataset used in training indeed the results are as good as the overall performance of some methods used for general pathogenicity predictionfor example our assessment al of mutationassessor showed an overall accuracy of and mcc while sift showed an overall accuracy of and mcc clearly these results are comparable with what we are able to achieve for hcm dcm differential phenotype prediction which is a more difficult problem owing to the small unbalanced dataset by removing two machine_learning that performed particularly badly the performance was increased to an accuracy of and mcc because the saapdap structural analysis relies on having a crystal_structure of the protein in question our predictions are limited to mutations in regions of the protein for which a structure has been solved consequently we are only able to look at of unique mutations leading to hcm and of mutations leading to dcm as structures become available for more of the protein then this situation will improve and some new structures have become available since our dataset was built however for mutations that are present in disordered_regions of structure different methods of prediction will be required it is also possible that the performance of the method may be further improved by taking_into missing parts of the structure however since all the structural_parameters included in the prediction are the results of local_interactions this is unlikely to have a significant effect our analysis of the structural distribution of hcm and dcmassociated mutations showed that there was a highly statistically_significant in the locations of these mutations referring toand supplementary dcm is highly overrepresented in the blue cyan cluster and largely on the surface while dcm mutations present in the remaining clusters are mostly buried the functional consequences of this distribution warrant further in vitro studies
