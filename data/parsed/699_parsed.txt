bdvis visualizing biodiversity data in r biodiversity studies are relying increasingly on primary biodiversity records pbrs for modelling and analysis because biodiversity data are frequently harvestedi e not collected by the researcher for that particular study but obtained from data aggregators such as the global biodiversity information facilityresearchers need to be aware of strengths_and of their data before they venture into further analysis r is becoming a lingua franca of data exploration and analysis here we describe an r package bdvis which facilitates efforts to understand the gaps and strengths of pbr data with quick and useful visualization functions availability_and the full code of the r package bdvis along with instructions on how to install and use it is available via cran the comprehensive r archive networkbiodiversity studies are in focus because of the perceived_risk of mass extinction due to rapid environmental changes in recent_years most studies rely on primary biodiversity records pbr which are basically records of species occurrences in a specific place at a specific time pbr are being used to study almost every aspect of human endeavor from basic needs like food and shelter to science and politics publications citing data served by the global biodiversity information facility gbif currently the most preeminent network of pbr institutions cover diverse areas like invasive alien_species climate_change effects conservation human_health agriculture etc http www gbif org mendeley which illustrates broad relevance of pbrs informatics tools are becoming essential in biodiversity science for improved management exploration discovery analysis and presentation of biological and ecological information sober on and challenges that are collectively referred to as biodiversity informatics this is a relatively young but rapidly_growing field whose aim is to leverage current computational_techniques and information_technologies to solve biodiversity problems the solutions to many of the key_challenges rely on availability of sets of large and good enough information more and more pbrs are being made available through aggregators or networks like gbif and vertnet at global scale on regional scales portals like biocase biocase org and indian biodiversity portal indiabiodiversity org are actively serving pbr gbif currently serves more than million pbrs major citizen_science initiatives like ebird ebird org and inaturalist inaturalist org have joined the venture and have greatly fueled the growth of gbif in recent_years however due to the distributed nature of these huge data aggregators spatial taxonomic and temporal gaps may arise when collating the different sources they comprise the package helps in identifying the gaps visualizing data is a powerful technique in the biodiversity informatics domain useful to quickly identify the strengths_and of a dataset especially in terms of geo spatial temporal and taxonomic gaps these assessments help i data rights holders to efficiently invest in improvement of the quality of their dataset and ii users to better understand the existing gaps in the data the r language http www r project org is rapidly becoming the preferred tool for all kinds of data analysis the package ecosystem supported by r is very effective in making reusable functions available to users r has numerous packages that serve an increasing range of purposes several of which are useful for various biodiversity informatics related_tasks like the packages rinat http cran r project org packagerinat rgbif http cran r project org packagergbif or dismo http cran r project org packagedismo however there is a lack of integrative tools for performing gap analysis on biodiversity data in this paper we briefly introduce the bdvis package a tool that aims to bridge that gap
