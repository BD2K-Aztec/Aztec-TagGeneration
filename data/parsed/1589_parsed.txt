environment specific substitution tables improve membrane_protein alignment motivation membrane_proteins are both abundant and important in cells but the small number of solved structures restricts our understanding of them here we consider whether membrane_proteins undergo different substitutions from their soluble counterparts and whether these can be used to improve membrane protein_alignments and therefore improve_prediction of their structure results we construct substitution tables for different environments within membrane_proteins as data is scarce we develop a general metric to assess the quality of these asymmetric tables membrane_proteins show markedly different substitution preferences from soluble_proteins for example substitution preferences in lipid tail contacting parts of membrane_proteins are found to be distinct from all environments in soluble_proteins including buried residues a principal_component of the tables identifies the greatest variation in substitution preferences to be due to changes in hydrophobicity the second largest variation relates to secondary_structure we demonstrate the use of our tables in pairwise sequence to structure alignments also known as threading of membrane_proteins using the fugue alignment program on average in the sequence_identity range alignments are improved by correctly aligned residues compared with alignments made using fugues default substitution tables our alignments also lead to improved structural_models availability substitution tables are available at http www stats ox ac uk proteins resources membrane_proteins constitute of human proteins and are important_drug unfortunately the structures of these proteins are hard to determine as of january there are structures in the protein_data pdb of which fewer than are recognized as membrane_proteins by the pdb tm database even these available structures are highly redundant thus for most membrane_proteins only a sequence is known structural_information must be inferred by modelling structure modelling can broadly be divided_into template free and template based_methods template based modelling makes use of homologous_proteins that are identified as having similar structures to that of the target_sequence proteins are to whom correspondence should be addressed normally considered homologous if they share significant_sequence once a homologous protein with a known structure the template has been identified it is aligned to the target_sequence this alignment between two sequences can be improved by the use of structural_information from the template this sequence tostructure alignment forms the blueprint which coordinate generation programs such as modeller for soluble_proteins or medeller for membrane_proteins use to build a model the accuracy of a model is primarily determined by the quality of the initial alignment the membrane is a radically different environment from the aqueous environment of soluble_proteins most membrane bilayers are composed of phospholipids with hydrophobic tail groups and charged head_groups this suggests for example that substitutions from charged_residues to hydrophobic ones are unlikely in head contacting regions and conversely that substitutions from hydrophobic_residues to charged ones are unlikely in tail contacting regions thus membrane_proteins will have unique_patterns of substitutions however due to lack of data the alignment of membrane_proteins is typically performed with substitution tables optimized for soluble_proteins identifying appropriate tables for membrane environments is expected to improve methods that depend on them particularly for sequenceto structure alignment environment specific substitution tables essts are one of the methods used to align target_sequences with known structures a substitution table tabulates the chances that an amino_acid in one protein is replaced by another in a second protein for example that a glycine residue is replaced by an alanine essts are a set of substitution tables each of which is to be used in a different environment environments are defined by features such as secondary_structure and accessibility essts are used in sequenceto structure alignment as the environments for each residue can be determined from the structure to create an esst substitutions in each environment must be counted between a number of related proteins in early studies tables were constructed by counting substitutions between homologous_proteins of known structure more recently tables have been made by counting substitutions between one structure and many sequences the latter method is used here environment independent substitution tables have previously been made for transmembrane_regions the jtt table appears to be the earliest example with the phat and slim tables following these tables were intended to be used in conjunction with a nonmembrane table such as blosum this bipartitescheme requires a separate algorithm to decide where to use each table sequence_alignment has been attempted using phat with both bad and good results when compared with alignments using only blosum the slim table is optimized for homology detection its authors explicitly caution against using it for alignment two problems complicate the construction of essts for membrane_proteins firstly it is difficult to determine the structural environment of residues even in known membrane structuresalthough secondary_structure and accessible_surface can be determined as for soluble_proteins the location of a residue within the membrane bilayer cannot be inferred from the solved structure alone here we use the annotation program imembrane to determine these contacts secondly once an esst is created it is difficult to assess if it is representative of its environment across all membrane_proteins how can we tell if we have made a good table we describe a metric of esst quality that is robust against perturbations in the observed_frequencies of individual substitutions we create good membrane essts and analogous soluble essts and make global comparisons between them a dendrogram illustrates inter table distances and a principal_component is used to detect the dependence of substitution patterns on environment type membrane environments are found to be far more diverse than soluble_protein environments for example any pair of lipid tail layer environments are more dissimilar than the corresponding pair of soluble environments fugue is a commonly used program to produce sequence to structure alignments with essts we compare several methods for sequence to structure alignment generation default fugue our membrane based fugue a bipartite phat blosum scheme and the sequence to sequence_alignment program muscle our membranespecific essts consistently improve alignment_quality especially at low sequence_identity in the sequence_identity range compared with the next best method the default fugue tables alignments are improved by at least residues whereas only alignments are worsened by the same amount in this range the average improvement per alignment is more residues aligned correctly these alignment improvements are found to lead to corresponding improvements in structure_prediction we have constructed substitution tables for membrane_proteins by aligning single structures to multiple homologous_sequences this
