webstar d a web_server for rna d structural_alignment the webstar d web_server is a user_friendly online interface for the alignment of rna d structures the website takes as input two files each of which can be in either pdb or mmcif format containing the desired structures to align via a pdb code or user upload in return the user is presented with a visualization of the aligned structures in jmol or jsmol along with the corresponding sequence_alignment and the option to download the nucleotide mapping of the structures and a pdb_file containing the aligned superimposed structures availability_and the webstar d is available atit is recently_discovered that noncoding_rnas ncrnas are involved in nearly every cellular_process including gene_expression and other aspects of cellular_metabolism as ncrnas are genetic end_products their functions are implicated primarily by their secondary_and this has motivated an increasing research interest in methods for the comparative_analysis of rna_structures as key evolutionary and functional_relationships between rna_molecules can be inferred from their structural_alignments with the rapidly_growing archive of rna d structures in the protein_data pdb numerous tools have been developed for the alignment of their tertiary_structures such as sara r dalign and lajolla typically these tools utilize the comparison of base_pairing interactions between molecules e g sara r dalign or they encode key structural_features of these molecules such as rna backbones and nucleotide torsion_angles as sequential information that can be further processed e g lajolla star d implements an alternative approach that identifies the consensus of stacks between two rna_molecules and uses this information to constrain the alignment of loop_regions first sub stacks with similar d structures are identified and assembled into conserved stack pairs from which a sparse compatible graph is generated based on the secondary_structure relations and spatial distances then a tree like consensus structure of the two molecules is generated by efficiently finding the maximal clique in the compatible graph finally loop_regions between the two molecules are ordered based on the consensus structure such that a loop region from one rna_structure only needs to be compared to its matching partner from the other structure the stack and loop alignments are then combined into the final_result this approach results in efficient rna d structural_alignment that matches the precision of other state of the art tools here we present the webstar d web_server a web_interface for the alignment of rna d structures that provides the core functionality of star d along with some additional features as ncrnas are involved in numerous_cellular and their functions are implicated by their structures there is a growing interest in tools for the comparative_analysis of rna_structures for this reason we have presented a user_friendly web_server tool for the tertiary_structure alignment of rna_molecules because the underlying star d algorithm takes a fundamentally different approach to chain a and mouse trna pdb rg chain a the topmost container shows the jmol docking of the aligned structures the first and second structures are colored red and blue respectively with aligned regions colored in a darker hue directly below are the options to download the nucleotide mapping the pdb of the docked structures and the sequence_alignment then follows the secondary_structure alignment corresponding to the d structural_alignment rna d structural_alignment than existing_tools webstar d performs faster on alignments of comparable or better quality compared to state of the art tools
