genetics_and an alternative approach to multiple testing for methylation qtl_mapping reduces the proportion of falsely identified cpgs introduction an increasing number of studies investigates the influence of local genetic_variation on dna methylation_levels so_called in cis methylation quantitative_trait meqtls a common multiple testing approach in genome_wide cis meqtl studies limits the false_discovery fdr among all cpgsnp pairs to and reports on cpgs from the significant cpgsnp pairs however a statistical_test for each cpg is not performed potentially increasing the proportion of cpgs falsely reported on here we presented an alternative approach that properly control for multiple testing at the cpg level results we performed cis meqtl mapping for varying window sizes using publicly_available single_nucleotide snp and kb data extracting the cpgs from the significant cpgsnp pairs fdr using a new bait and switch simulation approach we show that up to of the cpgs found in the simulated_data may be false_positive we present an alternative two step multiple testing approach using the simes and benjaminihochberg procedures that does control the fdr among the cpgs as confirmed by the bait and switch simulation this approach indicates the use of window sizes in cis meqtl mapping studies that are significantly_smaller than commonly adopted genome_wide gwass are widely used to uncover the genetic_basis of complex disease disease associated genetic_variants identified in gwass are commonly located in non coding_regions leaving the molecular_mechanism the associations unclear the likely mechanism involves an effect on transcriptional_activity of genes nearby cis or located distantly trans for example by influencing epigenetic_regulation this can be studied by investigating the relationship between genetic_variation and epigenetic_marks including dna_methylation and gene_expression already many studies have reported on associations of specific genetic_variants with variation in gene_expression expression qtl or eqtls and dna_methylation in particular the methylation of cytosines in cpg_dinucleotides e g dna_methylation quantitative_trait or meqtls creating catalogs of meqtls and eqtls will be instrumental in the discovery of genetic mechanisms determining dna_methylation and gene_expression the possible interplay between the two and eventually the etiology of common diseases to achieve_this further development of sound statistical methodology will be important typically in meqtl and eqtl studies a gwas i e testing hundreds of thousands to millions of single_nucleotide snps is performed for the level of methylation of every cpg measured or the level of transcription of every gene more generally for every transcript or exon respectively leading to a vast amount of possible combinations to investigate although we will focus on cis meqtl studies we note that the same principles and problems may also apply to cis eqtl studies with the recent introduction of the illumina k dna_methylation array meqtl studies have become possible investigating thousand cpgs in large_numbers of subjects to test for associations of methylation at cpgs with genetic_variants in cis that is locally studies have been considering snps anywhere between gutierrez to kb from measured cpgs particularly large window sizes will result in hundreds of millions statistical_tests and thus brings about a huge multiple_testing a common strategy to account for multiple testing in meqtl studies is to control the false_discovery fdr of all significantly associated cpgsnp pairs at e g this means that of all significantly associated cpgsnp pairs are expected to be false_positive owing to the extensive linkage_disequilibrium ld in the human_genome individual cpgs will frequently be associated with many snps hence a particular cpg will often occur many to whom correspondence should be addressed times in the list of significant cpgsnp pairs in practice this is redundant information because ld_structure renders it impossible to pinpoint the causal snp responsible for the variation in dna_methylation using statistical means cf gwas hence the results reported on and further analyses generally focus on the cpgs in the list of significant cpg snp associations i e all cpgs that significantly associate with at least one snp e g we will refer to this approach as the cpgsnp pair based_approach a large proportion of cpgs among the fdr significant cpgsnp pairs may be false_positive to obtain a list of cpgs influenced by genetic_variation in cis that is properly controlled for multiple testing we propose to formally test each cpg obtaining a single valid p value per cpg and control the fdr among those pvalues which we will refer to as the cpg based_approach using a new bait and switch simulation scheme we compare the proportion of falsely identified cpgs using the cpgsnp pair based_approach and our proposed cpg based_approach in simulated_data
