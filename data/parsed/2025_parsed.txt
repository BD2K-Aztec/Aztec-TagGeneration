genome_wide functional element detection using pairwise statistical alignment outperforms multiple genome footprinting techniques motivation comparative_genomic sequence_analysis is a powerful approach for identifying putative functional_elements in silico the availability of full genome_sequences from many vertebrate_species has resulted in the development of popular tools for example the phastcons software_package that search large_numbers of genomes to identify_conserved elements while phastcons can analyze many genomes simultaneously it ignores potentially informative insertion_and and relies on a fixed precomputed multiple_sequence results we have developed a new method grapefoot which simultaneously aligns two full genomes and annotates a set of conserved_regions exhibiting reduced rates of insertion deletion and substitution mutations we tested grapefoot using the human and mouse genomes and compared its performance to a set of phastcons predictions hosted on the ucsc_genome our results demonstrate that despite the use of only two genomes grapefoot identified constrained elements at rates comparable with phastcons which analyzed data from vertebrate_genomes this study demonstrates how integrated modelling of substitutions indels and purifying_selection allows a pairwise analysis to exhibit a sensitivity similar to a heuristic analysis of many genomes availability the grapefoot software and set of genome_wide functional element predictions are freely_available to download online atdespite the wealth of currently available dna_sequence the important task of identifying functionally_important biological regions remains difficult one popular_approach is to search for regions that are putative targets of purifying_selection by virtue of being conserved at a variety of evolutionary_distances while mutational cold spots could also explain the existence of conserved elements population_genetics studies refute this hypothesis and conclude that purifying_selection maintains to whom correspondence should be addressed conserved elements in both drosophila and human_genomes there exists a clear need for general methods that identify functional dna in large mammalian and vertebrate_genomes previous genome_wide conservation studies have estimated that of the human_genome is under purifying_selection however protein_coding elements have been estimated to make up only of the genome international human_genome non protein_coding conserved material thus represents a large fraction of all functional dna and specialized techniques such as exon finders cannot identify the majority of the dark_matter present in the human_genome two general techniques have been used for identifying putative functional_regions in the human_genome by searching for regions with reduced rates of mutation an example of an approach focusing solely on substitution data is the phastcons software_package phastcons utilizes a phylogenetic hidden_markov phylo hmm which annotates regions in a given multiple_sequence as conserved and non conserved by modelling conserved_regions with reduced rate of point_mutations the use of an hmm framework allows phastcons to estimate all model_parameters including the length and expected level of conservation directly from the sequence_data theoretical_studies have concluded that comparative_studies may exhibit_increased statistical_power when analyzing datasets with larger numbers of genomes and phastcons has been applied to both a set of and a set of vertebrate_genomes a complementary_approach implemented in the consindel software_package searches a precomputed multiple_sequence for regions with a reduced rate of insertion and deletion indel mutations in this approach the annotated set of ancestral repeats ars is analyzed to determine the distribution of ungapped regions sequences between indel events in neutral regions when the entire_genome is examined long ungapped regions that deviate from this null_distribution were found to be highly_enriched with previously annotated functional_elements both phastcons and consindel have dedicated tracks on the ucsc_genome while these techniques successfully_identify many previously annotated functional_elements both make their predictions based on a paucity of either substitution or indel mutations additionally both techniques make their predictions based on a fixed multiple_sequence while this reduces the computational_complexity of both methods uncertainty or errors in the alignment will impactin order to assess the performance of grapefoot we benchmarked its performance against the phastcons and consindel software_packages we tested the three software_package on five different types of previously annotated elements in the human_genome bullet exons we used the set of exons from the ucsc known genes track which accumulates genes from a variety of sources based on protein data swiss_prot and trembl and mrna data refseq genbank bullet putative transcription regulatory_regions ptrrs these are a set of putative transcriptional regulatory_sequences that have been identified from encode experimental_data the bp regions were identified via data from chromatin immunoprecipitated samples hybridized to highdensity microarray chips chip_chip for sequence specific transcription_factors set specificity was increased by requiring additional experimental_evidence chromatic activation dnaase hypersensitivity and nucleosome depletion bullet predicted regulatory_modules premods a genome_wide set of computationally predicted human transcriptional modules predictions are made by searching for clusters of phylogenetically_conserved and repeating transcription_factor motifs using a motif database consisting of tfs bullet micrornas we used the mirbase database a database of published microrna sequences and annotations bullet ars we used the set of repeats predicted by the repeatmasker program which screens dna_sequences for interspersed repeats and low complexity dna_sequences since ars are presumed to evolve neutrally we benchmark the performance in finding these sequences in order to estimate a false_positive we wanted to compare the proportion of previously annotated elements detected by each of the three methods for a variety of different thresholds to compare the three methods we constructed receiver_operating roc_curves for each method page for each of the different functional element types the y axis of the roc_curve represents the true_positive the percentage of nucleotides within a functional element class that are correctly annotated as conserved true_positives and the x axis represents the false_positive the percentage of nucleotides within ars detected by the method false_positives for the same threshold the curve is constructed by placing and connecting points on the plot for a range of different thresholds for the grapefoot results each point on the roc_curve corresponds to of the sets of contiguous elements described in section both phastcons and consindel predictions assign each predicted contiguous element a score ranging from to when constructing roc_curves for these predictions we used these scores for thresholding each point on the roc_curves can be easily reproduced using the base pair_wise intersection feature on the ucsc_genome after loading in our publicly_available list of conserved element predictions we demonstrate an example of this in the supplementary_material since the threshold value does not appear on either axis the roc_curve allows us to compare method performance for a variety of different sensitivity_specificity regimes displays roc_curves for four classes of functional_elements exons ptrrs mirnas and premods the legend for each plot displays the area under the curve auc a summary_statistic that evaluates the methods performance while taking_into both sensitivity_and higher auc values_correspond to increased predictive_accuracy each roc_curve has been modified to exclude the point which is present by definition in all roc_curves this point corresponds to using a score or probability cutoff of zero in which case each method would annotate each nucleotide in the genome as functional corresponding to both a true_positive and a false_positive of the inclusion of this point on the graph however hinders the ability to compare the roc_curves for the different methods and thus we chose to omit the point from both the graphs and the auc calculations the roc_analysis inshows that grapefoot performs well when compared with both phastcons and consindel for all four types of functional_elements additionally the auc values demonstrate that the quality of predictions varies for the different methods for all methods accuracy was highest when detecting exons followed in decreasing order by mirnas premods and ptrrs this performance ordering was not unexpected given the average length and expected conservation of these functional_elements both theoretical and genome based studies have shown that the ability to detect functional_elements via comparative_genomics improves with longer elements and higher levels of conservation exons have an average length of bp and are in general well conserved among vertebrates while micrornas are significantly_smaller with an average length of bp and exhibit a reduced but similar level of conservation as exons in contrast regulatory_modules are expected to contain large percentages of neutral dna interspersed with regulatory_signals such as transcription_factor which have an average length of bp and can exhibit high degrees of variability thus while all ptrrs were constrained to be bp only a small proportion of these bases e g a ptrr could contain only one transcription_factor may be functional and therefore subject to purifying_selection while all methods performed significantly better when detecting premods another set of putative regulatory_modules these modules were identified by searching for clusters of phylogenetically conserved_motifs and therefore were assured to exhibit at least partial sequence_conservation
