systems_biology mzmatch iso an r tool for the annotation and relative quantification of isotope labelled mass_spectrometry data motivation stable_isotope labelling experiments have recently gained increasing_popularity in metabolomics_studies providing unique insights into the dynamics of metabolic_fluxes beyond the steady_state information gathered by routine mass_spectrometry however most liquid chromatographymass spectrometry data analysis software lacks features that enable automated annotation and relative quantification of labelled metabolite peaks here we describe mzmatchiso a new extension to the metabolomics analysis_pipeline mzmatch r results targeted and untargeted isotope profiling using mzmatch iso provides a convenient visual summary of the quality and quantity of labelling for every metabolite through four types of diagnostic plots that show i the chromatograms of the isotope peaks of each compound in each sample group ii the ratio of mono isotopic and labelled peaks indicating the fraction of labelling iii the average peak_area of mono isotopic and labelled peaks in each sample group and iv the trend in the relative amount of labelling in a predetermined isotopomer to aid further statistical_analyses the values used for generating these plots are also provided as a tab_delimited file we demonstrate the power and versatility of mzmatchiso by analysing a c labelled metabolome dataset from trypanosomal parasites availability mzmatch r and mzmatchiso are available free of charge from http mzmatch sourceforge net and can be used on linux and windows platforms running the latest_version of r contact rainer breitling manchester ac uk isotope labelled lcms data to generate plots and tables that describe the labelling pattern in detail the ability to generate a comprehensive graphical visualization of the output along with the extensible and scriptable nature of the software itself makes mzmatchiso a unique data analysis tool for isotope labelling studies mzmatchiso is an extension to mzmatch an_open toolbox for ms data_processing and visualization features of mzmatchenabled by the r package mzmatch rincluding the new peakml data_exchange format and the data analysis_pipeline were described by mzmatch has been applied to many metabolomics_data analyses and is the underlying platform for software such as ideom currently only lcms data analysis is supported by mzmatchiso however it is possible to process gas chromatographymass spectrometry data analyses using mzmatch r and mzmatchiso with some additional scripting
