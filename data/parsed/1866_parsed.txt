structural_bioinformatics folding race a robust method for predicting changes in protein folding_rates upon point_mutations motivation protein_engineering methods are commonly_employed to decipher the folding mechanism of proteins and enzymes however such experiments are exceedingly time and resource_intensive it would therefore be advantageous to develop a simple computational_tool to predict changes in folding_rates upon mutations such a method should be able to rapidly provide the sequence position and chemical nature to modulate through mutation to effect a particular change in rate this can be of importance in protein_folding function or mechanistic_studies results we have developed a robust knowledge based_methodology to predict the changes in folding_rates upon mutations formulated from amino and acid properties using multiple_linear approach we benchmarked this method against an experimental database of point_mutations from two state proteins mutants were first classified according to secondary_structure accessible_surface and position along the primary sequence three prime amino_acid features eliciting the best relationship with folding_rates change were then shortlisted for each class along with an optimized window length we obtained a self consistent mean absolute error of s and a mean pearson_correlation pcc of jack knife test resulted in a mae of s and a pcc of moreover our method highlights the importance of outlier s detection and studying their implications in the folding mechanism availability_and a web_server folding race has been developed and is available atunderstanding protein_folding mechanisms involves identifying the series of steps taken by a polypeptide_chain at a high structural and temporal_resolution during the folding_process though the temporal aspects are challenging to decipher the sequential and structural_features have been relatively easier to address through protein_engineering methodologies this involves the measurement of both the folding_rates and stability for a series of carefully_designed point_mutations along the entire protein_sequence the effects of point_mutations on rates and stability are then compared to the wild_type to obtain a dimensionless number the phi value u that is generally considered as a proxy for the degree of structure at the transition_state and hence shedding light on the mechanism of folding though site_directed experiments have been successfully_applied to more than different proteins the downside is that measuring the stability and folding_rates for the series of mutants is exceedingly time and resource_intensive an alternative tothis approach would involve the computational_prediction of changes in rates and stability upon point_mutations in this regard predicting the changes in thermodynamic_stability upon point_mutations are already well established through sequence_based features structure based parameters force_field based_approaches and statistical_mechanical methods remarkably despite the structural_complexity of proteins the absolute folding_rates are nowadays easy to predict either from topological structural considerations protein length de protein length combined with the secondary_structure content statistical_mechanical approaches mu oz and and simply even from the primary sequence_information combining statistical and machine_learning however the development of models for predicting the effects of point_mutations on changes in folding_rates is still at an infant stage this is important as the availability of a computational_tool could significantly reduce the time taken in experimental_approaches more relevantly it could serve as a first exploratory step to design mutations of interest that could then be experimentally tested moreover it might aid in synthetic designing of protein mutants with known effect on folding_rate for even therapeutic purposes till_date prediction of protein folding_rate change upon point_mutation fora is the only available web_server for real value prediction of folding_rates upon point_mutations based on a quadratic regression_model the major pitfalls in this approach include the small training_dataset of mutants moderate performance encompassing both two state and multistate proteins less diversity in nature of mutants as well as amino_acid feature dataset in this work we have developed a rigorous knowledge based model for the prediction of folding_rates employing a large database of single site point mutants specifically from two state proteins a triple order classification_scheme together with a multiple linear_regression incorporating three descriptors was able to predict the changes in folding_rates with a mean pearson_correlation pcc of mean absolute error mae of s and prediction_accuracy of after jack knife validation the structural implications of the outlying mutants have been exclusively discussed web_server named folding race has been developed for prediction purpose we present a multiple_linear approach to predict the changes in folding_rates upon point_mutations in two state proteins it involves a combination of rigorous classification of mutations incorporating both structural secondary_structure and asa and sequence_based aspects of proteins and heuristic and knowledge based feature_selection of amino_acid descriptors the model could predict with a correlation_coefficient of an absolute error of s and an accuracy of with the experimental changes in rates after cross_validation and outperforms the only available method fora the symmetric mean absolute percentage error_rates smape for the cross_validation and test datasets is and respectively we have developed a web_server named folding race that incorporates the features discussed the structural implications of outliers have also been discussed we expect this method and server to be of importance to experimentalists in identifying the position and nature of mutations that change the rates to the desired extent that can have both folding mechanistic and functional_implications
