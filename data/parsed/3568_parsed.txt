pinacolada peptide_inhibitor ant colony ad_hoc design algorithm motivation design of proteinprotein_interaction ppi inhibitors is a major_challenge in structural_bioinformatics peptides especially short ones amino_acid are natural candidates for inhibition of proteinprotein_complexes due to several attractive features such as high structural compatibility with the protein binding_site mimicking the surface of one of the proteins small_size and the ability to form strong hotspot binding connections with the protein surface efficient rational peptide design is still a major_challenge in computer_aided drug_design due to the huge space of possible sequences which is exponential in the length of the peptide and the high_flexibility of peptide conformations results in this article we present pinacolada a novel computational_method for the design of pep tide inhibitors for proteinprotein_interactions we employ a version of the ant colony optimization heuristic which is used to explore the exponential space n of length n peptide_sequences in combination with our fast robotics motivated pepcrawler algorithm which explores the conform ational space for each candidate sequence pinacolada is being run in parallel on a dell poweredge ghz computer with cores and gb_memory and takes up to h to design a peptide of amino_acids length availability_and an online server available at http bioinfo d cs tau ac il pinacolada proteinprotein_interactions ppis play_a in many cellular_processes and pathways thus development of small_molecules that affect ppis has become an intensive_research field in structural_bioinformatics and computer_aided drug_design the task is to discover small_molecules that will block a specific ppi without harming the function e g catalytic_activity of the target_proteins some of those desired inhibitors include small_molecule and short peptide_inhibitors an interaction between two proteins usually consists of a large interface without a well characterized binding_pocket peptides could be good starting points for new leads in rational_design of inhibitory drugs by mimicking part of the interacting surface of one of the proteins mochly peptides both natural and non natural have been used to inhibit ppis some experimental_studies have investigated inhibitory peptides as competitive docking partners some studies found inhibitory peptides for various kinds of interactions including membrane_protein interactions proteindna binding signaling_pathways etc these studies have been conducted both in vitro and in vivo many biological studies that try to find potent inhibitory peptides used screening of a random_peptide to explore the potential sequence_space such a method could be potentially improved by exploring a pool of peptides which have already been in silico validated thus significantly decreasing the search_space this emphasizes the need for a rational algorithm to design a pool of in silico validated suggestions thus reducing significantly the search_space of in vitro peptide design a common method to design inhibitory peptides is to extract a short_linear fragment from one of the proteins in a given ppi complex we also use this approach for the derivation of an initial template for our design algorithm another validation for this approach comes from studies showing that the interaction_energy of many key_processes and pathways is dominated by proteinpeptide interactions moreover the binding of intrinsically_disordered is partly or mainly peptide mediated however many trials show that non mutated peptides extracted from the interface do not achieve high enough binding_affinity themselves in some case studies randomly_selected mutations improved the binding_energy of linear derived_peptides in other cases peptides were stapled either to make a cyclic peptide or to ensure that the peptide keeps a helical shape nevertheless evidence suggests that linear derived_peptides are a good target specific starting_point for peptide design in the recent_years there have been major_developments in the related field of proteinpeptide docking promising algorithms for peptide binding_site which play_a in peptide design have been developed these include algorithms for peptide binding_site such as pepsite algorithms for local docking and refinement such as pepcrawler flexpepdock and algorithms for ab_initio peptide docking such as flexpepdock ab_initio galaxydock and pepattract there have also been several developments in knowledge based computational_design of peptides however most of them deal with target specific design such as inhibitors for the well studied pdz sh sh_domains which have simple binding sequence_motifs such as pxxp the notch_signaling mhc_class or t cell epitopes a comprehensive_review byencompasses a lot of the variability in this field in this article we present pinacolada a novel computational_method for inhibitory peptide design given an input proteinprotein_complex our algorithm extracts a suitable initial peptide from one of the proteins with high_affinity to bind to the other then it transforms the initial peptide through a sequence of mutations which are optimized by the ant colony method the goal is to find the highest_affinity inhibitory peptide_sequences for the given ppi we deal with the problem of predicting the peptide conformation and free_energy of the interaction with the receptor_protein by applying the pepcrawler algorithm which is a fast refinement local docking algorithm for peptideprotein interactions we also let the user specify biological constraints for the resulting peptides such constraints may consider solubility hydrophobicity helicality and other more specific constraints the output of the algorithm is a list of suggested peptide_sequences to bind the target and inhibit the interaction a webserver which enables users to apply pinacolada has been set up at http bioinfo d cs tau ac il pinacolada to qualitatively assess our method we compared it to a computational study by smith and kortemme later addressed as sk as well as evaluated its ability to predict the fgdf binding_motif smith and kortemme explored the sequence_space of peptides recognized by pdz_domains they used known complexes from the pdb which included a peptide or protein bound to a pdz_domain then they extracted peptides of length from these complexes sk used the design module of the rosetta backrub method to predict additional length peptide_sequences which bind to the corresponding pdz_domains then sk compared their results with phage_display experiments which yielded a good agreement namely the sequence_profiles of peptides that bind to the same domains looked similar in many cases we run pinacolada on nine out of the pdz_domains from that study those that were received from x_ray due to the random fashion of our pinacoladaalgorithm we ran it five times independently for each peptide we sorted the results of the runs according to their computational energy then we considered the most frequently appearing amino_acid in each position calculated over the peptides with best computational energy we compared it with sks most frequent amino_acids and with the phage_display inwe can see the results of sk pinacolada and the phage_display for the nine peptides we defined a hit if our or sk most frequent amino_acid at a certain position is the same as the most frequent amino_acid in the phage_display inwe present the summery of total hits and also the number of hits per peptide remarkably even for non hits we often got the same most frequent acid as sk in positions out of we got the same amino_acid either hit or non hit as sk validating a good correlation between the two methods pinacolada was further tested whether it could detect peptide binding_motifs which are abundant in proteinpeptide interactions in nature we tested it upon a recent crystal_structure of the ntf like domain of g bp human ras gtpase sh binding_protein which binds to a peptide containing a fgdf phe gly_asp phe motif we started pinacolada without any initial pheromones which means no initial knowledge about the peptide_sequence in order to see if pinacolada would design peptides which include the motif or a part of it indeed we saw that in almost all the results the two phe residues were placed correctly in the high_scoring peptides including the first ranked result in the second position the most common amino_acid in the results was cys which differs from gly only by two atoms in the second ranked result there is glu in the third position according toasp could likely be substituted by glu and usp amphibian and fish proteins contain glu in that position depicts the native complex from the pdb and pinacoladas second result one could see that the aromatic_rings of the phe residues are located very close in the two peptides furthermore in the complex taken from the pdb there are contacts atoms in the peptide which are closer than a to an atom from the receptor out of which are from the two phe residues in the first design of pinacolada there were contacts out of which from the two phe residues and in the second design phe contacts out of contacts moreover the computational energy of the two best ranked designs of pinacolada were and as compared to for the native one and their funnel score were and as compared to for the native one presents the behavior of the energy and funnel scores of a typical run of pinacolada we could see that the energy reaches a minimum at round out of but the average_energy of a round of ants continues to decrease even thereafter this is important because it means that even after achieving the minimum of a certain round the ants are still improving on average and thus the reported list of k top performing ants might still change we could also see that the average funnel score increases gradually as the algorithm this table depicts the most frequently appearing amino_acid in each position calculated over the peptides with best computational energy as well as the most frequent appearing amino_acid in the sk study and in the phage displayproceeds the funnel score of the best ant of a round fluctuates due to the fact that we look for the energy minimum and not necessarily the optimal funnel furthermore we see that the funnel score of the best ant of a round has several local maxima with the highest one at rounds and most of the highest funnel scores of best ants correspond to local_minima in the best ant energy score at the moment we do not have yet in vitro validation of the results obtained by our method however the energy and funnel calculation of pepcrawler were tested on the peptidb dataset this dataset includes numerous examples of protein peptide_complexes from the pdb while not containing many redundancies this served as a validation of the funnel score as a measure of peptide binding prediction the average funnel score of all input complexes was and only complexes had a funnel score lower than the experiments on the peptidb and a decoy benchmark have shown clear correlation between the funnel steepness score and binding_affinity running time we have measured pinacoladas performance on a dell poweredge ghz computer with cores and gb_memory running the ants of each round in parallel while the different rounds run sequentially in our experiments we used ants in each round for up to rounds afterward there is no significant_improvement in the results each round lasts between and min depending on the protein and peptide size and other parameters the whole run could take up to h to design a peptide with length of between and amino_acids the running time could be further reduced by using several multi core computers and increasing the number of ants in each round while decreasing the number of rounds
