gene_function using semantic_similarity clustering and enrichment_analysis in the_malaria motivation functional_genomics data provides a rich source of information that can be used in the annotation of the thousands of genes of unknown function found in most sequenced_genomes however previous gene_function programs are mostly produced for relatively well annotated organisms that often have a large amount of functional_genomics data here we present a novel method for predicting gene function that uses clustering of genes by semantic_similarity a nave_bayes classifier and enrichment_analysis to predict gene function for a genome that is less well annotated but does has a severe effect on human_health that of the_malaria results predictions for the molecular_function biological_process and cellular_component of p falciparum genes were created from eight different datasets with a combined prediction also being produced the high_confidence predictions produced by the combined prediction were compared to those produced by a simple k nearest_neighbour classifier approach and were shown to improve accuracy and coverage finally two case studies are described which investigate two biological_processes in more detail that of translation_initiation and invasion of the host_cell availability predictions produced are available at http www bioinformatics leeds ac uk bio pmrt pagodathe massive improvements in dna_sequencing have led in the past_decade to ever more genomes being sequenced most newly_sequenced contain a large_number whose function cannot be inferred through conventional homology methods such as blast and annotating the function of these genes has been aided in recent_years by the production of large high_throughput datasets these datasets can be based on genomic sequence_data to whom correspondence should be addressed using methods such as gene_fusion and phylogenetic profiles or they can be derived from experimental methods such as yeast_two screens and microarray expression however these datasets are often noisy and incomplete which can often lead to problems of low reliability and limited coverage when the data are used to predict gene function to address these problems several gene_function programs have been produced that combine multiple datasets using machine_learning to create synergistic predictions see the review of mousefunc for examples most of these programs rely on a guilt by association approach where a query proteins function is inferred from annotated proteins with similar biological attributes many different approaches have been taken but they can effectively be split into either supervised or unsupervised_learning methods with a supervised approach a training_dataset is created from which an algorithm learns a set of rules that can then be used to predict the most likely annotation of a gene absent from the training_set alternatively an unsupervised_approach can be taken where the data are separated into multiple clusters then for each cluster a statistical_test is applied to see whether a cluster is overrepresented with a particular annotation functions can be defined using several different databases but the most popular is the gene_ontology go the go database is structured as a directed_acyclic in which the terms form a hierarchy where more specific go terms also inherit the more general terms above them early_attempts at gene_function often overlooked these high levels of similarity between terms but more recently programs have attempted to address this problem particularly by the inclusion of semantic_similarity unfortunately these programs all have drawbacks could only produce predictions for genes that already have an annotation whileboth use a semantic_similarity measure but only with a relatively simple k nearest_neighbour knn classifier approach and only using microarray and proteinprotein_interaction data also these two papers limit themselves to human and saccharomyces cerevisaie both organisms which have relatively well annotated genomes gene_function programs for organisms that are less well annotated but have significant effects on humans such as thecausative agent of the most deadly form of malaria plasmodium_falciparum are few the sparse annotation of such genomes and thus lack of training data makes predicting gene function more challenging therefore in this article we collate a large disparate collection of datasets for p falciparum and present a novel method for gene_function that attempts to address this problem our program contains three steps i clustering genes using a semantic_similarity measure into functional clusters ii calculating the probability that a pair of genes belong to the same functional cluster using a bayes classifier iii using these probabilities we employ an enrichment_analysis algorithm to predict the function of the gene we call this program pagoda protein assignment by gene_ontology data associations to assess our method a leave_one procedure was performed for each go category on all p falciparum genes with a go annotation excluding ieas plasmodium_falciparum genes whose functions can be inferred from annotated orthologous_proteins were also excluded where orthologs were defined by the orthomcl a prediction was defined as a success if the nes score of the annotated function was one of three highest for that specificity level coverage was defined as the proportion of total number of genes for which a prediction could be made at that specificity level accuracy and coverage are shown for classifiers based on each dataset separately and all datasets combined are shown in and given in supplementary tables as expected shows that generally pagoda achieves a greater degree of success with more general clusters partly because there are fewer clusters to classify into but also because more genes are clustered at the more general levels and therefore more data are available to inform the prediction the proteinprotein_interaction data consisting mainly of the yeast_two data of produced poor results and the quality of this dataset has been previously questioned the most accurate methods were the domain and gene conservation methods although the former achieved coverage and latter only the combined method which uses the predictions of all the other methods achieved the highest coverage but not the highest_accuracy this is likely to be due to the ability of the combined method to predict the function of genes for which only sparse_data are available but at the cost of decreased confidence in the prediction the result is that the overall accuracy of the combined method is reduced the three different go classes each letter
