raser reads aligner for snps and editing sites of rna motivation accurate identification of genetic_variants such as single_nucleotide snps or rna_editing from rna_seq is important yet challenging because it necessitates a very low false_positive in read_mapping although many read_aligners are available no single aligner was specifically developed or tested as an effective tool for snp and rna_editing prediction results we present raser an accurate read_aligner with novel mapping schemes and index tree_structure that aims to reduce false_positive mappings due to existence of highly_similar regions we demonstrate that raser shows the best mapping accuracy compared with other popular algorithms and highest sensitivity in identifying multiply mapped_reads as a result raser displays superb efficacy in unbiased mapping of the alternative alleles of snps and in identification of rna_editing high_throughput rna_seq are now indispensable in a wide_range of biological and medical research_areas such as gene_expression gene_regulation and functional studies of genetic_abnormalities as a result accurate read_alignment tools are highly_desirable although many short_read exist detection of single_nucleotide snvs and small_insertions indels harbored in the short rna_seq remains a very challenging_task such applications require very low false_positive in read_mapping to avoid calling spurious variants in the reads in addition different from studies of genetic_variants using wholegenome sequencing_data a challenge specific to rna_seq is to accurately quantify the expression levels of alternative alleles of the variants based on rna_seq for example in studies of allelespecific expression ase of single_nucleotide snps the expression levels of the two alleles of each snp are quantified based on the number of mapped_reads to determine_whether a significant allelic bias i e ase exists a well known issue is the mapping bias that favors reads harboring the reference allele identical to the reference_genome used for read_alignment of heterozygous snps this problem is only partially alleviated if the reference_genome is modified to encompass alternative snp alleles that are known to exist in the specific dataset making expensive wholegenome sequencing a necessity in general read alignment_accuracy remains a fundamental limiting_factor for quantification of ases a similar problem exists in studies of rna_editing recently an increasing number of reports focused on identification of rna_editing using rna_seq reviewed in it isnow well established that read_mapping inaccuracy can lead to many false_positive to increase editing prediction efficacy strategies to combine multiple read_aligners and apply a series of artifact filtering steps were utilized although many short_read are available http en wikipedia org wiki list of sequence_alignment software no single aligner was specifically developed or tested as an effective tool for snp and rna_editing prediction in our previous_studies of ase and rna_editing we developed a read_mapping pipeline that makes use of multiple read_alignment tools and applies stringent requirements on the allowed mismatches of mapped_reads specifically it combines the alignment results of bowtie blat and tophat and applies two types of filters to retain reads that map uniquely with n mismatches and do not mapped to any other genomic_loci with n mismatches n n we showed that this double filtering scheme is effective in reducing potential mapping bias or artifacts related to the presence of alternative sequence_variants or homologous regions in the genome however this pipeline demands long cpu time and large hard drive space due to the usage of multiple read_aligners and stringent mismatch filters here we present raser reads aligner for snps and editing sites of rna that is specifically_designed for applications of rnaseq in studies involving snps rna_editing or other types of snvs since raser is a standalone application processing time and hard drive demand are greatly_reduced compared with our previous read_mapping strategy a distinctive_feature of raser is its interrogation of a large number of mapping positions for each read using a novel tree_structure that reduces ambiguity in mapping repeated subsequences thus increasing mapping accuracy the comprehensive search of many possible mapping positions of each read enables a comparative_analysis of these alignments and elimination of ambiguous results likely due to existence of homologous regions in the genome built upon this strength raser further adopts a novel mismatch filtering scheme named obviously best which aims to maximize mapping rate while maintaining high mapping accuracy using both simulated and actual rna_seq we demonstrate that raser shows the best mapping precision compared with other popular read_mapping algorithms the performance of raser remains high for both short and long_reads which is also robust to mismatches and indels in the reads importantly raser shows superb efficacy in unbiased mapping of the alternative alleles of snps and in identification of rna_editing
