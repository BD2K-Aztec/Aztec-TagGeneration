data_and towards building a disease phenotype knowledge_base extracting disease_manifestation relationship from literature motivation systems approaches to studying phenotypic relationships among diseases are emerging as an active area of research for both novel disease_gene and drug_repurposing currently systematic study of disease phenotypic relationships on a phenome wide scale is limited because large_scale machine understandable diseasephenotype relationship knowledge bases are often unavailable here we present an automatic approach to extract dis easemanifestation d m pairs one specific type of diseasepheno type relationship from the wide body of published biomedical_literature data and methods our method leverages external knowledge and limits the amount of human effort required for the text corpus we used medline sentences citations first we used d m pairs from existing biomedical_ontologies as prior_knowledge to automatically discover d mspecific syntactic patterns we then extracted additional pairs from medline using the learned patterns finally we analysed correlations between disease_manifestations and disease associated genes and drugs to demonstrate the potential of this newly created knowledge_base in disease_gene and drug_repurposing results in total we extracted unique d m pairs with a high_precision of among the extracted pairs have not been captured in existing structured knowledge sources we have shown that disease_manifestations correlate positively with both disease associated genes and drug_treatments conclusions the main contribution of our study is the creation of a large_scale and accurate d m phenotype relationship knowledge_base this unique knowledge_base when combined with existing phenotypic genetic and proteomic_datasets can have profound implications in our deeper_understanding of disease_etiology and in rapid drug_repurposing discerning the genetic_contributions to complex human_diseases is challenging demands new types of data and calls for new avenues for advancing the state of the art in systems approaches to uncovering disease_etiology one recognized limitation of current computational candidate disease gene prediction and drug_repurposing approaches is that the selection of gene or drug_candidates is based on known molecular basis of diseases genes or drugs and is therefore limited in the capacity of identifying novel disease genes or new drug_targets it has been increasingly_recognized that phenotypically related_diseases often reflect overlapping molecular causations therefore the systematic study of phenotypic relationships among human_diseases and integration of disease phenotypic_data with existing genetic and omics_data will allow for the elucidation of disease genetic mechanisms and the development of effective drug_therapies without requiring detailed knowledge of the exact relationships among genes which often are not clearly understood however current systematic study of disease phenotypic relationships on both phenome and genomewide scale is limited owing to the fact that large_scale machineunderstandable disease phenotype knowledge bases are often not available the lack of disease phenotype data to complement genetic and proteomic_datasets has limited scientific progress towards elucidating the origins of human disease for better disease prevention and treatment our ultimate research goal is to build a large_scale and accurate diseasephenotype relationship knowledge_base from published_literature patient electronic_health ehrs biomedical_ontologies and other knowledge sources this diseasephenotype knowledge_base will include relationships such as diseaserisk environmental risk_factors and predisposing diseases diseasedisease comorbidity diseaseorgan diseasemanifestation d m symptom among others in this study we focus on automatically extracting d m pairs from the large amount of published biomedical_literature million citations in medline so_far as far as we know this is the first large_scale effort focusing on automatically extracting diseasephenotype relationship knowledge from published biomedical_literature the unique disease phenotype knowledge_base we create can have profound to whom correspondence should be addressed implications in our deeper_understanding of disease_etiology and in rapid drug_repurposing we presented a large_scale and accurate relationship extraction approach to accurately extract many d m phenotype pairs from medline majority of these extracted pairs are not captured in existing knowledge bases nevertheless our study has several limitations i we used known d m pairs from umls to learn specific syntactic patterns among all d m pairs before synonym expansion and pairs after synonym expansion from umls only pairs appeared in medline sentences one possible reason for this low presence of umls pairs in medline is that most of the umls d m pairs are for rare syndromes such as digeorge_syndrome machado joseph syndrome and marfans syndrome the d m pairs from medline are mainly for common complex_diseases such as cardiovascular_diseases neurologic_diseases rheumatoid_arthritis and diabetes_mellitus using the pairs from umls as prior_knowledge we discovered d mspecific patterns however we do not know for sure whether these patterns associated with rare syndromes also represent typical_patterns that researcher used to describe d m relationships including both rare syndromes and common complex_diseases in biomedical_literature intuitively d mspecific patterns should be disease independent and should also notthe recall we need to manually examine more top_ranked patterns and or complement our approach with nonpattern based_approaches iii currently we filtered extracted noun phrase pairs based on exact matching terms in the disease lexicon we can increase the recall of the extracted pairs by keeping nounphrase pairs as long as they contain any terms from the disease lexicons as substrings for example based on our current approach d m pair reovirus type infectionprimary biliary_cirrhosis is missed because term reovirus type infection is not included in the disease lexicon we can modify our pattern by extracting nounphrase pairs as long as they contain as substrings any terms from the input disease lexicon however the precision will also depend on the performance of the parser in nounphrase boundary detection iv our approach is limited to extraction of d m pairs that cooccur in the same sentences therefore pairs that co occurred in abstracts but not in the same sentences are missed because of the large size of the text corpus million articles so_far we expect that important d m pairs will be reported in sentences v we only performed a primitive correlation study between disease_manifestations and disease associated drugs and genes currently we are applying network based systems approaches in using the extracted d m pairs for drug_repurposing and candidate disease gene_selection we acknowledge that many d m pairs may appear only in other sources such as patient ehrs systematic extraction of diseasephenotype relationships from ehrs phenotyping of ehrs is discussed in and is one of our ongoing projects
