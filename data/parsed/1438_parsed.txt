disvis quantifying and visualizing accessible interaction space of distance restrained biomolecular complexes we present disvis a python_package and command_line to calculate the reduced accessible interaction space of distance restrained binary protein_complexes allowing for direct visualization and quantification of the information content of the distance_restraints the approach is general and can also be used as a knowledge based distance energy term in fft based docking directly during the sampling stage availability_and the source_code with documentation is freely_available from https github com haddocking disvis structural_characterization of protein_complexes is of paramount_importance for a fundamental understanding of cellular_processes and with major applications in rational_drug as the quantity of experimentally_determined complexes is only a fraction of their total predicted number complementary computational_techniques have been developed for predicting the structure of complexes from their components additional low_resolution information in the form of distance_restraints can significantly benefit the modeling with a variety of experimental methods providing such information such as chemical cross_links detected by mass_spectrometry ms and distance measurements from electron_paramagnetic epr and fret when two biomolecules are known to interact and no highresolution model is available the structure of the complex can naively be any one state where the molecules are in contact we define the accessible interaction space of the complex as the set of all these states if a distance restraint is imposed on the complex the accessible interaction space reduces depending on the information content of the restraint the interaction space is further reduced if multiple restraints are included so_far however no computational_method has been reported that quantifies this reduction or allows to visualize this accessible interaction space to aid in this task we have developed disvis a gpu accelerated python software_package and command_line disvis for quantifying and visualizing the accessible interaction space of distancerestrained binary complexes disvis takes as input two atomic_structures and a file with distance_restraints and outputs the sum of complexes complying with a given number of restraints together with a density showing the maximum number of consistent restraints at every position in space this indicates whether all data are consistent and can be combined without violations and allows identification of false_positives quantification of the information content of the restraints and visualization of interesting regions in the interaction space the method is generic and can easily be incorporated into existing fast_fourier fft accelerated docking programs as a distance_dependent energy function allowing the marriage made in heaven of direct sampling and scoring of fft generated docking poses at a small computational_cost
