sequence_analysis bridges a tool for identifying local similarities in long_sequences bridges is a heuristic_search tool that uses short word_matches to rapidly_identify local similarities between sequences it consists of three stages filtering input_sequences identifying local similarities and post_processing local similarities as input sequence_data are released from memory after the filtering stage genome_scale datasets can be efficiently compared in a single run bridges also includes parameters which enable the user to dictate the sensitivity_and of a search availability bridges is implemented in the c programming_language and can be run on all platforms source_code are available at http github com rassis bridges identifying homologous genomic_segments is fundamental to tackling a number of biological_problems including mapping functional_elements predicting protein_structures quantifying molecular evolutionary_dynamics and establishing phylogenetic_relationships homologous segments can be located with high_accuracy by employing the smithwaterman approach a dynamic_programming however because it entails examining every possible alignment the smithwaterman approach is computationally_intensive and timeconsuming rendering its use unrealistic for many large_scale projects in the past quarter century several heuristic tools have been developed to rapidly locate homologous segments rather than traversing sequences base by base such programs limit their focus to regions with short exact word_matches though this means that sensitivity is lower when searching for distantly_related similarities heuristic approaches are orders_of than the smith_waterman approach and have low computational costs associated with them for these reasons such tools have become an invaluable resource for biologists and form the backbone of bioinformatics recently we were faced with the task of identifying pairs of unique paralogous segments in the drosophila_melanogaster genome we encountered a number of obstacles when attempting to use the entire_genome as both a query and database with currently available search tools thus we developed bridges which can to whom correspondence should be addressed perform rapid memory_efficient heuristic searches on genome_scale datasets another asset of bridges is that it is highly_flexible with parameters that enable the user to tailor a search to his or her particular goals bridges is a fast and efficient_search tool for identifying homologous segments between long_sequences in a single run of bridges on a linux machine we were able to compare the entire d melanogaster genome to itself and specifically locate paralogous pairs this took h and used a maximum of gb of memory during the entire run some important parameters used were a masking word size of a searching word size of and a minimum score of while blast took approximately the same amount of time and memory to run it produced shorter similarities including those along the diagonal of the alignment blat with default_parameters ran for over weeks before reaching the upper_limit of gb of memory and crashing thus using either of these programs would have required us to filter and stitch together local similarities or to split up the genome substantially an added strength of bridges lies in its ability to be guided by the user via an array of parameters this flexibility allows the user to control the sensitivity_and of a search for our purposes having a parameter rich program to work with was invaluable in that we were able to specifically locate the types of similarities we were interested in such flexibility can also be problematic if the user does not know what parameter_values will produce the desired output however because bridges produces output rapidly the user is free to experiment with several sets of parameters in fact we found it helpful to examine different types of output to better understand how modification of certain parameters affected our results for example increasing the word size or the minimum score resulted in fewer but stronger similarities thus the ability of the user to experiment with parameters is in itself yet another strong asset to bridges
