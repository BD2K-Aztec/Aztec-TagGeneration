databases_and exportaid database of rna_elements regulating nuclear rna export in mammals motivation regulation of nuclear mrna_export or retention is carried_out by rna_elements but the mechanism is not yet well understood to understand the mrna_export process it is important to collect all the involved rna_elements and their transacting factors results by hand curated literature screening we collected in exportaid database experimentally assessed data about rna_elements regulating nuclear_export or retention of endogenous heter ologous or artificial rnas in mammalian_cells this database could help to understand the rna export language and to study the possible export efficiency alterations owing to mutations or polymorphisms currently exportaid stores and rna_elements respectively increasing and decreasing export efficiency and neutral assessed sequences availability_and freely_accessible without registration at http www introni it exportaid exportaid html database and web_interface are implemented in perl mysql apache and javascript with all_major the major_challenge of the post genomic era is to understand the meaning of the genomic_sequences i e to decipher the languages used by different molecular_processes such as transcription rna and protein_folding rna_splicing rna export microrna regulation and so on unfortunately this research is demanding because each language has a wide set of possible words they are not placed in fixed positions in genes the words of different languages could overlap and many words have more than one meaning because of the cellular_context for example genetic rna_splicing rna_folding and rna export codes can coexist in exons a highly_conserved process among eukaryotes but not yet well understood is the rna export it occurs at the end of transcripts maturation finely regulating their nuclear_export retention or import small_rnas are bound directly by the mobile export receptors that bring rnas through the nuclear_pore whereas mrnas assemble into ribonucleoprotein_particles and recruit their exporter receptors such as tapp and crm via adaptor_proteins like aly ref and sr proteins most of the adaptors are part of the exon_junction ejc which binding non specific sequences near exonic junctions mediates the mrna_export however the ejc role is not completely clear in fact one could wonder if transcripts with many introns are exported in a more efficient manner as owing to splicing they manage to recruit more ejc proteins alternatively more ejc proteins would be needed to carry out the export of long mrnas as also transcripts that do not undergo splicing can be exported this suggests that further cis_acting rna_elements provide for the mrna_export actually by studying mammalian intronless rnas and some viral transcripts mainly in retroviruses new rna export elements have been discovered it emerges that a comprehensive_knowledge of all the rna_sequences involved in nuclear_export and of their trans_acting is crucial for a better understanding of the transcripts nuclear_export process and functions in particular collecting all this information scattered throughout the literature in a unique resource would help to explain the export of transcripts such as intronless genes some long_non lncrnas and viral_genomes that do not undergo splicing or the retention of transcripts that undergo splicing moreover to shed light on this mechanism it would be useful to study the possible export efficiency alterations owing to mutations or polymorphisms by hand curated literature screening we collected in exportaid database experimentally assessed data about rna_elements regulating nuclear_export or retention of endogenous heterologous or artificial rnas in mammalian_cells this specialized resource constitutes a repository including information on functional sequences their genomic location experimental_data and involved export pathways exportaid is freely_accessible at www introni it exportaid exportaid html and currently stores and rna_elements respectively increasing and decreasing export efficiency and neutral assessed sequences to whom correspondence should be addressed for pubmed searches we entered the words rna export export rna element or other similar terms or the name of the known rna export elements including their synonyms we included all papers reporting mammalian viral mutated or artificial rna_elements reported to be functional for the rna export in mammalian_cell for each paper we annotated the reported sequences and related information such as the name of the rna functional_elements lying in the sequences the organism to which the sequences belong and the genomic_coordinates along with the genbank accession_numbers we also extracted the experimental_conditions such as the cell_lines used to test the sequence functionality and the structure of the genetic constructs used in transfections in particular we annotated whether the constructs were produced by joining sequences from different parts of the same genome or from different genomes whether constructs were built by putting together different functional_elements and whether the sequences belonged to known genes as constructs are usually cited in papers by name to be easily recognized we also collected their name or when missing the name of the used vector as in all papers the authors quantified the export efficiency of each rna element by the percentage of relative cytoplasmic accumulation by assessing the rna or the activity level of a reporter_gene we thought it would have been useful to annotate these functionality levels therefore for each paper we scaled them from to and assigned a score ranging from to for each sequence this score describes the functional effect of an rna element in terms of tendency to increase or decrease the nuclear_export efficiency we annotated neutral effect to those sequences for which insertion or deletion in a construct did not alter the export efficiency we assigned a positive or a negative score to the functional_elements that respectively increased or decreased the rna export efficiency the user has to consider that an rna element with score does not confer export efficiency of the construct but only that it has the maximum effect in increasing the export among the sequences assessed in the same paper the same goes for a score of finally to assure the database quality we established guidelines for the literature_review and annotation of records and performed an inter annotator analysis carried_out by post doctoral researchers phd students and a senior researcher
