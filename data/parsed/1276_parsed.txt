gene_expression ddgni dynamic delay gene network_inference from high temporal data using gapped local_alignment motivation inferring_gene is very crucial in decoding various complex mechanisms in biological_systems synthesis of a fully_functional transcriptional_factor protein from dna involves series of reactions leading to a delay in gene_regulation the complexity increases with the dynamic delay induced by other small_molecules involved in gene_regulation and noisy cellular_environment the dynamic delay in gene_regulation is quite evident in high temporal live cell_lineage imaging data although a number of gene network_inference are proposed most of them ignore the associated dynamic time delay results here we propose ddgni dynamic delay gene network_inference a novel gene network_inference algorithm based on the gapped local_alignment of gene_expression the local_alignment can detect short_term gene regulations that are usually overlooked by traditional correlation and mutual_information based_methods ddgni uses gaps to handle the dynamic delay and non uniform sampling_frequency in high temporal data like live_cell data our algorithm is evaluated on synthetic and yeast_cell data and caenorhabditis_elegans live_cell data against other prominent methods the area under the curve of our method is significantly_higher when compared to other methods on all three datasets availability the program datasets and supplementary files are available at http www jjwanglab org ddgni biological_systems involve collaborations at various levels from the atomic interactions to more complex ecosystems network formulation will enable a better understanding of such complex systems in particular the interplay between genes and the networks they constitute are of great interest to many biologists gene_networks can help us to comprehend the cause prognosis and to prioritize drug_targets of various diseases the spatial and temporal_dynamics in gene_expression can reveal regulatory_pathways networks and thereby help us to understand various underlying_mechanisms recent_advances in live_cell imaging_techniques have enabled continuous documentation of cell_divisions and quantitative measurement of gene_expressions for each cell throughout embryogenesis inferring regulatory_networks from such data will help to decode various regulatory mechanisms_involved in tissue_differentiation and embryonic_development reconstruction of gene_regulatory grn accurately from high temporal data is fundamental but still remains a challenge gene regulations are not spontaneous various processes are involved in producing fully_functional and measurable concentrations of transcriptional_factors proteins each process takes time leading to the delay in gene_regulation furthermore cellular mrna and protein concentrations are substantially influenced by noisy cellular_environment and other small_molecules involved in gene_regulation these fluctuations noise can lead to the dynamic increase or decrease in delay during transcriptional_regulation as illustrated in the dynamic delay in gene_regulation is quite evident in high temporal live cell_lineage imaging data quite a number of gene network_inference are proposed however their performance varies on different datasets with respective limitations for instance correlation based_methods perform better in predicting linear relationships whereas information_theoretic mutual_information mi based_methods are better for non linear relationships network_topology is also critical as some methods are more suitable for erdosrenyi random topology and others for standard small_world scale_free most of the methods perform better on steady_state data as compared to temporal data due to the fluctuations in magnitude and the delay in gene_expression current grn_inference methods mainly focus on transcriptional_events however most of them ignore the associated dynamic time delay cross_correlation based_methods can identify to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com delayed correlations nonetheless to find the maximal delayed correlation one needs to compute correlations for all the n possible delays between a regulator and its target where n is the number of time points in the gene_expression data this makes it computationally_expensive for hightemporal data moreover it cannot be applied for identification of non linear relationships on the other hand although the timedelayed mi based_methods can predict non linear relationships yet there is a need to compute mi for all the n possible delays mi assumes long sampling intervals and statistical independence between time points however this assumption is not valid for continuous live_cell data as the expression at time t is dependent on its previous time stamp and it is imperative to consider such dependencies time delay aracne is a three step information_theoretic based method starting with the geneexpression change_point analysis it is followed by network construction and then pruning however being an information_theoretic method it inherits limitations such as statistical independence between time points and long sampling intervals genereg is a regression_based method similar to ordinary_differential odes it uses a linear_model with time delay and regulation coefficient as its parameters this assumes a constant delay between the regulator and its target in reality however the delay is dynamic and is influenced by other small_molecules involved in gene_regulation and noisy cell environment recently dynamic time wrapping dtw based similarity_measures are also used to infer time delay gene_networks dtw measures the similarity between two time series by allowing one of the series query to expanse or compress at each time point rather than point to point comparison such that the similarity is maximized one of the key limitations of dtw is that it is a global measure i e dtw assumes that the two time series overlap on the edges and expanses one of the series to the length of other series to compute their similarity however in reality the gene_expression is dynamic and the regulations are active only for a subset of time this phenomenon is clearly observed in developmental and disease_prognosis networks pathways thus in time series geneexpression analysis it is very important to detect local expression similarities to understand the underlying molecular_dynamics in biological_networks all these limitations of current methods advocates the need of new gene network_inference that are least influenced by the dynamic expression delays and the number of time points here we present a new network inference_method based on the gapped local_alignment of gene_expression gapped local_alignment was originally used to align two nucleotide or protein_sequences and to find the best matched subsequences gaps induced in the alignment signify the insertions_and and alignment score reflects the similarity between the two aligned sequences here we employ gapped local_alignment to infer dynamic delay grn the rationale behind the algorithm is that if a gene x is regulating gene y the expression pattern of the target_gene y is stimulated by the expression pattern of its regulator x i e they share similar expression pattern with varying expression delay a regulatory relationship is often a local phenomenon due to the dynamic nature of gene_regulation e g different co factor binding and c shows the example local expression correlations shaded by identifying such common local patterns between a regulator and its target we can reveal the relationships between them d shows positive regulation between the genes pal and elt in the c lineage of caenorhabditis_elegans it can be observed that the delay is not constant throughout the expression i e d d insertion of gaps in the alignment will incorporate dummy time points that can account for the variability in delay instead of mapping the expression values one to one we stretch the expression values of one gene over other by inserting gaps such that the similarity between the two expression_patterns regulator and its target is maximized a detailed_description of the algorithm is given in the methods section the merit of the current method ddgni is to infer the dynamic time delayed grn conventionally multifactorial dream data is used to evaluate the performance of various grninference methods as the dream data is a steady_state data and does not include any time delay in the gene_expression it is thus rendered incompatible to illustrate the merits of ddgni on this dataset therefore it was considered imperative to simulate data that incorporates time delay in the gene_expressions in order to highlight the application of ddgni in handling dynamic time delay furthermore to draw parallels with the already existing_methods timedelay aracne an information_theoretic method is also evaluated on the same simulated_data the results support the potential of ddgni in inferring time delayed grns section furthermore to demonstrate the applicability on steady_state data ddgni is also evaluated on multifactorial dream data with no time delay against three more prominent network_inference maximal information coefficient mic aracne and genie genenetweaver is used to generate the dream multifactorial data the performance of all four methods is quite comparable as shown in supplementary table s to assess the practical_application of ddgni we used the cellcycle time course data from yeast and real_time embryonic gene_expression data from c elegans as discussed in section and respectively the performance of ddgni is evaluated against tdaracne and dtw the auc values show a substantially increased performance of ddgni as compared to td aracne and dtw although several methods are proposed to infer regulatory_networks from temporal data their performance is not satisfactory especially with the dynamic delay associated to the gene_regulation high_complexity and limitations of the existing_methods in handling varying time delay advocates the need of effective gene network_inference that are least influenced by expression delays and number of time points in this study weproposed a simple and elegant network inference_method based on gapped local_alignment of gene_expression by identifying common local patterns between a regulator and its target we can reveal the regulatory relationship between them in short we span the expression values time points of the target_gene over the expression values of its potential_regulator by inserting gaps such that the similarity between the two expression_patterns is maximized the novelty of our method is the use of gaps to handle the dynamic delay in gene_regulation and uniformly sampled time points which is quite common in long time series such as cell_lineage data the order of multiple regulations can be inferred based on the order of aligned coordinates i e earlier the alignment earlier is its regulation the proposed method is computationally less complex and exercise dynamic_programming we evaluated our performance against prominent network_inference like td aracne dtw mic aracne and genie the auc values for both real_time and simulated time_series evince an improved_performance by our proposed method in handling the dynamic delay during transcriptional_regulation and the evaluation on steady_state deram data suggests the on par performance of ddgni with other prominent methods ddgni is highly suitable for real temporal data with high sampling_frequency where delay dynamics is obvious it is also applicable to short time series data as suggested by its performance on the yeast_cell data in addition to the above its on par performance on static data advocates a more general applicability however as any other pure expression driven method it suffers from spurious relationships i e identified correlations delayed similarity do not represent true causal_relationships this problem can be solved by using chip_seq binding data however in this article only expression data is used for network construction funding
