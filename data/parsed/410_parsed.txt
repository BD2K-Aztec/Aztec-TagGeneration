bioinformatics_discovery antisense_transcription is coupled to nucleosome_occupancy in sense promoters motivation genome_wide pervasive transcription is widespread in eukaryotes revealing an extensive array of antisense_transcription that involves hundreds of previously_unknown non_coding individual cases have shown that antisense_transcription influences sense transcription however genome_wide mechanisms of how anti sense transcription regulates sense transcription remain to be elucidated results here we performed a systematic analysis of senseanti sense transcription and nucleosome_occupancy in yeast we found that antisense_transcription is associated with nucleosome_occupancy in sense promoters using rna_polymerase inactivation data as a reasonable approximation to antisense_transcription inactivation data we further showed that antisense_transcripts increase nucleosome_occupancy in sense promoter_regions they overlap and reduce nu cleosome occupancy in sense promoter_regions around their transcription_termination sites these results reveal the previously_unappreciated roles of antisense_transcription in directing nucleosome_occupancy in sense promoters our findings will have implications in understanding regulatory_functions of antisense_transcription contact pervasive transcription is widespread in eukaryotic_genomes the pervasive transcription gives rise to many non coding nc rnas which are critical for biological_processes such as transcriptional_regulation and genome_stability some ncrnas overlap proteincoding_genes leading to the interleaved organization of transcription among these overlapping ncrnas are a class that are transcribed antisense to the protein_coding sense transcripts experiments on individual genes have shown that antisense_transcripts repress sense transcription through transcriptional interference and inhibitory histone_modifications how antisense_transcripts regulate sense transcription across the genome has so_far however not been elucidated the nucleosome is the basic_unit of eukaryotic chromatin nucleosome_occupancy in promoter_regions is important for regulation of gene_expression a natural question is whether antisense_transcription regulates sense transcription by influencing nucleosome_occupancy in sense promoters in this study we analysed senseantisense transcription and investigated into the mechanisms of how antisense_transcripts regulate sense transcription on a genomic_scale in yeast we found that antisense_transcription causes sense transcripts to show high nucleosome_occupancy in promoter_regions we also found that dynamic_change in nucleosome_occupancy in sense promoters is coupled to change in antisense expression individual cases have shown that antisense_transcription influences sense transcription through transcriptional interference and histone_modifications however genome_wide mechanisms of how antisense_transcription regulates sense transcription remain to be determined here we found that antisense_transcripts are associated with high nucleosome_occupancy in their overlapped sense promoter_regions and low nucleosome_occupancy in sense promoter_regions around their ttss supplementary moreover dynamic antisense expression change is correlated with nucleosome_occupancy change in sense promoters these results reveal the mechanisms of how antisense_transcription regulates sense transcription and also provide new level of understanding the determinants of nucleosome_occupancy in gene_promoters as we used rna_polymerase inactivation data as an approximation to test the influence of antisense_transcription on nucleosome_occupancy it will be very interesting to directly examine how antisense_transcription regulates nucleosome_occupancy in sense promoters by experiments
