genome_analysis piecewise_constant and low_rank approximation for identification of recurrent copy_number motivation the post genome era sees urgent need for more novel approaches to extracting useful information from the huge amount of genetic data the identification of recurrent copy_number cnvs from array_based acgh data can help understand complex_diseases such as cancer most of the previous computational_methods focused on single sample analysis or statistical_testing based on the results of single sample analysis finding recurrent cnvs from multi sample data remains a challenging topic worth further study results we present a general and robust method to identify recurrent cnvs from multi sample acgh profiles we express the raw dataset as a matrix and demonstrate that recurrent cnvs will form a low_rank matrix hence we formulate the problem as a matrix recovering problem where we aim to find a piecewise_constant and low_rank approximation pla to the input matrix we propose a convex formulation for matrix recovery and an efficient algorithm to globally solve the problem we demonstrate the advantages of pla compared with alternative_methods using synthesized datasets and two breast_cancer datasets the experimental_results show that pla can successfully reconstruct the recurrent cnv patterns from raw_data and achieve better performance compared with alternative_methods under a wide_range of scenarios availability_and the matlab_code is available atcopy number variations cnvs are genomic_alterations characterized as abnormal number of copies in one or more segments of dna the size of segments varies from kb to mb studies have indicated that cnvs are associated with human_diseases for instance found that individuals who carried fewer copies of gene ccl l than average were significantly more susceptible to hiv each missing copy increases the susceptibility by several other types of human_diseases such as cancers and autoimmune_diseases have also been linked with cnvs therefore it is important to investigate the contribution of cnv to complex_diseases array_based acgh is a high_throughput and high_resolution approach for measuring changes of copy_numbers in thousands of dna regions in a typical acgh experiment genomic_dnas are extracted from test_samples and reference samples and differentially labeled with two dyes the labeled dnas are mixed together and hybridized to a microarray spotted with dna_probes the ratio between the fluorescence_intensity of the test dna and that of the reference dna at a given probe measures the ratio between the copy_number in the test genome and that in the reference_genome data extracted from an acgh experiment are generally in the form of log ratios a value greater than zero indicates a possible gain in the copy_number while a value less than zero indicates a possible loss detection of cnvs from acgh data is to locate changepoints in log_ratio profiles that partition each chromosome into discrete segments because of the high noise_level in the intensity values of acgh data it is difficult to identify the boundaries of cnvs using the typical thresholding approach many methods have been developed to analyze single sample acgh data including breakpoint detection signal smoothing ben and hidden_markov reviews and comparisons can be found inand willenbrock and fridlyand however finding cnvs from single samples is only the initial step in the search of disease associated genes it has been pointed_out that the recurrent cnvs cnvs at the same genomic_locations appearing frequently over multiple_individuals are more likely to encompass disease critical genes recently an increasing number of methods have become available for finding recurrent cnv regions from acgh data of multiple samples a recurrent cnv region is often defined as a set of consecutive probes that are altered in a group of samples some methods identify recurrent cnv regions via hypothesis_testing by comparing the frequency of alternations at each probe with a null_distribution examples_include these methods rely on the preprocessing to whom correspondence should be addressed of single sample profiles including smoothing segmentation and cnv_calling which may miss some weak but common variations some other methods attempt to detect recurrent cnv regions directly from raw profiles through multiple chain hidden_markov joint segmentation and matrix_factorization methods most of these methods assume a generative_model that describes the characteristics of recurrent variations and fit the model under the assumption of gaussian_noise however these methods rarely consider the influence of individual specific variations which typically have large intensity values and cannot be modeled as gaussian_noise as a result individual specific variations will be mixed with recurrent variations and eventually corrupt the model_fitting in this article we develop a robust and efficient method to identify recurrent cnvs from raw acgh profiles the main contributions are summarized as follows we formulate the problem as a matrix decomposition problem where the raw_data matrix is decomposed into a low_rank component a sparse component and a noise component these three components correspond to recurrent cnvs individual specific variations and random noises respectively the recurrent cnvs can be easily_identified from the low_rank component by thresholding or more sophisticated statistical_analysis the proposed formulation is convex an efficient and scalable algorithm is developed to find the globally optimal_solution based on the state of art convex_optimization techniques the relationship between our model and other related models is explained via simulation of six popular scenarios the rest of this article is organized as follows in section we introduce our model formulation and algorithm in section we report experimental_results finally we conclude our article with some discussions in section in this article we propose a new method to identify recurrent cnvs via recovering a low_rank matrix from raw acgh profiles the proposed method models different scenarios in a single framework with a convex formulation our algorithm guarantees a global optimal_solution we demonstrate the ability of our method to separate recurrent cnvs from other variations in both simulated_data the low_rank matrix output of our method can be used as an input to other recurrent regionfinding algorithms based on permutation_test or other statistical_analyses after the decomposition the individual specific cnvs are mostly included in the sparse component as shown in however the sparse component may also contain noise and measurement_error to precisely detect individualspecific cnvs we may have to apply a postprocessing step to the sparse component another possible approach is to first use existing algorithms e g fused_lasso and tvsp to remove noise in acgh profiles and then apply our model to decompose the processed profiles into recurrent cnvs low_rank and individual specific cnvs sparse
