a convex_optimization approach for identification of human tissue_specific interactomes motivation analysis of organism specific interactomes has yielded novel insights into cellular function and coordination understanding of pathology and identification of markers and drug_targets genes however can exhibit varying levels of cell_type specificity in their expression and their coordinated expression manifests in tissue_specific function and pathology tissue_specific tissue selective interaction mechanisms have significant applications in drug_discovery as they are more likely to reveal drug_targets furthermore tissue_specific transcription_factors tstfs are significantly implicated in human disease including cancers finally disease genes and protein_complexes have the tendency to be differentially_expressed in tissues in which defects cause pathology these observations motivate the construction of refined tissue_specific interactomes from organism specific interactomes results we present a novel technique for constructing human tissue_specific interactomes using a variety of validation tests edge set enrichment_analysis gene_ontology disease gene subnetwork compactness we show that our proposed approach significantly_outperforms state of the art techniques finally using case studies of alzheimers and parkinsons diseases we show that tissue_specific interactomes derived from our study can be used to construct pathways implicated in pathology and demonstrate the use of these pathways in identifying novel targets availability_and proteins are basic workhorses of living_cells their overall quantity is tightly_regulated across different tissues and cell_types to manifest tissue_specific biology and pathobiology these regulatory controls orchestrate cellular_machinery at different levels of resolution including but not limited to gene_regulation epigenetic_modification alternative_splicing and post_translational transcriptional_regulation is a key_component of this hierarchical regulation which has been widely used to study context specific phenotypes in the context of human tissues cell_types genes can exhibit varying levels of specificity in their expression they can be broadly classified as i tissue_specific unique to one cell_type ii tissue selective shared among coherent groups of cell_types and iii housekeeping hk utilized in all cell_types tissue_specific tissue selective genes have significant applications in drug_discovery since they have been shown to be more likely drug_targets tissuespecific transcription_factors tstfs are significantly implicated in human_diseases including cancers finally disease genes and protein_complexes tend to be over expressed in tissues in which defects cause pathology the majority of human proteins does not work in isolation but take part in pathways complexes and other functional_modules tissue_specific proteins are known to follow a similar trend perturbations that impact interacting interfaces of proteins are significantly_enriched among tissue_specific disease_causing this emphasizes the importance of constructing tissue_specific interactomes and their constitutive pathways for understanding mechanisms that v c the author published_by in this article we present a novel method for computing tissuespecific interactomes from organism specific interactomes and expression_profiles of genes in various tissues our method casts the problem as a convex_optimization that diffuses functional activity of genes over the organism specific interactome while simultaneously minimizing perturbation of transcriptional_activity we show using a number of validation_studies that the tissue_specific interactomes computed by our method are superior to those computed using existing_methods finally we show using a case study of brain specific interactome for alzheimers and parkinsons diseases that our method is capable of constructing highly_resolved disease specific pathways providing potential targets for novel drugs
