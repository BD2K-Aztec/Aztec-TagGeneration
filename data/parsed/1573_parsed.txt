empowering biologists with multi omics_data colorectal_cancer as a paradigm motivation recent completion of the global proteomic characterization of the cancer_genome tcga colorectal_cancer crc cohort resulted in the first tumor dataset with complete molecular measurements at dna rna and protein levels using crc as a paradigm we describe the application of the netgestalt framework to provide easy access and interpretation of multi omics_data results the netgestalt crc portal includes genomic epigenomic transcriptomic proteomic and clinical data for the tcga crc cohort data from other crc tumor cohorts and cell_lines and existing knowledge on pathways and networks giving a total of more than million data_points the portal provides features for data query upload visualization and integration these features can be flexibly combined to serve various needs of the users maximizing the synergy among omics_data human visualization and quantitative analysis using three case studies we demonstrate that the portal not only provides user_friendly data query and visualization but also enables efficient data_integration within a single omics_data type across multiple omics_data types and over biological_networks availability_and the netgestalt crc portal can be freely accessed at http www netgestalt org technology advancements have enabled comprehensive characterization of genomic epigenomic transcriptomic proteomic and metabolomic changes in tumor_specimens a prime example is the tcga projects generation of multiple types of omics_data from hundreds of human tumor_specimens for each of the more than selected tumor_types bridging the gap between data generation and investigators ability to retrieve and interpret the data is essential to fully realize the biological and clinical value of the vast amount of omics_data to address this challenge powerful but user_friendly data query systems such as the cbioportal for cancer_genomics have been established moreover the ucsc cancer_genomics browser enables simultaneous visualization of various types of omics_data within the context of genomic_sequence providing an excellent platform for integrating genomeanchored information biological_networks provide_excellent functional contexts for exploring omics_data however node link diagram based network_visualization becomes inadequate as network size and data v c the author published_by the netgestalt crc portal brings together a comprehensive collection of crc related omics_data it not only provides easy query and visualization of the data but also enables efficient data_integration within a single omics_data type across multiple omics_data types and over biological_networks our case studies demonstrate the key features that distinguish netgestalt from other related tools compared with typical network visualization_tools netgestalt allows multi_scale representation and navigation of the data and enables simultaneous visualization of different types of data to facilitate data_integration network_visualization and analysis tools such as cytoscape visant and osprey have already become indispensible tools in systems_biology studies nevertheless node_link do not scale well with increasing network size and data complexity first when the number of nodes goes beyond a few hundreds neither individual nodes and edges nor the modular_structure of the network can be clearly visualized second simultaneous visualization of multiple datasets in a network is inevitably problematic because of a lack of space efforts have been made to collapse all members of a module into a singe meta node extend the two_dimensional representation into three dimension use animation to visualize data from multiple conditions use circlemaps to represent data associated with individual nodes or arrange multiple versions of the same network in a grid despite enormous research_efforts it remains_challenging to use networks as a framework for the visualization and integrative_analysis of large and heterogeneous datasets netgestalt offers one solution to provide a network centric view of multidimensional cancer omics_data although the netgestalt interface shares many similarities with that of the genome_browsers they are conceptually different and complement each other genome_browsers are effective in integrating genome anchored information such as gene structure annotation and copy_number nevertheless they are not designed to reveal functional_relationships among gene_products netgestalt brings functionally_related together to facilitate the interpretation and integration of multi omics_data within the context of biological_networks another unique aspect of netgestalt is the enabling of seamless connections among the data query visualization and integration features which can be used iteratively in different combinations to serve the needs of the users maximizing the synergy among omics_data human visualization and quantitative analysis as a result the portal can be used for both hypothesis_generation and hypothesis_testing or a combination of both moreover users can also upload their own datasets to the system for integrative_analysis the current version of the portal only includes three human proteinprotein_interaction genes not included in the networks are not included for visualization and analysis in the portal in the future we will add functional association networks e g string that do not require physical_interaction in order to further improve gene coverage moreover it has been shown that tissue_specific networks are more functionally_relevant we will consider adding context specific networks to the portal meanwhile users can analyze the datasets using their own networks which can be easily uploaded to the system using crc as a paradigm we have demonstrated the power of netgestalt in facilitating easy access and interpretation of multidimensional cancer omics_data a natural extension is to expand the portal to cover data for other cancer_types analysis across tumor_types as demonstrated by the pan cancer initiative cancer_genome has started to provide novel biological and clinical insights to human cancer a netgestalt pan cancer portal will complement existing efforts within the pan cancer initiative to facilitate the discovery of commonalities differences and emergent_themes across cancer_types at gene pathway and network levels
