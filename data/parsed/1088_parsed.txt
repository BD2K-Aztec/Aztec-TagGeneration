composition of seed_sequence is a major_determinant of microrna targeting patterns motivation micrornas mirnas are small_non that are extensively involved in gene_expression regulation one major roadblock in functional mirna studies is the reliable prediction of genes targeted by mirnas as rules defining mirna target_recognition have not been well established to date availability of high_throughput experimental_data from a recent clash cross_linking ligation and sequencing of hybrids study has presented an unprecedented opportunity to characterize mirna target_recognition patterns which may provide guidance for improved mirna_target results the clash data were analysed to identify distinctive sequence_features that characterize canonical and non canonical mirna_target types most mirna_targets were of non canonical type i e without involving perfect pairing to canonical mirna seed_region different mirnas have distinct targeting patterns and this mirna to mirna variability was associated with seed sequence_composition specifically seed_based canonical target_recognition was dependent on the gc_content of the mirna_seed for mirnas with low gc_content of the seed_region non canonical targeting was the dominant_mechanism for target_recognition in contrast to canonical targeting non canonical targeting did not lead to significant target downregulation at either the rna or proteinmicrornas mirnas are a family of small_non that play important regulatory_roles in many physiological and disease processes about human mirnas have been discovered to date and collectively these mirnas regulate the expression of thousands of genes at both post_transcriptional and translational levels thus identification of gene_targets is critical for functional characterization of mirnas currently most researchers rely on computational_tools to initially identify target candidates for further experimental_validation significant progress has been made in recent_years for the identification of sequence_features relevant to target prediction such as the seed_sequence at the end of the mirna as well as the sequence_context surrounding the seed binding_site of the target transcript however despite the progress current bioinformatics target prediction_tools still have suboptimal performance with both high false_positive one major_obstacle in computational target prediction is the lack of guidance from experimental_observations to address_this multiple high_throughput studies have been performed in recent_years to systematically identify mirna_targets at the transcriptome level for example one major experimental strategy is to identify target_transcripts associated with functional rna_induced risc these methods were able to identify a large number of mirna target_transcripts that were bound to risc by cross_linking immunoprecipitation followed by high_throughput clip_seq in addition proteomics and ribosome studies have been performed to systematically characterize target expression at the translational level more recently clash cross_linking ligation and sequencing of hybrids an improved clip_seq method has been developed to directly identify mirna_target pairs by ligation and sequencing of mirna_target rna_duplexes this new method can simultaneously identify both the mirnas and their cognate binding_sites in the target_transcripts allowing direct characterization of sequence_features relevant to mirna target_recognition with clash thousands of mirna_target pairs were identified interestingly the majority of the target_sites contained no canonical seed pairing site suggesting that other sequence_features of the mirnas played a dominant role in target_recognition in our study we systematically analysed the sequence_composition of the mirnas and paired target_sites from the clash data and identified sequence_features that distinguished canonical from non canonical mirna_targets multiple experimental strategies have been established to identify both mirnas and target_transcripts that are bound to the risc complex however one major_challenge of these strategies is that rna_sequences were identified after pooling mirnas and target_transcripts from all rics complexes together which represents a many to many relationship for mirnas and their targets thus information about specific mirna_target pairs in each risc complex was unknown although multiple computational algorithms were proposed recently for prediction of mirna_target pairs from clip data the most straightforward and reliable way would be to directly identify mirna_target pairs experimentally using the clash method identified thousands of specific mirna_target transcript pairs that were bound to the same risc complexes their work presented an unprecedented opportunity to study mirna target_recognition patterns especially those involving non canonical target_sites most previous mirna_target analyses were focused on target_sites pairing to canonical mirna seed_region the clash data indicate that many targets are not paired to any canonical mirna_seed in fact canonical mirna_targets represented only of all targets in the clash dataset however it was not clear why canonical or non canonical targets were preferentially associated with certain mirnas a major novelty of this work is the identification of sequence determinants for mirna to mirna variability in target_recognition patterns specifically sequence_features related to mirna_seed composition were identified that distinguish canonical mirna targeting from non canonical targeting our previous work on a limited number of mirnas suggested that there is significant mirna to mirna variability associated with target_recognition patterns interestingly reanalysis of the clash data containing a large number of mirnas revealed that composition of the mirna seed_sequence was strongly correlated to targeting patterns for mirnas with weak seed binding stability they recognized target_transcripts mostly through non canonical mechanisms without involving canonical seed pairing thus the current work suggested that variability in seed sequence_composition resulted in variable mirna dependent targeting patterns and this seed variability issue should be taken into consideration when predicting targets for individual mirnas to this end we are currently working on incorporating the seed composition feature into an improved target prediction algorithm for more accurate prediction of suppression of target gene_expression overall non canonical targeting was the norm rather than exception when all mirnas were considered collectively however the functional consequences of mirna targeting were dependent on target_recognition patterns canonical targeting involving perfect pairing to the canonical seed_region generally led to significant_downregulation of target_transcripts in contrast only marginal transcriptional downregulation was observed for non canonical types of targets based on microarray_analysis similarly canonical targeting but not any other targeting type led to significant suppression of target protein expression based on proteomic_analysis thus our target expression analysis agrees with previous observations that mirnas typically suppress target expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels consistent with our analysis previous experimental_studies demonstrated that mirnas with weak seed binding stability had low proficiency on target downregulation which can be explained by our prediction that most targets of these mirnas were of non canonical type whose expression was not effectively impacted by mirna binding the target type dependency for gene_expression regulation raised an interesting question as to what constitutes an effective mirna_target non canonical targets were bound by mirna and this binding could be functionally_important in ways other than direct target downregulation for example non canonical targets may serve as competing endogenous rnas cernas to sequester mirnas from regulating canonical targets if this is the case non canonical targets could behave more like a reservoir of mirna regulators rather than targets of mirna thus it is likely that concurrent interactions between mirnas and canonical non canonical targets are important to maintain the steady_state of gene_expression regulation networks mediated by mirnas
