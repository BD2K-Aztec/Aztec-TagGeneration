genome_analysis mendel gpu haplotyping and genotype_imputation on graphics_processing motivation in modern sequencing studies one can improve the confidence of genotype_calls by phasing haplotypes using information from an external reference_panel of fully typed unrelated_individuals however the computational_demands are so high that they prohibit researchers with limited computational_resources from haplotyping large_scale sequence_data results our graphics_processing based software delivers haplo typing and imputation accuracies comparable to competing programs at a fraction of the computational_cost and peak memory demand availability mendel gpu our opencl software runs on linux platforms and is portable across amd and nvidia gpus users can down load both code and documentation atimputation of untyped genotypes is a critical preliminary in modern genetic_association the intuition behind haplotype_based imputation is that typed markers situated on haplotypes in key individuals can be leveraged probabilistically to impute untyped markers at the same position in other individuals of similar ethnicity if an imputed single_nucleotide snp correlates better to a causal_variant than neighboring typed snps then imputation can improve statistical_power association in haplotyping and imputation computational_demands escalate quadratically as the number of reference haplotypes increases the computational burdens of current datasets are so onerous that most genotyping centers divide their data into small_subsets and process each subset on a different node of a computer cluster for instance impute documentation recommends this strategy genotyping by second generation sequencing is quickly becoming costcompetitive with traditional snp_genotyping unfortunately the massive_amounts of data generated by sequencing will exacerbate problems and stress traditional computing clusters to the breaking point graphics_processing gpus offer one solution to this dilemma gpus have been used in recent_years to solve several high_dimensional problems in computational_biology amenable to fine_grained parallelization in this article we introduce mendel gpu a software application that addresses the practical need to efficiently impute genotypes on large_scale datasets further details on implementation and additional_analyses can be found in the supplementary_information we have described software to meet the challenges of imputation in whole_genome sequencing_data mendel gpu supports the use of dense reference haplotypes and genotype penetrances as reported by variant_calling pipelines as the two examples illustrate mendel gpu enjoys similar accuracies to the most highly_regarded programs available while requiring only a fraction of their time and memory demands the fine_grained parallel algorithms of mendel gpu effectively harness the computational_efficiency and memory bandwidth of hundreds of gpus although beagle appears to have an edge in accuracy in the scenarios tested the speed and memory advantages of mendel gpu outweigh in our opinion its slight losses in accuracy as gpu devices increase in sophistication and we further tune the code of mendel gpu we expect to see greater gains even as things now stand mendel gpu will prove helpful for researchers interested in testing rare_variants coordinated with the kgp our simulations highlight potential gains for study data consisting of a few hundred subjects sequenced at modest coverage for example whole_genome imputation of low pass sequencing_data on study subjects would complete in days on a machine equipped with a single nvidia tesla c gpu the same analysis using impute would require years on a single_cpu machine this difference puts small laboratories back in contention with the sequencing factories enabling small projects will ripple productively through the entire fabric of genomics research
