structural_bioinformatics non local residue residue_contacts in proteins are more conserved than local ones non covalent residueresidue contacts drive the folding of proteins and stabilize them they may be locali e involve residues that are close in sequence or non local it has been suggested that in most proteins local contacts drive protein_folding by providing crucial constraints of the conformational_space thus allowing proteins to fold we compared residues that are involved in local contacts to residues that are involved in non local contacts and found that in most proteins residues in non local contacts are significantly more conserved evo lutionarily than residues in local contacts moreover non local contacts are more structurally_conserved a contact between positions that are distant in sequence is more likely to exist in many structural homologues compared with a contact between positions that are close in sequence these results provide new insights into the mechanisms of protein_folding and may allow for better prediction of critical intra chain contacts the importance of local versus non local contacts is debated the folding of a peptide_chain into a biologically_active d structure is driven primarily by the non covalent interactions between atoms from different amino_acids not all the non covalent interactions in a protein are equally consequential for folding and stabilization of the structure identifying the interactions that drive folding and distinguishing them from non critical interactions is a key to understanding protein_folding a common distinction that is often mentioned in this context is between local_interactions namely those that occur between residues that are adjacent in sequence and non local ones the relative importance of local versus non local_interactions for protein_folding and stability is bitterly debated for years experimental and theoretical_analyses of their respective importance give conflicting_results an earlier study that was based on computer simulation of models of proteins on a two_dimensional lattice concluded that non local_interactions are critical for folding around the same time however other studies relied on theoretical and experimental_results to propose that folding is determined primarily by local_interactions this view was later supported by several studies that suggested that local_interactions dominate folding other studies used statistical_mechanical models to suggest that the importance of non covalent interactions is defined more by their physical nature e g hydrophobic versus electrostatic than by the sequence separation of the participating residues notwithstanding numerous studies have continued to argue that the sequence separation is a relevant feature for distinguishing between more and less important interactions with the growth of protein_structure databases and the advent of computational_methods more sophisticated analyses were applied to larger datasets one computational_analysis determined that the contribution of local_interactions to the stability of the native_state is small while another study concluded that foldability of a sequence is determined primarily by local_interactions in several large_scale analyses the notion of interaction was replaced by that of a contact namely analysing all pairs of residues that are close enough in space to allow for an interaction between them plaxco simons and baker linked the distribution of local and non local contacts to folding_rate they used the relative contact order co which is the average sequence distance between all pairs of contacting residues in a chain higher co indicates more non local contacts while lower co indicates that more of the contacts are local they analysed the co of few dozen single_domain and concluded that proteins with lower co fold more rapidly than ones with higher co a common interpretation of these results is that the ratio of local to non local contacts in a protein determines the kinetics of folding a recent analysis suggested that local and non local contacts have significantly different effect on the folding_rate most of the above studies are based on an attempt to directly_assess the contributions of different interactions to folding based on various energetic models and in some cases on incidental experimental analysis of a small set of proteins the different results may be ascribed at least to some extent to the difference in the models and techniques used in the assessment here we propose to use the wealth of sequence and structure data to tackle this question in a different way rather than attempting to whom correspondence should be addressed y these authors contributed equally to this work the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com to explicitly assess the energetic contribution of each type of intermolecular interaction to the folding and stability of the chain we propose to indirectly assess their importance through their evolutionary and structural conservation we assume that positions that form contacts that are more critical for folding and stability of the proteins are likely to be more conserved this approach_enables large_scale analysis of all known structures and does not require theoretical_models and approximations that may or may not faithfully represent the physical reality of protein_folding we checked whether there are significant differences in evolutionary_conservation between local and non local contacts in the native_structure of proteins we found that in the vast_majority of proteins with known d structure non local contacts are more conserved than local ones furthermore the average conservation of residues that are involved in non local_interactions is significantly_higher than that of proteins involved in local_interactions analysis of the structural_similarity between homologous structures allowed us to assess the structure conservation of individual_residues this was done by checking how often the position of the residue is structurally aligned in structural homologues using a proper background we were able to show that residues that are involved in non local contacts are more likely to be structurally_conserved compared with residues that are involved in local contacts furthermore the non local contacts themselves are more conserved than their local counterparts these differences indicate that residues that are involved in non local contacts are less tolerant to substitutions and structural changes than residues that are involved in local contacts together they offer a new perspective in the discussion about the importance of local and non local contacts to protein_folding and stability conceivably the higher conservation of non local contacts compared with local ones may simply be the result of other already known characteristics of protein_structure for example it is well established that buried residues tend to be more conserved than exposed ones franzosa and xia possibly non local contacts may involve more buried residues while local contacts may occur more frequently between residues that are accessible to solvent if true this may be reflected in the average conservation of each of these groups of contacts however when we calculated the correlation between the accessible_surface of the residues involved in contacts and their entropy we found a rather weak correlation_coefficient of in a more direct analysis we created equal accessibility sets see section such that the local and non local_interactions set have the same distributions of solvent accessibilities in this comparison the difference remained highly_significant though smaller in magnitude p values for entropy see supplementary using relative accessibility gave_similar supplementary another possible source for the difference may be the number of spatial neighbours of each residue residues involved in non local contacts may be involved on average in more contacts than other residues and such hubs may also be more conserved than other residues to control for this possible effect we created an equal accessibilityequal neighbours set see section again non local contacts were significantly more conserved even when we controlled for number of spatial neighbours see supplementary we also checked whether the differences we observed between local and non local contacts may stem from using multi_domain from using the dali structural_alignment algorithm or from bias toward a specific structural_class of proteins although in some cases smaller number of alignments reduced the statistical_significance the trend of greater structural conservation of non local contacts remained_clear in all cases see supplementary tables s s as an illustration we bring the example of non fluorescent flavoprotein pdb nfp highlights in red residues that participate in contacts that are highly structurally_conserved i e high f contacts in this protein the average f contacts of all local contact i e between residues that are positions apart was which is less than a half of the average for non local contacts between residues that were positions apart which was as can be clearly seen in most of the highly_conserved contacts are between residues that are distant in sequence in this case residues apart while only a few may be considered local residues apart it seems that the non local contacts stabilize interactions between helices and within sheets in both categories some of the residues are buried and others are exposed thus using a non redundant version of all proteins with known d structure we showed that non local contacts are on average more conserved both evolutionarily and structurally to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that such differences have been observed and statistically assessed the difference between these two classes of contacts can stem from a variety of structural or evolutionary factors one possible explanation may be that the contribution of non local contacts to the folding or to the stabilization of the native_structure is greater than that of local contacts this claim is consistent with the predictions made based on polymer statistics that a longer polymer_chain is less likely to have contacts between its ends than shorter chains therefore in order to ensure the existence of a non local contact there might be a higher need to conserve the residues providing such a contact this hypothesis is supported by several recent_experimental that found that non local native interactions are being formed in very early_stages of the folding_process they are also consistent with the conjecture that formation of such interactions in the early_stages of folding reduce the configurational entropy of the chain and consequently accelerates folding if true these results may be useful in devising structure prediction_tools and in protein_engineering
