genetics_and learning directed acyclic graphical structures with genetical_genomics motivation large amount of research_efforts have been focused on estimating gene_networks based on gene_expression data to understand the functional basis of a living organism such networks are often obtained by considering pairwise_correlations between genes thus may not reflect the true connectivity between genes by treating gene_expressions as quantitative_traits while considering genetic_markers genetical genomics analysis has shown its power in enhancing the understanding of gene regulations previous_works have shown the improved_performance on estimating the undirected network graphical structure by incorporating genetic_markers as covariates knowing that gene_expressions are often due to directed regulations it is more meaningful to estimate the directed graphical network results in this article we introduce a covariate adjusted gaussian graphical_model to estimate the markov equivalence class of the directed_acyclic dags in a genetical genomics analysis framework we develop a two stage estimation procedure to first estimate the regression_coefficient matrix by penalization the estimated coefficient matrix is then used to estimate the mean values in our multi response gaussian_model to estimate the regulatory_networks of gene_expressions using pc algorithm the estimation consistency for high_dimensional sparse dags is established simulations are conducted to demonstrate our theoretical results the method is applied to a human alzheimers_disease dataset in which differential dags are identified between cases and controls r code for implementing the method can be downloaded at http www stt msu edu cui availability_and r code for implementing the method is freely_available atthe past_decades have witnessed enormous methodology developments in gene network_inference using gene_expression data e g such networks were developed mostly by assessing the pairwise correlation of gene_expressions from a statistical point_of under the assumption that the joint_distribution of the gene_expressions of interest is a multivariate_normal such networks can be constructed by assessing the nonzero elements of the inverse covariance_matrix the so_called precision matrix or concentration matrix assume x x and lin under certain assumptions the positions of zero entries in the precision matrix indicate conditional_independence between variables of study when inferring a network only based on gene_expressions two genes could show correlation in expression simply because they share a common regulator while they should be independent conditioning on the common regulator motivated by this a few methodological_developments have been focused on covariate adjusted graphical_models by using genetic_markers as covariates to correct both false_positives e g in their estimation procedures the effect of genetic_variants is estimated in the first step then the graphical structure is estimated in the second step while adjusting for the genetic effects their simulation_results and real_data analysis showed that graph estimates were substantially improved when taking the genetic effects into account these models are all focused on the estimation of undirected graphs without considering direction information the directed_graphs however are more attractive in the sense that often people are interested in the causal_relationships i e interests are not only focused on whether two variables are conditionally independent but also if one causes the other one in real_life gene_expressions are often the results of directed regulations thus the estimation of directed_graphs should provide more biological_information for further functional investigation genetical_genomics provide optimal resources to learn such directed graphical networks in typical directed_acyclic dag inference one probability_distribution has a set of corresponding dags which are markov equivalent under certain assumptions the directions of the edges in the graphs indicate causal_relations studies on directed_graphs have flourished in the literature both in theory and in application e g the most common case is the gaussian case let y y y p be a p dimensional gaussian random vector and each coordinate represents a gene_expression to infer the regulatory relationship of these p gene_expressions the pc algorithm developed bycan be applied to construct a completed partially dag cpdag the cpdag can uniquely represent all dags corresponding to the common distribution of y and can be represented as the regulatory_networks of the gene_expressions kalisch and b hlmann later proved that the graph obtained from the pcalgorithm is consistent under some conditions even in high_dimensional cases directed_graphs constructed with the pc algorithm are more biologically_relevant compared with undirected graphs however as mentioned before if two genes share a common regulator their expression relationship could be complicated or even distorted without considering the underlying genetic_structure when adjusting for the genotype i e the common regulator effects the two related genes could be independent or vice_versa this motivates us to develop a covariate adjusted directed graphical_model by extending the cpdag estimation procedure to a regression_framework we treat genetic_markers as covariates and develop a two stage estimation method which combines the penalized estimation and pc algorithm to estimate the marker adjusted cpdag structure in the following of the article we first provide some background_knowledge about graphical_models and the formulation of our model and the two stage estimation procedure in section theoretical results are given in section simulations and real_data analysis are given in sections and to justify our method followed by discussions in section all the proofs of the theoretical results are rendered in the supplementary_file due to space limit genes function in networks and gene_expressions often result from gene regulations hence learning directed regulations can enhance simulation setup in the high_dimensional case with varying p q and jour knowledge about gene function and disease_etiology in this work we introduced a covariate adjusted model to study the graphical structures of multiple gene_expressions with direction regulation information we proposed a two stage procedure to obtain the estimated cpdag corresponding to the probability_distribution the marker adjusted expression network can reduce the false connections of two genes if they share a common regulator simulated_data were used to test our method and showed supportive results both in low and high_dimensional cases we provided a consistency result for the case when p is increasing along with sample_size n we applied our method to a real case control dataset to understand the gene regulation_mechanism in alzheimer_disease different graphs were learned corresponding to the case and control_group for the alzheimer pathway analysis we were able to recover some of the structures for genes involved in mitochondria function in the real_data analysis we could not recover the exact causal_relationships between variables that are shown in the kegg_database this is due to the complexity of the biological structure and limited data samples moreover the data may violate the normality assumption other robust_methods such as the nonparanormal model which implement a nonparametric transformation of the data may be applied to our framework in addition we expect more reliable structures can be obtained if we incorporate prior known information into our analysis by pre setting some edges we expect that more accurate and stable estimation can be achieved via incorporating both statistical and biological_knowledge into the model development process these will be incorporated into our future investigation r code for implementing the method can be downloaded at http www stt msu edu cui
