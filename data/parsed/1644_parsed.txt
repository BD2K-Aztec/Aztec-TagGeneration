sequence_analysis eugene maximizing synthetic gene design for heterologous_expression numerous software applications exist to deal with synthetic gene design granting the field of heterologous_expression a significant support however their dispersion requires the access to different tools and online services in order to complete one single project analyzing codon_usage calculating codon adaptation_index cai aligning orthologs and optimizing genes are just a few examples a software application eugene was developed for the optimization of multiple gene synthetic design_algorithms in a seamless automatic form eugene calculates or retrieves genome data on codon_usage relative synonymous_codon and cai codon context cps and codon pair bias gc_content hidden stop_codons repetitions dele terious sites protein primary secondary_and gene orthologs species housekeeping_genes performs alignments and identifies genes and genomes the main function of eugene is analyzing and redesigning gene sequences using multi_objective techniques that maximize the coding features of the resulting sequence availability eugene is freely_available use atmolecular biology has witnessed an increased use of computer science tools especially after the first genome_sequencing assessing the effect and meaning of the genetic_information for cells discovering the information underlying genes and describing protein functionality are some of the most important tasks in this field often these require specialized computing tools moreover the developments in the field of gene decoding and protein_synthesis already show a good knowledge of the factors that are involved in it those factors are mostly related to codon_usage codon context gc_content hidden stop_codons repetitions deleterious sequences messenger_rna mrna secondary_structure and charged transfer_rna availability controlling such factors has become imperative in the field of synthetic gene design therefore numerous tools have been developed to optimize gene sequences and modulate specific characteristics that are believed to influence protein expression efficiency such as optimizer synthetic gene designer and gene composer most of them offer several forms of codon_usage optimization restriction_sites management and removal of codon and nucleotide repetitions however selection or input of additional information is usually required such as codon_usage and context tables or orthologs to perform alignments nonetheless most of the required information is available online in diverse biological_databases such as ncbi ebi pdb and kegg but few systems take advantage of those several other tasks are involved in synthetic gene design efficiency such as calculating protein secondary_structure and visualizing the tertiary_structure to aid in mapping protein motifs to gene zones or gathering and aligning orthologs to find similarities and conservation regions nevertheless despite the amount and variety of available gene information and synthetic redesign approaches integration of those factors into a single optimization tool is still very limited thus in order to advance and facilitate synthetic gene design and analysis we developed a tool that integrates several online services offline tools and synthetic gene redesign techniques into a single application
