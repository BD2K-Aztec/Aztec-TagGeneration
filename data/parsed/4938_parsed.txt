xlmap an r package to visualize and score protein_structure models based on sites of protein cross_linking motivation chemical_cross with mass_spectrometry xl ms provides structural_information for proteins and protein_complexes in the form of crosslinked residue proximity and distance constraints between reactive residues utilizing spatial_information derived from cross_linked residues can therefore assist with structural_modeling of proteins selection of computationally derived model structures of proteins remains_a in structural_biology the comparison of site interactions resulting from xl ms with protein_structure contact_maps can assist the selection of structural_models the prediction of protein_structures is a major_goal of computational_structural accurate prediction of protein_structures remains_a chemical_cross with mass_spectrometry provides residue_level distance constraints dcs that are useful for refining protein structural_models yet few tools exist for integrating cross_linking data with protein_structure to accommodate this lack of tools herein we describe the development of xlmap an algorithm implemented in r to integrate cross_linked sites originating from cross_link mass_spectrometry xl ms data with protein contact_maps a protein structural model can be represented as protein contact_map consisting of a binary two_dimensional matrix of the distance between all possible amino_acid pairs of a three_dimensional protein_structure euclidean_distances between cross_linked residues can be displayed on protein contact_maps the coincidence of cross_linked residues and contact points derived from protein_structures can then be determined and quantified herein as residual scores we define the sum of all residual scores determined in this way as the cmscore and lower cmscores correspond to better agreement between the cross_linked residue map and the structure derived protein contact_map these cmscores can then be used to integrate xl ms experimental_data into the process of selection of optimum predicted structural_models
