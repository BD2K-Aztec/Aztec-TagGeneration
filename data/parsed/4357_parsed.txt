specific small_rna signatures in the amygdala at premotor and motor stages of parkinson's_disease revealed by deep_sequencing analysis motivation most computational_tools for small_non srna sequencing_data analysis focus in micrornas mirnas overlooking other types of srnas that show multi mapping hits here we have developed a pipeline to non redundantly quantify all types of srnas and extract patterns of expression in biologically defined groups we have used our tool to characterize and profile srnas in post_mortem brain samples of control individuals and parkinsons disease pd cases at early premotor and late symptomatic stages results clusters of co expressed srnas mapping onto trnas significantly separated premotor and motor cases from controls a similar result was obtained using a matrix of mirnas slightly varying in sequence isomirs the present framework revealed srna alterations at premotor stages of pd which might reflect initial pathogenic perturbations this tool may be useful to discover srna expression_patterns linked to different biological conditions availability_and the full code is available atrna high_throughput strategies have revealed a plethora of small_non srnas with diverse functions as regulators of gene_expression while micro_rnas mirnas are the best known class of srnas for many others the biogenesis regulation and cellular_roles are largely_unknown accumulating_evidence rna_fragments derived from small_nucleolar snorna and transfer_rna trna are not just random degradation_products but rather stable elements which may have functional activity in physiological_and influencing gene_expression and alternative_splicing sensitize cells to oxidative stress_induced p activation and p dependent cell_death indicating that these srnas may participate in neurodegenerative_processes in the central_nervous cns mirna are essential in cell_type specification and differentiation and post_mitotic longterm neuronal maintenance perturbations of mirna pathways have emerged as effectors of cns damage contributing to impaired cell homeostasis and neuronal_death however the relevance of other types of srnas in analogous processes has been little explored constituting an untapped source of bioactive_compounds several mirnas pathways are altered in neurodegenerative_disorders including parkinsons disease pd the most common movement_disorder we have previously shown that the expression of several mirnas is altered in brains of patients at early premotor and late motor stages of pd these mirnas modulate mitochondrial_function and neuronal viability suggesting a contribution of their deregulation in early pathogenic events in addition mirna_profiling in peripheral_blood suggests specific expression signatures in pd furthermore in leukocytes of pd patients srna deep_sequencing reveals splicing changes that classify brain_region transcriptomes characterization of srna species alteration in pd may provide the basis to understand pathogenesis of pd and to target new non_invasive diagnosis biomarkers however a full characterization of the srna transcriptome in pd including species other than mirnas is still lacking current bioinformatics resources for the analysis of srna sequencing_data are mainly focused in mirna detection and prediction the characterization of other types of srna is not deeply addressed in these tools and only a few of them produce outputs for downstream_analysis a major_drawback in the analysis and quantification of the nonmirna srna is the presence of multi mapping reads that derive from trnas or non coding rna genes with duplication_events on the genome the majority of the current bioinformatic_tools apply inaccurate strategies to handle these types of sequences and i directly discard them resulting in an under estimation of these elements or ii count them everywhere they map causing an overestimation of their expression and making incorrect the use of count_based differential_expression since these methods assume that reads are counted once here we have developed a framework to i characterize the full set of srnas using an improved version of the seqcluster tool that deals with multi mapping reads and ii extract patterns of expression through data_mining analyses we used this framework to quantify all types of srnas from highthroughput sequencing_data of post_mortem brain samples at premotor and motor stages of pd and age_matched subsequent data_mining analyses using the seqcluster output uncovered srna signatures at premotor stages of the disease involving several types of srnas these results suggest that general srna perturbations occur early in pd and further indicate that our pipeline is a sensitive tool to profile all types of srna
