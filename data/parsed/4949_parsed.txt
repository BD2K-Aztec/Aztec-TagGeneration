genetics_and zcall a rare_variant caller for array based genotyping zcall is a variant caller specifically_designed for calling rare single_nucleotide from array based technology this caller is implemented as a post_processing step after a default calling algorithm has been applied the algorithm uses the intensity profile of the common allele homozygote cluster to define the location of the other two genotype clusters we demonstrate improved detection of rare alleles when applying zcall to samples that have both illumina_infinium humanexome beadchip and exome_sequencing available array based genotyping has been a cost_effective method to capture common variation in the population and has led to the discovery of genetic risk_factors for a wide_variety in most instances the significantly associated single_nucleotide snp is not known to be causal but rather likely tags the causal_variants through linkage_disequilibrium in contrast the mapping of mendelian_diseases has been successful at identifying not only the gene of interest but also the specific variant or variants that are likely causal most of the causal alleles for mendelian_diseases have been found in the coding_region of the human_genome i e the exome with recent_developments in sequencing the human_genetics community has aggregated an extensive list of coding_region variants for the purposes of designing array based genotyping_platforms that capture these variants e g the illumina_infinium humanexome beadchip and the affymetrix axiom exome array plate the overwhelming_majority of variation assayed on the exome chip has a minor_allele existing genotype callers were primarily designed for common variation for rare variation however only the common allele homozygote cluster is well populated limiting the efficacy of clustering_algorithms to address this need we developed a new method to accurately call rare variation for array based genotyping called zcall we genotyped samples from a prior swedish schizophrenia association study and hapmap samples on the illumina_infinium humanexome beadchip as described in the supplementary methods we used illuminas gencall algorithm to generate two sets of genotype_calls and illuminas genomestudio software to normalize raw intensities first we used linear_regression r development core team to find the relationship between the means and standard_deviations of the x and y intensities from autosomal common sites using samples with genotype_calls from a sample cluster file and found they were correlated r r p supplementary next we found that z performed well to classify common variation supplementary finally new genotypes were assigned based on thresholds calculated from the linear_regression with z and means and standard_deviations calculated from samples with gencall genotype_calls from a sample cluster file to test how well zcall works for rare variation we compared both gencall and zcall exome chip genotype_calls to whole_exome genotypes in swedish samples supplementary methods to assess rare_variant performance we used the snp wise concordance swc which is calculated by dividing passing sites by the total number of sites a snp is considered passing when the only error is a common homozygote being called a no call for example when considering singletons i e one heterozygote the heterozygote is called correctly as a heterozygote and no common homozygotes are called as heterozygotes for autosomal singleton sites the swc between gencall and whole_exome was and respectively for zcall the main error mode of gencall was calling the singleton heterozygote as a no call while the main error mode of zcall is calling common allele homozygotes as heterozygotes by restricting zcall to missing genotype_calls we observed a swc improvement to supplementary we also tried using genotype_calls from a larger cluster file samples but the performance of zcall was slightly worse even though more singletons were called correctly when using a larger cluster file swc versus more genotype errors were made that cannot be recovered when only calling no calls swc versus therefore zcall performs more effectively using a smaller cluster file we also assessed the effect of sample_size on threshold definition we used three sample_sizes for threshold definition and we found that samples were insufficient to define the thresholds swc but that there was no difference in swc between samples and samples for both to provide an unbiased evaluation we compared gencall and zcall genotype_calls to whole exome_sequencing from samples from the arra autism sequencing consortium for singletons we found the swc using gencall to be and using zcall restricted to no calls to be supplementary we also compared our method with opticall and found for singletons the swc of opticall was versus for zcall supplementary
