flash fast length adjustment of short_reads to improve genome_assemblies motivation next_generation generate very large_numbers of short_reads even with very deep genome_coverage short_read cause problems in de_novo assemblies the use of paired_end libraries with a fragment_size shorter than twice the read_length provides an opportunity to generate much longer_reads by overlapping and merging read_pairs before assembling a genome results we present flash a fast computational_tool to extend the length of short_reads by overlapping paired_end from fragment_libraries that are sufficiently short we tested the correctness of the tool on one million simulated read_pairs and we then applied it as a pre processor for genome_assemblies of illumina_reads from the bacterium staphylococcus_aureus and human_chromosome flash correctly extended and merged reads of the time on simulated reads with an error_rate of with adequately set parameters flash correctly merged reads over of the time even when the reads contained up to errors when flash was used to extend reads prior to assembly the resulting assemblies had substantially greater n lengths for both contigs and scaffolds availability_and the flash system is implemented in c and is freely_available as open source_code atthanks to the rapidly dropping cost of dna_sequencing de_novo whole_genome wgs projects are generating very deep coverage of new genomes however even with the high coverage that is produced by these technologies and despite dramatic_improvements in genome_assembly algorithms the short_read produced by next generation technologies present a significant barrier to reconstructing a genome from wgs_data any increase in read_length will have a significant positive impact on the quality of genome_assemblies several current protocols generate sequences from both ends of a library of dna_fragments if the fragments are shorter than twice the read_length the resulting paired_end will overlap for example a project might use bp libraries with bp reads this type of library presents an opportunity to extend the reads length by to whom correspondence should be addressed overlapping and merging paired_end before using these reads in the assembly in this article we present flash fast length adjustment of short_reads a software_tool to find the correct overlap between paired_end and extend the reads by stitching them together we tested the correctness of the tool on one million simulated bp paired_end and found it to be highly_reliable we then used real_data to measure the effect of this merging procedure on the quality of an assembly we also compared the speed and accuracy of flash to that of shera a related tool that also extends read_length by finding the overlap between paired_end the short_read generated by next_generation are the biggest challenge in assembling genomes into large near complete sequences to tackle this problem we developed flash a highly_accurate very fast tool to merge pairs generated by sequencing both ends of short fragment_libraries flash can be used for any paired_end sequence_data in which the paired_reads overlap including rna_seq as shown in our experiments merging paired_reads with flash can have a significant positive impact on the quality of genome_assemblies
