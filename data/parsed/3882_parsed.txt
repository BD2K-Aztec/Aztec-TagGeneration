rapmap a rapid sensitive and accurate tool for mapping rna_seq to transcriptomes motivation the alignment of sequencing_reads to a transcriptome is a common and important step in many rna_seq analysis tasks when aligning rna_seq directly to a transcriptome as is common in the de_novo setting or when a trusted reference annotation is available care must be taken to report the potentially large number of multi mapping locations per read this can pose a substantial computational_burden for existing aligners and can considerably slow downstream_analysis results we introduce a novel concept quasi mapping and an efficient algorithm implementing this approach for mapping sequencing_reads to a transcriptome by attempting only to report the potential loci of origin of a sequencing read and not the base to base alignment by which it derives from the reference rapmapour tool implementing quasi mappingis capable of mapping sequencing_reads to a target transcriptome substantially faster than existing alignment tools the algorithm we use to implement quasi mapping uses several efficient data_structures and takes_advantage of the special structure of shared sequence prevalent in transcriptomes to rapidly provide highly_accurate mapping information we demonstrate how quasi mapping can be successfully_applied to the problems of transcript_level quantification from rna_seq and the clustering of contigs from de_novo assembled transcriptomes into biologically_meaningful groups availability_and rapmap is implemented in c and is available as open_source under gpl v at https github com combine lab rapmap the bioinformatics community has put tremendous effort into building a wide_array of different tools to solve the read_alignment problem efficiently these tools use many different strategies to quickly find potential alignment locations for reads for example bowtie bowtie bwa and bwa mem use variants of the fm_index while tools like the subread aligner maq and mrsfast use k_mer based indices to help align_reads efficiently because read_alignment is such a ubiquitous task the goal of such tools is often to provide accurate results as quickly as possible indeed recent alignment tools like star demonstrate that rapid alignment of sequenced_reads is possible and tools like hisat demonstrate that this speed can be achieved with only moderate memory_usage when reads are aligned to a collection of reference_sequences that share a substantial amount of sub sequence near or exact repeats a single_read can have many potential alignments and considering all such alignment can be crucial for downstream_analysis e g considering all alignment locations for a read within a transcriptome for the purpose of quantification li and dewey or when attempting to cluster de_novo assembled_contigs by shared multi mapping reads however reporting multiple potential alignments for each read is a difficult_task and tends to substantially slow down even efficient alignment tools yet in many cases all of the information provided by the alignments is not necessary for example in the transcript analysis tasks mentioned above simply the knowledge of the transcripts and positions to which a given read maps well is sufficient to answer the questions being posed in support of such analysis efficient computation we propose a novel concept called quasi mapping and an efficient algorithm implementing quasi mapping exposed in the software_tool rapmap to solve the problem of mapping sequenced_reads to a target transcriptome this algorithm is considerably faster than state of the art aligners and achieves its impressive speed by v c the author published_by
