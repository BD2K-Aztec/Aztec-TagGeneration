sequence_analysis saap rrbs streamlined analysis and annotation_pipeline for reduced_representation reduced_representation rrbs is a cost_effective approach for genome_wide pattern profiling analyzing rrbs sequencing_data is challenging and specialized alignment mapping programs are needed although such programs have been developed a comprehensive solution that provides researchers with good quality and analyzable data is still lacking to address this need we have developed a streamlined analysis and annotation_pipeline for rrbs data saap rrbs that integrates read quality_assessment clean up alignment methylation data_extraction annotation reporting and visualization this package facilitates a rapid transition from sequencing_reads to a fully annotated cpg_methylation report to biological_interpretation availability_and saap rrbs is freely_available to non commercial users at the web_site ndc mayo edu mayo research biostat stand alone packages cfm contact dna_methylation is one of the major epigenetic_control mechanisms for gene_regulation cellular_differentiation embryogenesis x_chromosome genomic_imprinting and tumorigenesis reduced_representation rrbs has been demonstrated to be a cost_effective approach to analyze dna_methylation pattern in cpg dense regions of the genome rrbs data analysis is challenging due to the bisulfitemediated c to t conversion several specific rrbs sequence read_alignment programs have been developed which include bsmap rrbsmap bismark bsseeker and illuminas bisulfite_sequencing software http www illumina com applications epigenetics ilmn each aligner uses a different strategy for bisulfite converted read_mapping bismark and bsseeker to whom correspondence should be addressed convert reference_genome c to t for and g to a for strand and reads c to t for alignment illuminas pipeline does not align to the whole_genome rather digitally digested mspi fragments are generated as multi fasta files which then undergo c t and g a conversion bsmap rrbsmap does not need the reference_genome preparation step but everything is handled internally using bitwise masking in addition to alignment other steps are equally_important to get high_quality and analyzable data for downstream_analyses the mspi digestion bisulfite_treatment and subsequent size_selection tend to generate a higher portion of low quality or adaptercontaminated reads accurate extraction of cpg_methylation status from alignment is not implemented in alignment programs or with limited function and more importantly cpg_methylation is highly context specific in the genome and it would be impossible to interpret the data without annotation herein we present a comprehensive workflow that combines all these steps into a single application that can be run on a high_performance cluster or on an individual workstation the workflow accommodates aligned bam_files from different aligners or conduct annotation alone moreover the workflow can be easily extended to analyze whole_genome
