gene_expression gene_sets net correlations analysis gsnca a multivariate differential_coexpression test for gene_sets motivation to date gene_set approaches primarily focus on identifying differentially_expressed gene_sets pathways methods for identifying differentially_coexpressed pathways also exist but are mostly based on aggregated pairwise_correlations or other pairwise measures of coexpression instead we propose gene_sets net correlations analysis gsnca a multivariate differential_coexpression test that accounts for the complete correlation_structure between genes results in gsnca weight factors are assigned to genes in proportion to the genes cross correlations intergene correlations the problem of finding the weight vectors is formulated as an eigenvector problem with a unique_solution gsnca tests the null_hypothesis that for a gene_set there is no difference in the weight vectors of the genes between two conditions in simulation_studies and the analyses of experimental_data we demonstrate that gsnca captures changes in the structure of genes cross correlations rather than differences in the averaged pairwise_correlations thus gsnca infers differences in coexpression_networks however bypassing method dependent steps of network_inference as an additional result from gsnca we define hub_genes as genes with the largest weights and show that these genes correspond frequently to major and specific pathway regulators as well as to genes that are most affected by the biological difference between two conditions in summary gsnca is a new approach for the analysis of differentially_coexpressed pathways that also evaluates the importance of the genes in the pathways thus providing unique information that may result in the generation of novel biological_hypotheses large_scale biological_research including genetic_linkage association studies copy_number microarray_and expression experiments typically compare two or more different phenotypes to infer a unique genetic_background associated with a particular phenotype a decade_ago the methods for such analyses were dominated by univariate two sample statistical_tests which frequently fell short from a statistical and a biological_perspective because of two reasons first small changes in expression cannot be captured for a single gene using two sample tests e g t statistic with the correction_for second genes do not work in isolation but interact with each other collectively as a consequence statistical_tests need to account for a multivariate nature of expression changes emmert these shortcomings catalyzed the appearance of conceptually new methodologies for the analysis of genomic_data instead of considering a single gene as an expression unit new methodologies started to operate with gene_sets corresponding e g to biological_pathways considering a gene_set as the unit of expression the first test of this kind was the gene_set to date many methodologies for testing the differential_expression of gene_sets molecular_pathways biological_processes have been suggested and are collectively named gene_set gsa approaches gsa approaches can be either competitive or self contained competitive approaches compare a gene_set against its complement that contains all genes except genes in the set and selfcontained approaches compare whether a gene_set is differentially_expressed between two phenotypes unfortunately some competitive gsa approaches are influenced by the genomic coverage and the filtering of the data and can increase their power by the addition of unrelated data and even noise owing to these problems we focus in this article on selfcontained methods only self contained approaches depending on the statistics used for the testing test different null_hypotheses emmert the possibility to formulate different statistical hypotheses enables the formulation and exploration of different biological_hypotheses however for gsa approaches testing hypotheses other than the equality of the mean expression_vectors remains underexplored we recently suggested to extend a univariate_analysis of differential gene variability to a multivariate case of gene_sets with a multivariate non parametric radial kolmogorovsmirnov test sensitive to alternatives that to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work have similar mean vectors but are different in their scale we found that for several tumor_types the pathways detected_exclusively by the radial kolmogorovsmirnov test were mostly tumor specific whereas the pathways with differences in the mean expression_vectors were detected simultaneously in different tumor_types the main focus of this article is to develop a novel multivariate differential_coexpression analysis approach for gene_sets the first approach for testing the differential_coexpression of gene_pairs tested the equality of pairwise_correlations to identify gene_pairs with correlated expression_patterns in one phenotype but not the other its extension to the general multivariate case involving gene_sets with genes depends on the biological_context when there are no a priori defined gene_sets available the simplest way of differential_coexpression analysis implemented in the r package coxpress is to find clusters of coexpressed genes in one condition and check whether these clusters show no correlation in another condition another approach e g implemented in the r package diffcoex constructs adjacency matrices of all genes under different conditions transforms adjacency matrices into a matrix of adjacency differences and uses a topological overlap measure to infer clusters of differentially_coexpressed genes when there are a priori defined gene_sets available the differential_coexpression of gene_sets can be found by using the gene_sets coexpression analysis gsca in this approach the euclidian distance between two correlation vectors constructed from diagonal matrices of pairwise_correlations for different conditions is calculated and the significance of the difference is estimated using permutation_test the differentially_coexpressed gene_sets dcoxs method is similar to gsca in its overall strategy first the genes pairwise coexpressions are characterized separately for two conditions and second the similarities of these characteristics are estimated the dcoxs uses relative entropy matrices in place of correlation matrices as used by gsca and the correlation_coefficient between the upperdiagonal elements of these matrices as a measure of their similarity the new property of dcoxs is that the coexpression of two different pathways can also be estimated there are also other approaches for the differential_coexpression analysis of gene_sets the common aspect of all these approaches is that they account for changes in aggregate measures of pairwise_correlations only in this article we present a novel approach that assesses multivariate changes in the gene coexpression_network between two conditions importantly we do not infer gene coexpression_networks explicitly but instead we estimate net correlation changes by introducing for each gene a weight factor that characterizes its cross correlations in the coexpression_networks weight vectors in both conditions are found as eigenvectors of correlation matrices with zero diagonal elements the gene_sets net correlations analysis gsnca tests the hypothesis that for a gene_set there is no difference in the gene weight vectors between two conditions furthermore we suggest a new graphical visualization to present the full coexpression_network that highlights the most highly_correlated genes using the union of the first and second minimum spanning trees mst we show that genes in the center of mst have large weights and we demonstrate that hub genesgenes with the largest weight in the pathways correspond in real_data frequently to pathway regulators in previous_studies mst was mainly used for cluster_analysis in gene_expression studies for instance suggested gene_expression data clustering based on mst which rigorously converts a multidimensional clustering problem to a tree partitioning problem prompresented a method to improve the biological_relevance in the inference of functional_modules from the gene_expression data by enhancing the structure of a weighted gene coexpression_network using mst however to our knowledge no attempt has been made so_far to present the full coexpression_network that highlights the most highly_correlated genes via mst structure we choose to compare gsnca with the gsca as the idea behind gscacomparing pairwise measures of the genes coexpression between two conditionsis frequently used in other approaches e g dcoxs the conceptual differences between our approach and gsca are illustrated in simulations as well as in the application to two gene_expression data_sets
