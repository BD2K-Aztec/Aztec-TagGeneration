genetics_and ghap an r package for genome_wide haplotyping the ghap r package was designed to call haplotypes from phased marker data given user_defined haplotype_blocks hapblock the package identifies the different haplotype alleles hapallele present in the data and scores sample haplotype allele genotypes hapgenotype based on hapallele dose i e or copies the output is not only useful for analyses that can handle multi allelic markers but is also conveniently formatted for existing pipelines intended for bi_allelic markers availability_and https cran r project org packageghap contact the use of high_density marker panels in genomics relies on the concept of linkage_disequilibrium ld and tagging such that information from unobserved variants can be indirectly captured by correlation with nearby markers methods for genomic analysis are usually based on single markers ignoring that unobserved variants may be better modeled by the use of phase_information moreover the need for tools to perform haplotype calls from phased data has been underserved in spite of the growing interest in haplotype_based analyses in the last years here we describe ghap an r package designed to call haplotypes from phased data the goal of ghap is to compute summary_statistics for haplotype_blocks hapblock and haplotype alleles hapallele as well as to construct a matrix of haplotype genotypes hapgenotype as a general framework each hapallele can be treated as a pseudo marker in downstream_analyses facilitating the incorporation of phase_information in existing pipelines this approach differs from competing_methods as it uses hapallele as markers instead of hidden haplotype states generated by expectation_maximization or hidden_markov the ghap package provides means for haplotype calling facilitating the incorporation of phase_information in genome_wide analyses the package is available at https cran r project org packageghap
