databases_and c it a knowledge database for tissue enriched genes the development of high_throughput such as dna_microarrays and serial_analysis sage has revolutionized profiling of complex transcriptomes enabling researchers to determine the transcription_level of all known unknown or putative genes within one experiment during the last years numerous genome_wide expression studies were performed to analyze the regulation of genes in different developmental_stages diseases or tissues due to the rapidly decreasing costs of nextgeneration_sequencing it is expected that the number of such expression studies will dramatically_increase within the next years differentially_expressed identified by these experiments became a starting_point to characterize putative functions interactions and biological_roles of identified genes recent_studies reveal that the number of genes_encoded in higher organism e g human is not as high as initially expected the current number of protein_coding is predicted to be between and to whom correspondence should be addressed yet a considerable number of putative genes is still not characterized which is in part due to the current mode of data_processing researchers tend to exclude genes with unknown annotations from further analysis even if they show a specific expression_profile suggesting a distinct function in the process under examination assumes that one of the reasons for this bias is caused by the tendency to focus on certain well known signaling_pathways such a focus facilitates further evaluation and manipulation of processes under study because of available knowledge and tools however there is no doubt that characterization of unknown genes is needed to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying biology in a system wide manner c it is a knowledge database focusing on uncharacterized genes to build a starting_point for biologists to study genes with unknown_functions the database implements literature information from the pubmed_database to identify genes that lack publication records based on the assumption that genes are likely to fulfill important functions when their expression is enriched in a certain tissue c it uses the tissue expression information of unigene expressed_sequence est profiles to identify tissue enriched genes since evolutionary_conservation of gene_expression usually indicates important functions of genes in a specific tissue we implemented our algorithm databasedependent gene_selection and analysis dgsa this algorithm identifies tissue enriched genes by using est profiles in all available tissues of organisms that biologists typically use for their research mus_musculus mouse rattus norvegicuis rat gallus_gallus chicken and danio_rerio zebrafish as well as human homo_sapiens c it combines microarray and sage data to give users integrated access to comprehensive transcriptional_profiles furthermore c it is linked with a custom version of the exon array analyzer eaa to allow tissue enriched alternative_splicing analysis despite major attempts to understand the cellular function of genes in the heart a large number of heart enriched genes exist for which no specific function has been assigned to determine the total number of uncharacterized genes the number of protein_coding for each organism based on the ncbi_database we utilized the gene pubmed dataset and found that of the human protein_coding in the ncbi entrez database have no publication in pubmed another recently_published study yielded a slightly_higher number of genes without publication using a similar approach reduction of stringency criteria by three publications per gene increases the proportion of uncharacterized genes to over in other words a significant number of all protein_coding are only poorly_characterized which emphasizes the need to develop new tools for further analysis construction of c it was based on est expression_profiles from the unigene database which were used to identify tissueenriched genes employing our previously_introduced dgsa to all available tissues we included the expression_profiles of human mouse and rat as well as the more distantly_related organisms chicken and zebrafish into c it by utilizing homologene c it displays evolutionary_conserved tissueenriched genes in up to four organisms expression_patterns of genes in functionally_similar tissues are often conserved between different organisms which often indicates that these genes fulfill important_biological in the respective tissues hence the identification of evolutionary_conserved tissue enriched genes serves as an additional filter to exclude false_positive i e nonexpressed genes in addition c it provides the possibility to exclude genes that are expressed in other tissues this feature can be used for example to filter genes that are enriched in two similar tissues literature information from the pubmed_database provided a measure for uncharacterized genes a gene with no or only few published_articles was defined as uncharacterized while we assume that the function of a gene mentioned in many articles is known of course this approach cannot rule out that a gene is mentioned in articles without further investigation or has been studied under a synonym not listed in ncbi however we reason that this approach usually gives a good estimation of a gene at the level of characterization in addition to pubmed we used the medical_subject mesh classification to identify articles related to a specific tissue this approach allows a user to filter for genes that are uncharacterized with respect to the tissue of interest to gain further information on gene_expression largescale transcriptomics studies can be added furthermore precalculated exon array data can be viewed to identify tissue enriched alternative_splicing isoforms using this information it is possible to obtain a comprehensive_overview of the expression_patterns of uncharacterized genes all data mentioned above were integrated into c it for querying by the web_interface seefor allacquired data_sources a simplified overview of the database scheme is shown in
