analyzing taxonomic_classification using extensible markov models_motivation as next_generation is rapidly adding new genomes their correct placement in the taxonomy needs verification however the current methods for confirming classification of a taxon or suggesting revision for a potential misplacement relies on computationally intense multi sequence_alignment followed by an iterative adjustment of the distance_matrix due to intra heterogeneity issues with the s rrna marker no classifier is available for sub genus level which could readily suggest a classification for a novel s rrna sequence metagenomics further complicates the issue by generating fragmented s rrna sequences this article proposes a novel alignment_free method for representing the microbial profiles using extensible markov_models emms with an extended karlinaltschul statistical_framework similar to the classic alignment paradigm we propose a log odds lods score classifier based on gumbel difference distribution that confirms correct classifications with statistical_significance qualifications and suggests revisions where necessary results we tested our method by generating a sub genus level classifier with which we re evaluated classifications of microbial organisms using the ncbi ftp database for the s rrna the results confirm current_classification for all genera while ascertaining significance at furthermore this novel classifier isolates heterogeneity issues to a mere strains while confirming classifications with significance qualification for the remaining the models require less memory than that needed by multi sequence_alignments and have better time complexity than the current methods the classifier operates at sub genus level and thus outperforms the naive_bayes classifier of the rna database project where much of the taxonomic_analysis is available online finally using information redundancy in model_building we show that the method applies to metagenomic fragment classification of escherichia coli_strains availability_and source_code freely_available for download at http lyle smu edu ida emmsa implemented_in and supported on ms windows many different techniques have been proposed for microbial classification most current approaches for classification are based on similarity between the organism to be classified and known correctly_classified organisms this similarity may be based on cell_shape or structure biochemical characteristics g c content nucleic_acid etc more recent techniques have been based on molecular sequence_comparisons presents an excellent review of available tools for microbial classification and emphasizes that currently available tools are not satisfactory he argues for more algorithmic approaches due to the ubiquitous nature of s rrna it is often used as the sequence for comparison sub genus classification is considered a challenge due to lack of resolution if only the s rrna is used use of alternate gene markers and whole genomes have been suggested but s rrna still retains its position as the most commonly used marker in fact we show that only a small percentage of organisms or strains require markers and methods outside of the s rrna a common characteristic of most sequence_based classification_techniques is the requirement for sequence_alignment that is extremely computationally_expensive initial taxonomy evaluations were done with heat maps generated using distance_matrices from multiple_sequence the alignments and tools have been recently improved using rna_secondary and probabilistic_models in however reliance on subjective selection of gene_copies and expensive sequence_alignment may be avoided with alternative_methods this is exactly what we do in this article our approach uses all copies of s and completely avoids alignment while still achieving_high classification_accuracy at the species level statistical signatures created from base_composition frequencies offer an alternative to using classic alignment these alignment_free reduce complexity and processing lempel ziv lz complexity and emm based distance measures look promising for whole_genome phylogenies as the current methods do not scale well however it is desirable to avoid a resource intense all against all distance measurement in a fast_growing taxonomy hidden_markov based profiles offer a solid probabilistic basis and their application is well tailored to dna or protein analyses however the base model needed to be extended for rna the later extensions account for co variability of base_pairs in the rna_sequences due to watsoncrick complementarityin this work we expanded on the alignment_free alternative to using classic alignment_methods and statistics in sequence_analysis with the goal of improving data representation and complementing classification with significance we explored profile models for predicting microbial taxonomy though s rrna is the marker of choice for the majority of microbial classification its heterogeneity due to multiple copies of the gene usually requires a method to select some and discard others based on some criteria our proposed sequence_analysis approach uses all the available sequence copies of s rrna of a microbial organism by reducing similar sequence_regions into fewer nodes in the model in this work we showed that a compact model that includes the complex intra sequence_order can be built using an emm such compact models are called emm signatures and transforming organisms with all their s rrna sequences to emm signatures creates a signature library the library can then be used for homology assessment within each taxa hierarchy to derive member significance four experiments were carried_out to demonstrate the space compression and classification_accuracy down to strain level in all except the lowest classification levels i e species and strain classifications the current classifications and those by our method are in perfect agreement we showed for species level ambiguities that occur due to the heterogenity issues of the s rrna however achieving accuracy with identification of ambiguities that require multi_locus methods is reasonable furthermore same technique applied at strain level i e when diagnostic identification is attempted either identifies a single strain or a small number of strains that share one or more exact copies of the s rrna the rank function output offers feedback for immediate correction in case of taxonomic placement errors which could auto update profile models thus eliminating the need for a distance_matrix based correction future work will address this several approaches for curative analysis of microbial taxonomy based on the s rrna are in existence but all of them either require extensive multi sequence_alignment and or do not use all of the available sequence_information yet new approaches are emerging proposing the use of the whole_genome and or other markers such as reca rpob s rrna etc in order to improve clarity across species we have shown in our article that by using improved statistical signature methods classification significance analysis and homology assessment can be performed effectively with less memory and computation
