deod uncovering dominant effects of cancer_driver based on a partial covariance selection method motivation the generation of a large_volume of cancer_genomes has allowed us to identify disease related alterations more accurately which is expected to enhance our understanding regarding the mechanism of cancer development with genomic_alterations detected one challenge is to pinpoint cancer_driver that cause functional_abnormalities results here we propose a method for uncovering the dominant effects of cancer_driver deod based on a partial covariance selection approach inspired by a convex optimization_technique it estimates the dominant effects of candidate cancer_driver on the expression_level changes of their target_genes it constructs a gene network as a directed weighted graph by integrating dna_copy single_nucleotide and gene_expressions from matched tumor_samples and estimates partial covariances between driver_genes and their target_genes then a scoring_function to measure the cancer driver score for each gene is applied to test the performance of deod a novel scheme is designed for simulating conditional multivariate_normal variables targets and free genes given a group of variables driver_genes when we applied the deod method to both the simulated_data and breast_cancer data deod successfully uncovered driver variables in the simulation_data and identified well known oncogenes in breast_cancer in addition two highly ranked genes by deod were related to survival time the copy_number amplifications of myc q and trps q were closely_related to the survival time with p values and respectively the results demonstrate that deod can efficiently uncover cancer_driver availability_and deod was implemented in matlab and source codes and data are available at http combio gist ac kr softwares by building systematic knowledge about genetic_alterations in cancer we can enhance our understanding concerning the mechanisms of cancer development and so can identify actionable target_genes for cancer treatment genomic_events in cancer are a mixture of driving events that promote cancer development and passenger events that represent random somatic alterations hence it is important to distinguish the two events since effective therapies against cancer should target dominant driver_genes that promote cell_migration into malignant derivatives although many methods based on aberrations in genome_sequences such as copy_number changes or mutations have been proposed to address this challenge limitations still remain for example developed an analytic approach gistic for identifying significantly aberrant regions of genomes that are frequently found in multiple_tumors however the identified aberrant regions were often large and contained many neighborhood genes of cancer_driver by incorporating prior_knowledge several frameworks were designed to represent the potential effects of disease_causing alterations using eight sequencebased and three structure based predictive features a prediction method was developed to estimate the probability of the damaging_effect of a missense_mutation a similar approach was developed to assess the probability that a non_synonymous polymorphism or a single amino_acid affects protein functions a scoring_function measuring the effect of a particular mutation was described to cover activation of neighborhoods in a local pathway however following this method pathway_information was used to define the existence of edges in the network so that interactions in only known pathways were considered in the scoring_function since disease_causing genetic_alterations can be observed from several data types such as copy_numbers gene_expressions or mutations various statistical_approaches to integrate different data types were developed bayesian_network based_methods such as conexic and multi reg recommend the highest scoring candidate driver within the aberrant regions for example in conexic genes in significant copy_number aberrant regions were initially identified as candidate drivers by using the jistic method a modified_version of gistic then for each candidate a bayesian scoring_function was used to measure the influences of the candidate driver on the genes in its module which was constructed by the module networks algorithm in this process relationships between driver_genes and their target_genes were calculated based on the expression levels of the genes hence the effects of copy_number changes of driver_genes on the expression levels of target_genes were not fully incorporated in this study we propose a method for uncovering the dominant effects of cancer_driver deod on their target_genes by incorporating both chromosomal changes and expression changes we first describe a statistical graph estimation model to construct a gene network from an integration of matched copy_number gene_expression and mutation data it is formulated as a convex_optimization which minimizes a least square error under a sparsity constraint to measure the dominant effect of each gene throughout the entire network a scoring_function is proposed to compare the downstream consequences of a genes activity to influences from upstream_regulators we first tested the performance of our method using the simulated_datasets which are generated based on the principle of a conditional multivariate_normal then we applied the proposed method to breast_cancer data from tcga we collected genes from three groups which consist of genes having significant genomic alteration of copy_numbers mutations or expression changes then the method was used to uncover the driver_genes that make a dominant contribution to the union of the three types of alterations based on the estimation of directional interaction behaviors the dominant drivers are correctly pinpointed with the highest_scores of contributions which increase our confidence in the prediction of novel drivers the results demonstrated that our method efficiently uncovers the dominant behaviors of driver_genes under the investigated conditions the main advantages of deod are as follows based on an optimal_combination of copy_number deletions and amplifications with mutation effects deod estimates a large_scale graph by integrating different data types different from other methods deod measures genetic_alterations and directional relationships between genes across different data types copy_number aberration with mutation effects of regulators to expression change of their targets a convex minimization method with a strong theoretical validation of optimality projected gradient was implemented to select incoming edges of each gene as a partial_correlation effect from the other genes in the entire network a partial covariance is then taken into account as a combination of three statistical measurements the partial_correlation from a regulator to its target copy_number changes of the regulator and differential expressions of the target to represent edge scores in the network for each gene the scoring_function measures all effects of the candidate driver gene on the entire network by comparing the accumulation of contributions in downstream cascades to the total direct incoming effect from its upstream we further investigated the effect of mutations on gene_expressions for this task we ran the complete procedure on the breast_cancer data after removing the damaging coefficients of mutations a ij in equation in this modified experiment genes were selected as candidate driver_genes with the threshold score of and the driver scores of several genes with mutations in the multiple samples were significantly_decreased for example the driver score of ush a decreased from to because samples were mutated in this gene with a high_probability of damaging_effects the numbers of samples with mutations in the driver_genes are shown in supplementary table s also genes were removed from the original list of drivers and are listed in supplementary table s when we manually checked the genes in the list from literature in pubmed they were previously known to be related to breast_cancer showing that mutation information is another important source in finding driver_genes similarly we investigated the effect of the ppi_network the binary interactions in the ppi_network were used to describe the expected total incoming effect of each gene in the network in equation genes that have high degrees in the ppi_network would be expected to have more total incoming effects due to the inequality constraint we ran the deod method on breast_cancer without ppi after excluding the ppi_information candidate drivers whose driver scores were less than the threshold score of were removed from the original list of drivers and are listed in supplementary table s a comparison statistic for the incoming effects of genes is given in supplementary table s the incoming effects and degrees of the genes were higher when the ppi_information was included than when the ppi_information was excluded this result shows that integration of the ppi_information in deod successfully incorporated the observation that cancer_genes have a higher degree in the ppi_network our results showed that only some of candidate driver_genes were related to the survival time in both breast_cancer and gbm for example although pten is a well known gbm driver gene and the deletion of pten is one of the hallmarks in gbm development the relationship between the copy_numbers and the survival time was not significant in our study p value and its prognostic_significance still remains_controversial also the statistical_significance of the survival analysis depends on the thresholds for copy_number as shown in supplementary tables s and s for example in breast_cancer the copy_numbers of fbxo were related to the survival time when the threshold was chosen based on of all the copy_numbers p value the number of samples with aberrations while its p value was not significant when was used p value the number of samples with aberrations there might be several complex relationships between genes and the survival time one possible explanation might be the combined effects of a gene and other molecules and another reason might be the chromosomal positions of aberrations or the role of aberrant domains within the gene more analyses are required to reveal the complex relationships between genes and the survival time in this study we explained the activities of genes based on copy_number changes and mutations although other molecules or genetic changes such as micrornas transcription_factors and methylations also play significant roles in cancer development hence the identified driver_genes in this analysis may represent a partial list of those genes that drive changes of cellular_activities in cancer indeed the pcs method can be used to measure relationships between any explanatory_factors and response variables hence it is possible to extend the deod method so that driver_genes can be identified from several different types of molecular changes the extension of the deod method will be our future work to enhance the understanding of cancer development the candidate drivers identified by multi reg and deod were classified into the three molecular_signature gbm subtypes mesenchymal proneural and proliferation
