databases_and integrating human and murine anatomical gene_expression data for improved comparisons motivation information concerning the gene_expression pattern in four dimensions species genes anatomy and developmental_stage is crucial for unraveling the roles of genes through time there are a variety of anatomical gene_expression databases but extracting information from them can be hampered by their diversity and heterogeneity different genes are expressed in various tissues at different developmental_stages knowledge concerning the precise spatial_temporal transcript_abundances of genes during development of an organism in normal as well as in diseased states provides a valuable_tool for understanding_the the susceptibility to complex disease traditionally gene_expression has been measured using dna_microarrays and in situ techniques dna_microarrays allow differential transcript_levels for several genes to be measured at once expression_profiling but information obtained from in situ gene_expression is required for a detailed anatomical and histological snapshot of the identified genes the constant_increase in data and data concerning data metadata both from microarrays and in situ techniques require organization into specialized databases currently a number of diverse databases exist containing information generated using microarray techniques and in situ techniques emage it has become relatively common for databases to provide in situ information for the implementation of new methods that allow such data to become accessible to the user in a spatialtemporal way for example such tools allow a user to select an anatomical_location by interacting with interfaces that present sections of the organism under study at the chosen developmental_stage the combination of a gene_expression data base and a spatialtemporal device to retrieve information has been named a gene_expression atlas atlases for the most relevant model species have been built including zfin for zebrafish bdgp and flybase for drosophila mepd for medaka emage and gxd for mouse and hudsen and arrayexpress atlas for human having well structured gene_expression information relating to model_organisms organized into dedicated databases it is necessary to integrate and make this diverse set of information accessible in a harmonized manner several initiatives have emerged that investigate the possible correlation of global patterns among orthologous_genes from different species some of them including web platforms however problems related to the proper handling of developmental_stage information and anatomy mapping are still pending therefore gene_expression blending from various organisms requires a specific integration effort at three levels orthologous_genes finding developmental_stage mapping and anatomy mapping the first level evolved alongside sequencing initiatives however the requirements for the second and third levels have recently been identified with efforts oriented toward combining data fromthe usefulness of agem is discussed using a specific example related to a well known pathology illustrating in this way the type of analyses that agem provides huntingtons disease hd is a rare neurodegenerative_disorder of the central_nervous characterized by abnormal movements behavioural and psychiatric disturbances and dementia a set of genes related to hd extracted from ingenuity and panther databases have used as input for agemv heatmaps for mouse at ts and human adult have been obtained and analysed by using the option of synchronization where expression information regarding non common human and mouse anatomic_structures has been removed synchronized heatmaps show gene_expression information for a total of common human and mouse structures and genes nosynchronized heatmaps can be found in the supplementary_material each position in the heatmap represents the expression strength of a gene in a specific structure heatmaps are especially valuable in that they allow for an intuitive clustering representation of the variable depicted in them consequently in our heatmaps the clusters page highlight similarities in gene_expression among genes gene_cluster or among structures structure cluster a given structure cluster groups anatomical locations where similar expression_patterns have been shown for the input genes in much the same way a given gene_cluster groups those genes whose expression is comparable in all the studied structures this fact is exemplified in where it canbe seen as an example that casp and casp genes have similar expression_patterns in the studied structures both for human and for mouse as an illustration of anatomical_structure clustering cerebral_cortex and cerebellum belong to the same family in the structure cluster in mouse as well as in human close examination of the synchronized mouse and human heatmaps obtained from the agem platform shows expression in three anatomical_structures belonging to the central_nervous cerebral_cortex cerebellum and hippocampus belonging the two firsts to the same cluster however the pattern of gene_expression observed in the heatmaps is not restricted to central_nervous structures for example expression can be observed in the endocrine system e g pancreas adrenal_gland thyroid placenta exocrine system salivary_gland haemolymphoid system bone_marrow and lymph_node reproductive system ovary uterus testis digestive system stomach small_intestine renal system kidney skeletal_muscle cardiovascular system heart and respiratory system lung while some of these structures have a clear role in some hd associated pathologies weight_loss heart_failure skeletal_muscle pneumonia impaired_glucose and testicular_atrophy others could not be clearly related cross heatmaps provided by agem display the global patterns of tissue_specific expression of orthologous_genes allowing matches or mismatches between patterns in human and mouse to be easily_identified in this case the colors in the heatmap do not denote expression strength but differences in this variable between mouse and human green means same expression for mouse and human blue implies a high expression in mouse than in human and red indicates a high expression in human than in mouse as an illustration hip gene_expression is clearly greater in human than in mouse in all the common structures excepting salivary_gland as it was commented before the structure and gene_clusters summarize the heatmap information by highlighting set of structures or genes with similar expression difference patterns between mouse and human in the example shown differences in the expression of pacsin and cltc genes are well conserved between mouse and human for the studied set of anatomical_structures
