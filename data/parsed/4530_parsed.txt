data_and targeted retrieval of gene_expression using regulatory models_motivation large public_repositories of gene_expression offer the opportunity to position a new experiment into the context of earlier_studies while previous methods rely on experimental annotation or global similarity of expression_profiles across genes or gene_sets we compare experiments by measuring similarity based on an unsupervised data_driven regulatory model around pre specified genes of interest our experiment retrieval approach is novel in two conceptual respects i targetable focus and interpret ability the analysis is targeted at regulatory_relationships of genes that are relevant to the analyst or come from prior_knowledge ii regulatory model based similarity measure related experiments are retrieved based on the strength of inferred regulatory links between genes results we learn a model for the regulation of specific genes from a data repository and exploit it to construct a similarity_metric for an information_retrieval task we use the fisher kernel a rigorous similarity measure that typically has been applied to use generative_models in discriminative classifiers results on human and plant microarray collections indicate that our method is able to substantially_improve the retrieval of related experiments against standard methods furthermore it allows the user to interpret biological conditions in terms of changes in link activity patterns our study of the osmotic_stress network for arabidopsis_thaliana shows that the method successfully identifies relevant relationships around given key_genes availability the code r is available atconsiderable effort has been spent on collecting gene_expression into huge public_repositories this has opened up the door to large_scale comparisons and meta_analysis of data from different experiments a crucial question is how to find datasets that are biologically_relevant for a certain phenomenon under study the common way to obtain relevant data from repositories is keyword_search for instance however the reliability and usefulness of this approach fully depend on the availability and quality of data annotation and on the existence of good standardized keywords therefore content based retrieval methods have received_attention recently in addition to detecting other relevant datasets such methods can assist in automatic prediction of annotations and in discovering previously_unknown relationships between different biological conditions previous data_driven approaches for relating gene_expression can be grouped by two criteria the representation of gene_expression and the similarity measure for comparing profiles regarding the representation there exist three common alternatives i activity profiles over genes often differential rather than absolute_values if control measurements are available or simply rankings of genes ii activity profiles over known gene_sets also called pathways or signatures and iii activity profiles over gene_modules predicted from other data_sources e g proteinprotein_interactions the most widely used similarity_measures are pearson and spearman_correlation other search tools take signatures of up and down regulated_genes as a query and compute rank_based scores against the measurements in a database neither approach is fitted in any way to the database in contrast several approaches derive features from the database or learn a model of it the results are then used when computing the similarity of the query to database entries in the simplest case variances of gene or gene_set activity values are determined from the data compendium and then exploited for calculating a weighted correlation_coefficient beyond that one can apply dimensionality_reduction techniques to learn low_dimensional feature spaces that represent the data appropriately proposed probabilistic generative to whom correspondence should be addressed latent_variable that inherently yield probabilistic similarity_measures between gene_expression in addition to these purely unsupervised methods also supervised approaches have been proposed to relate gene_expression experiments with each other the novelty of our approach lies in the fact that the model learned from the data compendium focuses on inferring the local regulatory_network neighborhood of specific user_defined genes of interest as a well defined and intuitive model based retrieval criterion we use the fisher kernel fk which derives a similarity measure between data_points from a generative_model consequently the comparison of biological_samples is based on the differential activity of particular cellular_processes only the alternative of using global transcriptomic models and hence global similarities between data would easily obscure the interesting local processes shared between measurements the alternative of using known ontologies on the other hand would miss unknown regulatory_patterns in practice the user can focus the modeling by providing known key_genes involved in the biological_process under study or genes whose connection to known pathways and experimental_conditions is yet unclear our model driven targeted retrieval approach is intended to complement earlier tools for experiment retrieval targeted by query genes retrieve experiments where the query genes are differentially_expressed retrieve datasets where the query genes are correlated and greene and troyanskaya identify experimental_conditions discriminating positive_and query genes as our approach models relationships of biological_samples with respect to only a subset of genes it shares some aspects with bicluster detection methods which are very popular in gene_expression analysis defining genes of interest and a query sample can be seen as providing a seed bicluster however in contrast to bicluster approaches we bring the structure of gene_networks into the similarity criterion a related approach has been proposed by but it assumes a given network whereas we infer the network around the target_genes furthermore none of the earlier biclustering type approaches has been designed for retrieval in a nutshell our approach consists of the following components which will be described in detail in section first a regulatory model of gene_expression is learned from the database to allow for more user_interaction and better individual interpretability the model focuses on relationships around user_defined genes of interest here we use a set of local dependency models learned by sparse linear_regression as a simple regulatory model second the model serves as a basis for comparing measurements given a query measurement the method ranks the measurements in the repository according to a model based similarity criterion here a variant of the fk in section we show the effectiveness of our approach in a leukemia case study with a human microarray compendium and in an osmotic_stress study with a collection of plant_stress datasets section discusses the work and describes future extensions we applied our method in two case studies human leukemia and plant_stress we show that targeted expression models are not only able to enhance the retrieval of related measurements but also allow for interpretation of underlying biological_processes in terms of networks and network activation patterns prior_knowledge in the form of key_genes is taken into account and relevant relationships putative network neighbors of the genes are inferred directly from the data we introduced a novel approach for targeted model based retrieval of gene_expression the model we proposed is suitable for efficient retrieval due to the decomposition into gene specific submodels learning can be done offline prior to the queries although we used l regularized_regression to learn a simple regulatory model in this work the approach is not limited to a specific type of probabilistic_models for instance it is straightforward to use the elastic_net approach and it is also possible to exploit additional data e g proteinprotein_interactions or prior_knowledge during learning if the user specified genes are modeled jointly e g by common predictors more computational effort is required at query time alternatively the model may be provided directly by the user in contrast to condition specific regulatory models our method does not rely on annotation of samples the current modeling approach_requires that data are comparable to apply it in cross_platform analysis previous methods to achieve comparability can be used an interesting direction for future work is retrieval across different platforms or species using an integrated model besides allowing for unsupervised data based retrieval of related measurements the proposed method assists in investigating relationships among genes as illustrated in the osmotic_stress example measurements with curated annotation can help to assess the quality of models and to detect condition_dependent activity changes when applying targeted modeling an important question is how to choose the target list for a biological_process of interest if it is too narrow it might not have sufficient discriminative_power if it is too wide the performance might suffer due to irrelevant genes the retrieval framework allows the user to check different possibilities and to interactively improve the target list for her purposes it also makes possible exploration of the types of retrieval results a particular target list yields exploiting different kinds of annotations that are available for the database content this can be useful if the user is interested in specific genes but uncertain about the processes they are involved in finally the targeted modeling and retrieval approach can be a useful analysis tool also for other omics type high_throughput data with respect to the networks in columns represent network links the horizontal line separates osmotic_stress samples from the other samples the vertical lines separate the networks the rd a network is highly activated in osmotic_stress samples the dreb a network is activated in uv b samples and some osmotic_stress samples the at g network is induced by pathogen_infection and treatment with pathogen elicitors annotation of each sample can be found in supplementary
