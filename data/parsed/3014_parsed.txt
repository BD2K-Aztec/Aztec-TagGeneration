mixtures of common t factor analyzers for clustering high_dimensional microarray_data motivation mixtures of factor analyzers enable model_based to be undertaken for high_dimensional microarray_data where the number of observations n is small relative to the number of genes p moreover when the number of clusters is not small for example where there are several different types of cancer there may be the need to reduce further the number of parameters in the specification of the component covariance_matrices a further reduction can be achieved by using mixtures of factor analyzers with common component factor_loadings mcfa which is a more parsimonious model however this approach is sensitive to both non normality and outliers which are commonly observed in microarray_experiments this sensitivity of the mcfa approach is due to its being based on a mixture_model in which the multivariate_normal family of distributions is assumed for the component error and factor distributions results an extension to mixtures of t factor analyzers with common component factor_loadings is considered whereby the multivariate t family is adopted for the component error and factor distributions an em_algorithm is developed for the fitting of mixtures of common t factor analyzers the model can handle data with tails longer than that of the normal distribution is robust against outliers and allows the data to be displayed in low_dimensional plots it is applied here to both synthetic data and some microarray_gene for clustering and shows its better performance over several existing_methods availability the algorithms were implemented in matlab the matlab_code is available at http blog naver com aggie model based_methods have been widely used for both clustering and classifying high_dimensional microarray_data compared various clustering techniques and showed that modelbased method performed well for microarray gene clustering to whom correspondence should be addressed the finite normal mixture_model with unrestricted componentcovariance matrices is a highly parameterized model banfield andintroduced a parameterization of the componentcovariance matrix based on a variant of the standard spectral decomposition and its program mclust has been often used but if the number of genes p is large relative to the sample_size n it may not be possible to use this decomposition to infer an appropriate model for the componentcovariance matrices even if it were possible the results may not be reliable due to potential problems with near singular estimates of the component covariance_matrices when p is large relative to n in this case mixtures of factor analyzers mfa is a useful model to reduce the number of parameters by allowing factor_analytic representation of the component covariance_matrices proposed the mfa adopting a finite_mixture of factor_analysis models which was considered for the purposes of clustering by and applied mfa to tissue_samples with microarray_gene for clustering used mfa to classify microarray_data successfully recently proposed a penalized mfa to allow both selection of effective genes and clustering of high_dimensional simultaneously has proposed another penalized model_based method with unconstrained covariance_matrices in practice for example where there are several different types of cancer there is often the need to reduce further the number of parameters in the specification of the componentcovariance matrices by factor_analytic representations introduced some parsimonious mfa models which include various mfa models with fewer parameters proposed another parsimonious factor mixture_model to allow both dimension_reduction and variable_selection baek and mclachlan andproposed the use of mixtures of factor analyzers with common component factor_loadings mcfa and applied it to a microarray_dataset for clustering the method considerably reduces further the number of parameters and allows the data to be displayed in lowdimensional plots in a straightforward manner in contrast to mfa several analyses of many real_datasets however have suggested that the empirical distribution of gene_expression levels is approximately log normal or sometimes with a slightly heavier tailed t distribution depending on the biological_samples under investigation in particular applied the shapirowilks test to affymetrix microarray_expression and concluded thatpage i where i is a constant e i is the matrix of eigenvectors i is a diagonal matrix with elements proportional to the eigenvalues of i different conditions on i i and e i characterize the volume shape and orientation of each component distribution in mclust we deal with the submodels of mclust eii vii eei vei evi vvi eee eev vev vvv for mfa we assumed the covariance_matrix of errors is equal for each component we took advantage of the mclust software for r and the emmix program for mfa and developed programs for the mcfa and the mctfa approaches using the matlab language the first set concerns both breast and colon_cancer data which consists of gene_expressions for matched tissue pairs of two different cancer_types pairs of breast_tumour and pairs of colon tumour there are genes in the original data butselected genes by filtering uninformative genes it has been reported in many analyses of real_datasets that the empirical distribution of gene_expression levels is approximately log normal or sometimes on the log scale with a slightly heavier tailed t distribution depending on the biological_samples under investigation thus these data may also have many extreme expressions for each gene shows boxplots of the expression levels for the first genes the distribution of each gene is skewed and has a very long tail the rest of the genes also have similar shaped distributions in particular gene has very high expression levels for six particular tissues we implemented the mclust mfa mcfa and mctfa procedures with g components with the number of factors q ranging from to using starting values for the parameters for each value of q we computed the ari and the associated error_rate the results are presented in we have also listed in this table the values of the bic and the approximate weight of evidence awe for each model with different q awe is a model_selection criterion based on an approximation to the classification log_likelihood awe is defined asfor clustering high_dimensional such as microarray gene_expressions mfa is a useful technique since it can reduce the number of parameters through its factor_analytic representation of the component covariance_matrices however this approach isnot provide a sufficient reduction in the number of parameters particularly when the number of clusters subpopulations is not small in this article we proposed a new mixture_model which can reduce the number of parameters further in such instances and cluster the data containing outliers simultaneously by introducing a mixture of t distributions with both component mean and component covariance represented by common factor_loadings we call this approach mixtures of common t factor analyzers mctfa we describe the implementation of an em_algorithm for fitting the mctfa this approach also has the ability to portray the results of a clustering in low dimensional_space we can plot the estimated posterior means of the factorsfactorsfactors j as defined by with the implied cluster labels on the other hand the approaches mclust mfa and mtfa cannot project high_dimensional objects in lowdimensional space the applications of mctfa to two cancer microarray_datasets have demonstrated the usefulness and its relative superiority in clustering performance over mclust mfa and mcfa it has shown that our method works well for clustering data containing outliers moreover it provides information on the distribution structure of each subpopulation by displaying the estimated factor scores in low dimensional_space we observed also that the proposed approach fitted the experimental_datasets better than the other approaches and the performance difference between mctfa and the others becomes even greater when the number of clusters is not small such as in the case of second dataset section of supplementary_material often bic is used to provide a guide to the choice of the number of factors q and the number of components g to be used however it did not always lead to the correct choice of the best model that is bic can lead to too simple or too complex model in practice depending on the problem at hand simulation_studies reported inand mclachlan and peel a show that bic will overrate the number of clusters under misspecification of the component density whereas several alternative criteria such as the awe and icl criterion are able to identify the correct number of clusters even when the component densities are misspecified frhwirth in both of our real_data applications we observed that bic did not choose the best q an apparent explanation for this is that bic tries to choose more complex model since some of the subpopulations of the datasets have skewed distributions and have several extreme outliers on the other hand awe leads to the best or almost the best model with smallest error_rate since it is more robust against misspecification of the component densities for the experimental_datasets recently frhwirth schnatter and pyne reported that awe picked the correct model for both skew t and skew normal mixture distributions also a small simulation_study confirms the better performance of the awe over the bic when the distribution of the data has skewed heavy tails due to some extreme observations section of supplementary_material in future work we wish to investigate the use of various model selection_criteria on choosing the number of factors q and the number of components g in mixtures of t or skewed distributions
