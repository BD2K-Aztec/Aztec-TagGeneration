qcgwas a flexible r package for automated quality_control of genome_wide association results qcgwas is an r package that automates the quality_control of genome_wide association result files its main purpose is to facilitate the quality_control of a large number of such files before meta_analysis alternatively it can be used by individual cohorts to check their own result files qcgwas is flexible and has a wide_range of options allowing rapid generation of high_quality input_files for meta_analysis of genome_wide availability http cran r project org_web qcgwasthe number of consortia aiming to identify genes for complex_traits through meta_analysis of genome_wide gwas has mushroomed in the past_years the advantage of this strategy is that large_sample can be reached allowing detection of genetic_variants with small effects a downside is the lack of unified quality_control qc on the gwas analyses of the individual cohorts as each cohort will typically perform their own analysis according to a standard analysis plan and share only summary_statistics gwas result files are prone to errors due to the vast amount of data they contain and the different manner in which these data are generated by individual cohorts before combining data from individual studies in a metaanalysis it is important to ensure that all data included are valid of high_quality and compatible between cohorts to reduce both the false_positive and the false_negative findings because gwas result files usually contain a standard set of variables it is feasible to automate the qc of these files thereby gaining speed reliability flexibility and the possibility to perform more elaborate checks to our knowledge the only other software_package currently available for qc of gwas result files is gwatoolbox however gwatoolbox does not produce cleaned results files is less flexible regarding file_format and uses a restrictive format for the qc log this makes it less suited for processing and comparing large_numbers of files in preparation of a meta_analysis it also does not check allele information or allow for the retesting of individual qc steps to address these shortcomings we developed qcgwas with the aim to automate qc and allow rapid generation of high_quality input_files for gwas meta_analyses qcgwas is a flexible and comprehensive package for automated qc of gwas result files it can handle a large number of files within reasonable time and is therefore particularly useful for a centralized qc preceding a gwas meta_analysis it can also be used by individual cohorts to inspect the quality of their results currently it is geared toward quantitative_traits but case control results can also be used with proper transformations future versions of the package are under development to accommodate nonsnp variants such as used in sequence_based gwas data
