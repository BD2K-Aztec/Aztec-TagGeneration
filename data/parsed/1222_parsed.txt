data_and customprodb an r package to generate customized protein databases from rna_seq for proteomics search database_search is the most widely used approach for peptide and protein identification in mass_spectrometry based prote omics studies our previous study showed that sample specific protein databases derived from rna_seq can better approximate the real protein pools in the samples and thus improve protein identification more importantly single_nucleotide short insertion and deletions and novel junctions identified from rna_seq make protein database more complete and sample specific here we report an r package customprodb that enables the easy generation of cus tomized databases from rna_seq for proteomics search this work bridges genomics and proteomics_studies and facilitates cross omics data_integration availability_and customprodb and related documents are freely_available atsequence database_search is the primary method for peptide and protein identification in mass_spectrometry based shotgun_proteomics the completeness and specificity of the sequence_databases directly affect the searching results we recently showed that sample specific databases derived from rna_seq can better represent the real protein catalogs in biological_samples and thus improve protein identification in addition sample specific databases allow the identification of variant peptides with the advancements of both shotgun_proteomics and nextgeneration_sequencing ngs_technologies many researchers have started to apply both technologies to the same samples in parallel to gain a multi_dimensional understanding of cellular_systems even for proteomics_studies without corresponding rna_seq it is highly likely to find sequencing_data e g whole_genome exome_sequencing for similar samples here we report an r package customprodb which is dedicated to generate customized database from ngs_data with a focus on rnaseq_data for proteomics search based on the assumption that undetected or lowly_expressed transcripts are less likely to produce detectable proteins the package allows users to filter out proteins with undetected or lowly_expressed transcripts it also allows users to incorporate single_nucleotide short insertion and deletions and novel junctions identified from rna_seq into the protein database illustrates the overall structure of the package methods and functions implemented in the customprodb package are described in detail in a tutorial available as online supplementary_material supplementary_file in section we briefly present the main functionalities of the customprodb package the development of the customprodb package was mainly driven by two demands i to provide a customized protein database from rna_seq for a specific sample and ii to provide a consensus database from a pool of genetically_similar samples therefore we provide two integrated functions to help accomplish these tasks in a single step the value of customized databases for individual samples has already been demonstrated here we provide an example of a consensus database a consensus database was generated based on rna_seq from colon_cancer samples from the cancer_genome tcga previously_published proteomics_data from three colon_cancer patients were searched against the consensus database by including variation and novel junction information in the consensus database we were able to identify variant peptides and novel junction peptides from the proteomics datasets supplementary_file and we did not gain significant improvements in protein identification by applying the transcript_expression threshold possibly because of the high inter patient heterogeneity however compared with the regular refseq database_search more peptide_spectrum were identified using the consensus database this example shows the potential of using a consensus database to capture protein features shared by a cohort of samples the huge amount of genomic and transcriptomic_data available from ngs experiments has enhanced and will continue to enhance shotgun proteomics_studies however it is non trivial for ordinary proteomics researchers to use such data directly the customprodb package fills this gap by providing an efficient tool to generate customized protein databases using expression and variation information available from ngs_data
