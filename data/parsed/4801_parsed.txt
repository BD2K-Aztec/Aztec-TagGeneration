data_and unsupervised discovery of information structure in biomedical documents motivation information structure is analysis is a text_mining technique which classifies text in biomedical articles into categories that capture different types of information such as objectives methods results and conclusions of research it is a highly useful technique that can support a range of biomedical_text tasks and can help readers of biomedical_literature find information of interest faster accelerating the highly time consuming process of literature_review several approaches to is analysis have been presented in the past with promising results in real_world bio medical tasks however all existing_approaches even weakly supervised ones require several hundreds of hand annotated training sentences specific to the domain in question because bio medicine is subject to considerable domain variation such annotations are expensive to obtain this makes the application of is analysis across biomedical domains difficult in this article we investigate an unsupervised_approach to is analysis and evaluate the performance of several un supervised methods on a large corpus of biomedical abstracts collected from pubmed results our best unsupervised algorithm multilevel weighted graph clustering_algorithm performs very well on the task obtaining over f scores for most is categories when applied to well known is schemes this level of performance is close to that of lightly supervised is methods and has proven sufficient to aid a range of practical tasks thus using an unsupervised_approach is could be applied to support a wide_range of tasks across sub domains of biomedicine we also demonstrate that unsupervised_learning brings novel insights into is of biomedical_literature and discovers information categories that are not present in any of the existing is schemes availability_and the annotated corpus and software are available atrecent developments in the areas of natural_language machine_learning and data_mining have led to considerable progress in biomedical_text bio tm producing highly useful techniques that enable users to retrieve and extract information from scientific text easily and efficiently information structure is analysis is a highly useful tm technique that has attracted_increasing recently it aims to classify units of text typically sentences into a fixed number of categories which capture different types of information in text for instance is categories could capture the aim of the study or a type of the study e g animal human and in vitro the design of experiments e g exposure length v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com dose and group size the results obtained e g end_points positive_or results the conclusions drawn and so forth to date several is schemes have been proposed for the analysis of scientific documents there are coarse_grained schemes that stem from typical section headings seen in academic journals as well as finer grained schemes among the latter are those based on the rhetorical structure and scientific argumentation of a scientific paper namely argumentative zones azs the qualitative dimensions or the properties of factual information e g focus polarity certainty evidence and directionality the distinction between different types of evidence in empirical_studies e g explicit versus implicit claims correlations comparisons and observations and the content and conceptual_framework for a scientific investigation among others automatic labeling of biomedical_text according to is has many practical_applications it has been shown to support a variety of biotm tasks e g information_retrieval information_extraction and text summarization and manual study of biomedical_literature for example reported a speed reading test where is annotations significantly speeded up literature_review in cancer risk_assessment however the usefulness of is analysis has been limited by the fact that existing_approaches suffer from poor portability biomedicine is subject to considerable sub domain variation at different levels of linguistic description application of is analysis to different sub domains of biomedicine e g chemistry molecular_biology and cancer research has required the development of domain specific training and evaluation data created by hand such data are very expensive to develop and are only available for a handful of sub domains recent research has investigated reducing the need for annotations via lightly supervised_learning e g active_learning of is this research has produced useful resultsaccurate enough to support high_speed literature_review however such an approach still requires several hundreds of annotated sentences for optimal_performance this is unrealistic as biomedical_literature is not only varied in terms of domains but also highly_dynamic this article investigates whether unsupervised methods could be realistic for is analysis such methods have the distinct advantage of removing the need for any is annotation not only would this allow for easily applying the approach to the many sub domains where annotated data are not readily available but it could also lead to the discovery of novel undefined information categories emerging from the data we experiment with a large corpus of biomedical abstracts annotated according to two different is schemes section names sn and azs we apply to this corpus two canonical clustering_algorithms spherical k means and expectation maximizationgaussian mixture_model em gmm as well as the state of the art multilevel weighted graph clustering_algorithm which is an efficient approximation of the very popular spectral_clustering the latter algorithm has the added advantage that it avoids expensive eigenvector computation by exploiting weighted kernel k means to locally optimize graph_clustering objectives using a selection of clustering evaluation metrics we evaluate these algorithms on the two is schemes comparing them against fully supervised and weakly supervised algorithms our unsupervised_approach performs surprisingly well especially when multilevel weighted graph_clustering is applied to the sn scheme we obtain over f scores for most categoriesperformance which is close to that of lightly supervised methods and which has proven sufficient to aid practical tasks in biomedicine we also demonstrate that unsupervised_learning brings novel insights into is of biomedical_literature and discovers information categories that are not present in any of the existing is schemes there is only one previous study in unsupervised is analysis which focused on detecting sns they used probabilistic_graphical and reported an f score of which is rather low and unlikely to be used in real_world tasks our results suggest that if we use more sophisticated unsupervised techniques and better features is analysis could realistically be used to benefit a much wider_range of tasks in biomedicine to summarize in this article we investigate canonical and stateof the art clustering_algorithms for is analysis of biomedical_literature this is the first study of unsupervised is analysis that uses sophisticated unsupervised_learning techniques that may beover the average

unsupervised_learning brings new insights into is analysis and allows for the possibility of discovering novel information categories we have demonstrated the potential of clustering and have shown that clustering can detect valuable new information in data in the future we would like to pursue unsupervised_learning further and learn feature representations as well rather than pre defining them
