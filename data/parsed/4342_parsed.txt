genome_analysis sparkseq fast scalable and cloud ready tool for the interactive genomic_data analysis with nucleotide precision many time consuming analyses of next_generation data can be addressed with modern cloud_computing the apache hadoop based_solutions have become popular in gen omics because of their scalability in a cloud infrastructure so_far most of these tools have been used for batch data_processing rather than interactive data querying the sparkseq software has been created to take advantage of a new mapreduce framework apache spark for next generation sequen_cing data sparkseq is a general_purpose flexible and easily extend able library for genomic cloud_computing it can be used to build genomic analysis_pipelines in scala and run them in an interactive way sparkseq opens up the possibility of customized ad_hoc secondary_analyses and iterative machine_learning this article demonstrates its scalability and overall fast performance by running the analyses of sequencing_datasets tests of sparkseq also prove that the use of cache and hdfs block size can be tuned for the optimal_performance on multiple worker nodes availability_and available under open_source apache license https bitbucket org mwiewiorka sparkseq
