genome_analysis cassis detection of genomic rearrangement breakpoints genomes undergo large structural changes that alter their organization the chromosomal_regions affected by these rearrangements are called breakpoints while those which have not been rearranged are called synteny_blocks lemaitre et_al presented a new method to precisely delimit rearrangement breakpoints in a genome by comparison with the genome of a related species receiving as input a list of one one orthologous_genes found in the genomes of two species the method builds a set of reliable and non overlapping synteny_blocks and refines the regions that are not contained into them through the alignment of each breakpoint sequence against its specific orthologous sequences in the other species we can look for weak similarities inside the breakpoint thus extending the synteny_blocks and narrowing the breakpoints the identification of the narrowed breakpoints relies on a segmentation_algorithm and is statistically assessed here we present the package cassis that implements this method of precise detection of genomic rearrangement breakpoints availability perl and r scripts are freely_available for download atlarge scale modifications of the genome such as inversions or transpositions of dna_segments translocations between nonhomologous chromosomes fusions or fissions of chromosomes and deletions or duplications of small or large portions are called rearrangements they are further involved in evolution speciation and also in cancer to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as one crucial step before analysing the rearrangements and their possible relation with other genomic_features is to locate these events on a genome in the case of two genomes it is possible to identify conserved_regions also known as synteny_blocks by comparing the order and orientation of orthologous markers along their chromosome sequences a region_located between two consecutive synteny_blocks on one genome whose orthologous blocks are rearranged in the other genome not consecutive or not in the same relative orientations is called breakpoint as far as we know current methods for detecting breakpoints grimm synteny mauve for example are in fact strategies for detecting synteny_blocks they provide the coordinates of the breakpoint regions only as a byproduct simply by returning regions that are not found in a conserved synteny developed a formal method that aims to go one step further and to extend the synteny_blocks by focusing on the breakpoints themselves this method was shown to improve significantly the precision of breakpoint locations on mammalian_genomes and enables to better characterize breakpoint sequences and distributions see also datasets and comparisons available together with the package the first step of the method is to process a list of orthologous_genes to identify synteny_blocks between the genomes of two related species a reference_genome g r and a second genome g o this step outputs a list of ordered and non intersecting synteny_blocks that are used to identify the breakpoints for each breakpoint on the genome g r we can define three sequences the breakpoint sequence s r and its two orthologous sequences on the second genome g o s oa and s ob in a second step the method aligns the breakpoint sequence s r against s oa and s ob and the information provided by the hits of the alignments is coded along s r as a sequence of discrete values a segmentation_algorithm calculates the best segmentation of this sequence of discrete values into at most three segments a segment related with s oa a segment related with s ob and a central segment which will represent the refined breakpoint
