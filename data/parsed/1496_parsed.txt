dsk k_mer with very low memory_usage counting all the k_mers substrings of length k in dna rna sequencing_reads is the preliminary step of many bioinformatics applications however state of the art k_mer counting_methods require that a large data_structure resides in memory such structure typically grows with the number of distinct k_mers to count we present a new streaming algorithm for k_mer called dsk disk streaming of k_mers which only requires a fixed user_defined amount of memory and disk_space this approach realizes a memory time and disk trade_off the multi set of all k_mers present in the reads is partitioned and partitions are saved to disk then each partition is separately loaded in memory in a temporary hash_table the k_mer counts are returned by traversing each hash_table low_abundance k_mers are optionally filtered dsk is the first approach that is able to count all the mers of a human_genome dataset using only gb of memory and moderate disk_space gb in h dsk can replace a popular k_mer software jellyfish on small memory servers availability http minia determining the abundance of each distinct k_mer in a set of sequencing_reads is a conceptually_simple yet fundamental task it is used in many bioinformatics applications related to sequencing e g genome and transcriptome_assembly variants detection and read_error for de_novo one is often interested in counting k_mers to discard those with low_abundance which likely stem from sequencing_errors state of the art methods for k_mer rely on hash tables jellyfish marcaismarcais and and or bloom filters bfcounter these structures need to reside in memory for random_access sequencing_errors induce erroneous k_mers in a volume typically greater or comparable with that of correct k_mers hence counting k_mers for a human dataset with either a single hash_table or a bloom_filter is a task that requires tens of gigabytes of memory in section we describe a fixed memory and fixed disk_space streaming algorithm dsk disk streaming of k_mers and its worst_case complexity is analysed in function of the desired memory and disk usage in section dsk is used to count all the mers of a whole_genome human dataset the trade_off between memory and disk_space is analysed on two smaller datasets we conclude with a discussion of the advantages of dsk over related methods
