systems_biology ultranet efficient solver for the sparse inverse covariance selection problem in gene network modeling graphical gaussian models ggms are a promising approach to identify gene_regulatory such models can be robustly inferred by solving the sparse inverse covariance selection sics problem with the high_dimensionality of genomics data fast methods capable of solving large instances of sics are needed we developed a novel network modeling tool ultranet that solves the sics problem with significantly improved_efficiency ultranet combines a range of mathematical and programmatical techniques exploits the structure of the sics problem and enables computation of genome_scale ggms without compromising analytic accuracy availability_and ultranet is implemented in c and available at www broadinstitute org ultranet graphical gaussian models ggms are rapidly gaining traction as a promising approach to identify gene_regulatory from genomics data schaferschafer and ggms are created by estimating the inverse of the sample covariance_matrix s and then computing the partial correlation_matrix assuming that the observations typically gene_expression values have a multivariate_gaussian p ij indicates that variables genes i and j are conditionally independent given the other variables i e all correlation between them can be explained by co correlation with other variables p ij indicates that they are conditionally dependent i e the correlation between them cannot be explained in full by co correlation with other observed variables the advantage of ggms is that edges non zero p ij s are more likely to reflect direct dependencies between genes than edges in correlation networks schafer alongside computing a relevant input matrix the difficulty with ggm networks is to estimate a robust way to achieve this is to solve the penalized log likelihood_maximization problem arg max
