genetics_and phewas demonstrating the feasibility of a phenome wide scan to discover gene_disease motivationnumerous genome_wide gwass have been performed using disease specific definitions to identify novel genetic_associations for many diseases these to whom correspondence should be addressed gwas typically derive their cases and controls from clinical_trials observational cohorts and more recently electronic_medical emr systems several gwass have successfully investigated multiple_phenotypes using a single cohort of genotyped samples the growth of available genomic_data some of which is linked to rich phenotypic_data such as that which is available in emr systems suggests it would be possible to perform a reverse gwasdetermining for a given genotype the range of associated clinical_phenotypes the ability to conduct a true phenome wide scan in an unbiased way can ultimately become a path to discover new genetic_associations gain insights into disease mechanisms and determine_whether polymorphisms or variants exist which confer broad susceptibility to multiple_diseases across the phenome while the concept of a phenome wide scan is not new to our knowledge methodology to perform such a scan in a systematic high_throughput and reproducible fashion has not been developed in this article we present an algorithm to perform an initial phenomewide association scans phewas or phenome_wide study this adaptation uses readily available billing codes to replicate several known genotypephenotype associations and suggests novel possible associations deployment of emr systems for routine_clinical has improved the quality of patient_care reduced_cost and has provided a longitudinal record of care available for clinical and translational_research typical emr systems contain diverse data_sources including billing data laboratory and imaging results medication records and clinical_documentation these data have proven useful for applied clinical research studies and for phenotyping in focused genomic studies emr data have also proven useful in research studies looking across many phenotypes such as drugadverse effect detection and mining for genetic overlaps among diseases research_involving emr systems often involves processing both structured e g billing codes and unstructured data e g clinical_documentation generated by physicians in the usa most clinical_encounters generate international_classification icd version cm codes as a mechanism for billing for a given procedure test or clinical visit the icd_coding system contains over disease codes grouped into a multi level hierarchy ofpage we present an algorithm to facilitate the performance of phenomewide associated studies to detect diseasegene associations using icd billing codes this proof_of study applied this algorithm to five snps with seven known disease associations this study found that four of these previously known snp disease associations from the literature were identified using our phewas algorithm and also indicated other potential disease gene_associations not previously investigated as the high_density genotype data becomes increasingly available such phenomewide scans may have great utility to both discover new genetic_associations and provide greater insight to the biology underlying certain associations an exciting consequence of phewas analyses is that they in combination with gwas or candidate_gene studies may help elucidate new biology for example gwas identified associations with genetic_variation in intergenic_regions could be investigated with phewas to discover other potential associations in this study the p region identified by rs was also associated with portal thrombosis intracranial_hemorrhage and phlebitis and thrombophlebitis possibly suggesting a common etiology related to coagulation that could be investigated with subsequent adequately_powered studies phewas analyses may also help identify potentially causative associations between disease and snp associations discovered in disease specific gwas when performing a gwas in isolation one may discover an association between an infection and a given snp such as pneumonia and rs and potentially conclude that the snp confers susceptibility the alternative explanation is that this snp increases the likelihood of autoimmune_diseases and the treatment for the autoimmune_disease such as corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive_agents may be the causative_agent similar to gwas the current phewas study highlights the statistical challenges associated with analyzing high_dimensionality data in this analysis few diseasegene associations were significant when a bonferroni_correction was applied however there are several reasons to suggest that a bonferroni_correction is too conservative unlike gwas in which nearly every individual will have a genotype value for that snp and thus its statistical_power is limited primarily by the minor_allele and genetic effect_size i e or phewas is limited by these factors and the prevalence of the disease in the population which is often of the population thus for most diseases it may be unreasonable to expect p values as extreme as seen in gwas with similar population_sizes indeed several prior known gene_disease in this study had p values between and furthermore many diseases are associated with each other in much the same was as snps may be in linkage_disequilibrium with each other for example cd and non infectious gastroenteritis both associated with rs not only represent similar conditions but often referred to the same individuals of those with non infectious gastroenteritis had both conditions these collocations of disease reduce the hypothesis space and lend greater strength to the validity of discovered associations like gwas the true significance_level of clinical and genetic interest will need to be experimentally_determined with future study while the associations in this study were often weak due to the small_sample for individual disease codes the power of these data will only increase as more genetic data is deposited as is policy into the biovu resource for reuse the ability to detect true signals with sufficient_statistical even for rare_diseases will be enhanced furthermore the broad availability of icd_codes permits easy portability to other institutions and offers the potential of cross institution application this phewas study did not replicate three of the seven previously known snpdisease associations our review of these cases revealed that each of these three icd_code groups contained a number_of in which billing codes were recorded as a hypothetical reason for a test repeating the study using only true_positive cases revealed that af or p and sle or p both replicated the previously_reported associations and cas or p trended in a similar direction as previously_noted further work to refine the phewas case algorithms may improve performance beyond using prevalent icd_codes incorporation of laboratory data natural_language and machine_learning may improve case accuracy limitations caution interpretation of this initial feasibility study this study was performed in a single_institution with five snps other institutions may have different coding practices which can affect the ability to replicate these results if the phewas is undertaken at another institution to define phenotypes in a highthroughput fashion we used groupings of icd billing codes which
