systems_biology an improved constraint filtering technique for inferring hidden_states and parameters of a biological model motivation in systems_biology kinetic_models represent the biological system using a set of ordinary_differential odes the correct values of the parameters within these odes are critical for a reliable study of the dynamic behaviour of such systems typically it is only possible to experimentally measure a fraction of these parameter_values the rest must be indirectly determined from measurements of other quantities in this article we propose a novel statistical_inference technique to computationally estimate these unknown parameter_values by characterizing the odes with non linear state_space equations this inference technique models the unknown_parameters as hidden_states which can then be estimated from noisy measurement data results here we extended the square_root unscented_kalman sr ukf proposed by merwe and wan to include constraints with the state_estimation process we developed the constrained square_root unscented_kalman csukf to estimate_parameters of non linear state_space models this probabilistic_inference technique was successfully used to estimate_parameters of a glycolysis model in yeast and a gene_regulatory we showed that our method is numerically stable and can reliably estimate_parameters within a biologically_meaningful parameter_space from noisy observations when compared with the two common non linear extensions of kalman_filter in addition to four widely used global optimization algorithms csukf is shown to be both accurate and computationally_efficient with csukf statistical_analysis is straightforward as it directly provides the uncertainty on the estimation result availability_and matlab_code available upon request from theliving organisms develop a highly interconnected web of dynamic mechanisms between different levels of molecular_components which are organized into diverse biochemical_reaction a better understanding of the general principles of these biological_processes requires a system level study of the underlying_mechanisms the integration of computational and mathematical_methods with experimental efforts is necessary to gain such systems level understanding in systems_biology the specific type of modelling that studies the detailed quantitative analysis of the dynamics of cellular_processes is mechanistic or kinetic modelling such models are often characterized by sets of ordinary_differential odes that describe the underlying interactive mechanisms of the system in a quantitative_manner they account for the change of concentration of certain chemical_species such as the metabolites messenger_rna mrna or proteins over time these changes are specified through the rate laws which are determined from in vitro biochemical_experiments the rate laws may have multiple parameters that need to be determined correctly to faithfully mimic observations while it might be possible to experimentally measure some of these parameters for most of them conducting biological_experiments to determine their values are difficult expensive time consuming or not currently possible as a result different computational_techniques have been developed for the indirect determination of these unknown parameter_values from some other measured quantities in general the parameter_estimation problem is formulated as a non linear optimization_problem that aims at minimizing the difference between simulated and measured values from experimental time course data starting with an initial guess these methods exhaustively search the parameter_space to find the set of values that produce the best fit between the simulated and the measured data extensive research_exists on the application of different optimization techniques such as non linear least square fitting and methods following steepest descent gradient techniques methods suitable for global optimization including simulated_annealing sa and evolutionary computation but due to the non linear nature of the dynamics the optimization_problems of biochemical_networks are most often multimodal exploring such parameter_space is computationally_expensive for these optimization techniques moreover they often get stuck in local_minima their performance also suffers in the presence of large measurement errors this is compounded as few optimization techniques are to whom correspondence should be addressed able to take into consideration the system noise an alternative to traditional optimization_methods is to use the bayesian inference_method this method_takes both the system and measurement noise into consideration when extracting information from noisy or uncertain data the major advantage is its ability to infer the full probability_distribution of the states and the parameters instead of making a simple point_estimate this method tries to estimate the posterior_distribution of the parameter conditioned on the observed data y pjy however the calculation of this posterior density involves high_dimensional integration for which analytical expressions are generally not available their numerical solution might also be computationally_challenging as the problem is translated to a combinatorial summation problem the markov_chain mcmc method which works with batch data has the capability to represent the posterior_distribution numerically recently mcmc techniques have been widely used in biological_systems for predicting different targets sequential approaches such as the sequential monte_carlo smc also known as particle filters and kalman filtering type approaches were primarily developed for data produced in a sequential fashion these methods yield better approximations compared with the batch processing algorithms when applied to the whole data there has been extensive research in recent_years to apply the sequential approximation methods to estimate states and parameters in biological_systems the work of demonstrate the applicability of the smc in the state_estimation of biological_models although smc or particle filters are more sophisticated than the kalman filtering_methods they involve calculation of several hyper parameters and have to solve numerous sets of odes which leads to a high_computational reported that parameter_estimation using particle_filtering for a regular size biological model requires the cost of petascale computing such large_scale computing can only be performed with high end clusters and supercomputers in that respect kalman filtering_methods are much more suitable for biological_systems as they are less resource_intensive in terms of computational_cost to date efforts have been made to apply kalman filteringbased methods to estimate_parameters of biological_systems to name a few in this article we propose a new form of the unscented_kalman for the estimation of unknown parameter_values of biological_systems within a constrained boundary unlike other non linear extensions to the kalman_filter kf this algorithm remains numerically stable we illustrate the efficiency of this method by estimating the unknown_parameters and hidden_states of two different systems the first system is the upper part of glycolysis in yeast modified from with this we study the parameter_estimation of a medium_size kinetic_model the second model is from the dream contest on the estimation of model parameter challenge the result from the parameter_estimation of these models clearly demonstrates the applicability of our newly_proposed algorithm to much larger and real_life biological_models
