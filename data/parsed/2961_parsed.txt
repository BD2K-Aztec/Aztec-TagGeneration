databases_and microbedb a locally maintainable database of microbial genomic_sequences analysis of microbial_genomes often requires the general organization and comparison of tens to thousands of genomes both from public_repositories and unpublished sources microbedb provides a foundation for such projects by the automation of downloading published completed bacterial and archaeal genomes from key sources parsing annotations of all genomes both public and private into a local database and allowing interaction with the database through an easy to use programming interface microbedb creates a simple to use easy to maintain centralized local resource for various large_scale comparative genomic_analyses and a back end for future microbial application design the study of bacterial and archaeal genomes has rapidly progressed from the analysis of single genomes to comparisons between hundreds and thousands any type of biological analyses or development of novel bioinformatic_methods that uses more than a handful of genomes requires a basic but non trivial method for obtaining organizing and storing this genomic_information in the past this has been a problem primarily limited to large_scale data providers such as img ncbi gold and cmr although many of these centers provide genomic_data in a variety of static formats such as genbank and fasta these are often inadequate for complex queries to carry out these analyses efficiently a relational_database such as mysql http mysql com can be used to allow rapid querying across many genomes at once some existing data providers such as cmr allow downloading of their database files directly but these databases are designed for large web_based infrastructures and contain numerous tables that demand a steep learning_curve also addition of unpublished genomes to these databases is often not supported a well known and widely used system is the generic model_organism database gmod
