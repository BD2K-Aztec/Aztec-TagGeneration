data_and prediction of potential disease associated micrornas based on random_walk motivation identifying micrornas associated with diseases disease mirnas is helpful for exploring the pathogenesis of diseases because mirnas fulfill function via the regulation of their target_genes and because the current number of experimentally_validated targets is insufficient some existing_methods have inferred potential disease mirnas based on the predicted targets it is difficult for these methods to achieve excellent_performance due to the high false_positive for the target prediction results alternatively several methods have constructed a network composed of mirnas based on their associated diseases and have exploited the information within the network to predict the disease mirnas however these methods have failed to take into account the prior information regarding the network nodes and the respective local topological structures of the different categories of nodes therefore it is essential to develop a method that exploits the more useful information to predict reliable disease mirna candidates results mirnas with similar functions are normally associated with similar diseases and vice_versa therefore the functional_similarity between a pair of mirnas is calculated based on their associated diseases to construct a mirna network we present a new prediction method based on random_walk on the network for the diseases with some known related_mirnas the network nodes are divided_into labeled nodes and unlabeled nodes and the transition matrices are established for the two categories of nodes furthermore different categories of nodes have different transition weights in this way the prior information of nodes can be completely exploited simultaneously the various ranges of topologies around the different categories of nodes are integrated in addition how far the walker can go away from the labeled nodes is controlled by restarting the walking this is helpful for relieving the negative effect of noisy_data for the diseases without any known related_mirnas we extend the walking on a mirna disease bilayer network during the prediction process the similarity between diseases the similarity between mirnas the known mirna disease associations and the topology_information of the bilayer network are exploited moreover the importance of information from different layers of network is considered our method achieves_superior for human_diseases with auc values ranging from to moreover case studies on breast neoplasms lung neoplasms prostatic neo plasms and diseases further confirm the ability of our method to discover potential disease mirnas micrornas mirnas are small_non that play_important in gene_regulation by targeting mrnas for cleavage or translational_repression recently accumulating_evidence has indicated that mirna dysregulation is closely_related to the development progression and prognosis of various human_diseases therefore identifying the mirnas associated with diseases disease mirnas contributes to the exploration of the pathogenesis of diseases recently computational_prediction have been used to obtain reliable disease mirna candidates for further experimental_studies since mirnas fulfill their functions via the regulation of target_mrnas target_genes expression several methods based on the targets have been presented estimated the similarity between mirnas by measuring the similarity of their associated target_genes the mirna network based on targets was combined with a disease phenotype network to infer the correlation scores between mirnas and diseases in addition they improved the score calculation by further integrating the similarities of mirnas with the phenotype similarities of diseases also collected mirna_targets and measured the function consistence score fcs between the target_genes and the disease related genes however when calculating the fcs this method ignored the topological_structure that is composed of the targets and disease genes moreover as the current number of targets that have been verified by biological_experiments is insufficient both jiang and li obtained the target_genes by using target prediction programs such as targetscan and pita because these programs have high false_positive it is difficult for the methods based on targets to achieve high prediction_performance exploited the functional link between mirna_targets and disease genes in proteinprotein_interaction to identify mirnadisease associations this method was also affected by the low accuracy of target prediction in addition it ignored the functional_similarity between genes it is well known that mirnas with similar functions are normally implicated in similar diseases and vice_versa chens method focused on the phenotype similarity between diseases and the associations between mirnas and diseases for a specific mirna m i the novel diseases that are similar to the known m i related_diseases were obtained as m i related candidates due to not considering the similarity between mirnas this method could not achieve excellent_performance as the functionally related_mirnas tend to be associated with similar diseases the functional_similarity of two mirnas has been successfully estimated based on the semantic similarities of their associated diseases hdmp integrated the functional_similarities with the characteristics of mirnas to predict candidates associated with a given disease it only considered the k most similar neighbors of a candidate and ignored the topology formed by the neighbors to construct a mirna network derived from mirna associated diseases the functional_similarity between any two mirnas was used as the weight of edge connecting them by integrating known mirna disease associations the similarity between diseases and the mirna network rlsmda developed the prediction method based on regularized least_squares to uncover potential mirna candidates for a specific disease rlsmda achieved excellent prediction_performance not only for the diseases with some related_mirnas but also for the diseases without any known related_mirnas unfortunately it ignored the topology_information of the mirna network rwrmda obtained the putative disease mirnas that have similar functions to known disease mirnas via random_walk through the mirna network however the network is composed of two categories of nodes for a specific disease some nodes are validated by biological_experiments to be implicated in the disease but the other nodes have no evidence to verify their association with the disease unfortunately the prior information regarding the two categories of nodes and their respective local topological structures are not considered therefore we propose a novel prediction method based on random_walk which exploits the characteristics of the nodes and the various ranges of topologies in addition we extend the walk on a mirna disease bilayer network to predict candidates specially for the diseases without any known related_mirnas a new method based on random_walk midp was developed to predict potential mirna candidates for the diseases with knownprediction of potential disease associated micrornasrelated mirnas we constructed the mirna network derived from mirna associated diseases to integrate the similarities between nodes the prior information of nodes and the local topological_structure based on the characteristics of the labeled and unlabeled nodes their transition matrices were established the transition probability between the nodes was proportional to the similarity between them the labeled nodes were assigned higher transition weight than the unlabeled nodes which efficiently exploited the prior information of nodes and the various ranges of topologies the degree to which the walker could deviate from the labeled nodes was controlled by restarting the walking this effectively relieved the negative effect of noisy_data in addition an extension method midpe was proposed specially for the diseases without any known related_mirnas the mirna disease bilayer network was constructed to integrate the information in mirna network derived from mirna associated diseases mnet and the information in disease network dnet the transition_matrix for the bilayer network was constructed according to the association degree between the mirna node or the disease node and a given disease at the same time the information in mnet and that in dnet were assigned different weights to balance their relative importance similarly the restart probability in the bilayer network controlled how far the walker can go away from the starting node midp was compared with rwrmda hdmp rlsmda and chens method midpe was compared with rlsmda which was the single method applied to the diseases without known related_mirnas before the results demonstrated that midp and midpe have superior prediction_performance the cross_validation and the case studies indicated that midp and midpe are powerful not only for capturing known disease mirnas but also for discovering potential candidates it will be useful for providing reliable candidates for future_studies of mirna involvement in the pathogenesis of diseases literature means that there is a literature to support that a mirna is upregulated or downregulated in human lung neoplasm as compared with normal_lung literature represents that a mirna is related to some important factors_affecting the development of lung neoplasms with analysis of the microarray_data a mirna is considered to potentially have different express levels in lung_cancer when compared with normal_tissues this kind of mirnas is labeled by dbdemc mir disease means that a mirna is included in the manually_curated mirna disease association database mir disease phenomir means a mirna has dysregulation expression in lung_cancer genecards provides comprehensive_information on all known human genes including mirnas genecards means the database recorded that a mirna was associated with lung_cancer cluster represents a mirna and another mirna are clustered and the latter was associated with lung neoplasms
