databases_and gepdb a database for investigating the ternary association of genotype gene_expression and phenotype gepdb integrates both genome_wide and expression_quantitative information the two primary_sources of genome_wide mapping for genotypephenotype and geno typeexpression associations together with phenotype associated gene_lists the gepdb provides simultaneous interpretation of both genetic risks and potential gene regulatory_pathways toward phenotypic outcome by establishing the ternary relationship of geno typeexpressionphenotype gep the analytic scope is further extended by linkage_disequilibrium from five different populations of the international_hapmap availability_and http ercsbweb genome_wide gwas and expression_quantitative eqtl are the principal methods for genomescale mapping of genotypephenotype and genotypeexpression relationships respectively in most cases gwas provides little information on the underlying mechanism at the molecular and cellular levels a recent survey showed that of the gwas hits fall into coding_regions allowing direct interpretation of protein structural and functional_impacts the majority of hit single_nucleotide snps may have some regulatory_function through transcriptional_regulation mirna targeting or epigenetic changes therefore if there are common_snps shared by both gwas and eqtl the eqtl genes are good candidates for the underlying pathological_process and its phenotypic outcome many dedicated databases have been developed for either gwas or eqtl there are few integrated databases for both gwas and eqtl data that i support a mechanistic interpretation of gwas results and ii infer causal genetic_variations responsible for differential_expression of disease signature genes via eqtl_mapping we developed gepdb that seamlessly integrates a comprehensive collection of gwas eqtl and phenotype associated gene_lists such integration provides a novel opportunity to analyze the ternary relationship of genotypeexpressionphenotype gep in a genome_scale the hit snps tagging_snps may belong to a haplotype block whereas their neighboring snps may be actually functional in both gwas and eqtl_mapping by linkage_disequilibrium ld gepdb supports expansion of snps using ld_information a critical question regarding the gep ternary relationship is to what extent the expression signatures degs can be interpreted by gwas hit snps via i eqtl and further by ii ld_information among the datasets compiled in the gepdb we analyzed paired sets of the gwas hit snps and the gene_signatures from gad and genesigdb annotated by the same disease using mesh_terms and manual_inspection the coverage of the signature genes by gwas hit snps via eqtl ld varied highly depending a genesigdb and b gad by the gwas hit snps via eqtl_mapping blue and ld eqtl_mapping green the gwas hit snps are merged together for each disease if there are multiple gwas for a single diseaseon the disease category and individual study the median coverage was and by eqtl and ld eqtl respectively and some signature genes resulted in no outcome the overall low coverage may at least partially result from inaccurate mapping between gwas and the corresponding expression signatures because of disease_subtypes or heterogeneity nevertheless a significant fraction of known gene_signatures were traced back to their potential genetic risks using gepdb g e mode similarly any set of gene_signatures or candidate snps can also be analyzed using the g e p or p e g modes to generate testable_hypotheses
