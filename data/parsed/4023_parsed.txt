genetics_and r mpmap a computational platform for the genetic_analysis of multiparent recombinant_inbred multiparent crosses of recombinant_inbred provide opportunity to map markers and quantitative_trait qtl with much greater resolution than is possible in biparental crosses realizing the full potential of these crosses requires computational_tools capable of handling the increased statistical complexity of the analyses r mpmap provides a flexible and extensible environment which interfaces easily with other packages to satisfy this demand functions in the package encompass simulation marker map construction haplotype reconstruction and qtl_mapping we demonstrate the easy to use features of mpmap through a simulated_data example multiparent recombinant_inbred ril crosses are a new type of experimental_design already they are being implemented in mice arabidopsis rice and wheat their growing popularity stems from their potential for increased mapping resolution and their ability to capture a wide_range of genetic_and from a breeding_population as yet however there are few computational_tools for the analysis of these data existing analysis software for biparental crosses cannot be applied directly or extended easily to these new designs analysis software for biparental crosses relies on being able to unambiguously infer the parental origin of allelic information from the observed marker data since this does not hold for multiparent crosses analysis software for multiparent crosses must contend with all patterns of allelic segregation which are consistent with the observed marker data and their associated probabilities two software_packages have been developed for the analysis of data from multiparent ril crossesr qtl and r happy both packages focus primarily on quantitative_trait qtl_mapping in contrast we have developed mpmap as a comprehensive suite of functions for multiparent designs in close consultation with plant breeders and to whom correspondence should be addressed geneticists in addition to native functions mpmap interfaces with both r qtl and r happy and is easily extensible this versatile software helps meet the urgent need for analysis tools capable of handling the complexities associated with multiparent inbred line crosses in this article we have described an exciting new computer package for the analysis of marker and trait data from complex multiparent ril crosses with mpmap users are now in a position to simulate data construct marker maps examine the genomic_structure of individuals and perform qtl_mapping on these cutting_edge experimental_designs our package differs from existing r packages mainly in the extensive facility for map construction in addition mpmap unifies some of the functionality currently available in other packages and adds new approaches and visualization functions it thus equips breeders and geneticists with a wide_variety of practical tools to dissect the genetics of complex_traits we do recognize that for large n crosses computation will be demanding estimating recombination fractions scales linearly with lines and founders but quadratically with markers we are currently working to parallelize the analysis process through the use of machines with graphics_processing preliminary_results indicate that we can reduce computation time by two orders_of
