genome_analysis fsr feature_set reduction for scalable and accurate multi class cancer subtype classification based on copy_number motivation feature_selection is a key concept in machine_learning for microarray_datasets where features represented by probesets are typically several orders_of larger than the available sample_size computational tractability is a key challenge for feature_selection in handling very high_dimensional beyond a hundred thousand features such as in datasets produced on single_nucleotide microarrays in this article we present a novel feature_set reduction approach that enables scalable feature_selection on datasets with hundreds of thousands of features and beyond our approach_enables more efficient handling of higher_resolution datasets to achieve better disease subtype classification of samples for potentially more accurate_diagnosis and prognosis which allows clinicians to make more informed decisions in regards to patient treatment_options results we applied our feature_set reduction approach to several publicly_available cancer single_nucleotide snp_array datasets and evaluated its performance in terms of its multiclass predictive classification_accuracy over different cancer_subtypes its speedup in execution as well as its scalability with respect to sample_size and array resolution feature_set reduction fsr was able to reduce the dimensions of an snp_array dataset by more than two orders_of while achieving at least equal and in most cases superior predictive classification_performance over that achieved on features selected by existing feature_selection alone an examination of the biological_relevance of frequently selected_features from fsr reduced feature_sets revealed strong enrichment in association with cancer availability fsr was implemented in matlab r b and is available atan open_problem in the field of microarray_analysis is the classification of samples in terms of their cancer subtype using to whom correspondence should be addressed copy_number data derived from high_density snp_arrays accurate classification of clinically_important subtypes can help define subgroups of patients who would benefit from more individualized treatment regimes while classification of microarray_data has received considerable interest in the gene_expression domain challenges of a different nature arise when dealing with copy_number in high_density snp_array datasets snp microarray_datasets have more features than gene_expression typically gene_expression can comprise tens_of of features genes while snp_array datasets can comprise hundreds of thousands of features snps this implies that in snp_array datasets the number of features are typically several orders_of larger than the available sample_size consequently feature_selection approaches that work well on gene_expression may not necessarily scale well to the increased number of features in snp_array datasets moreover snp microarray_datasets possess a lower signal_to in comparison to gene_expression the raw copy_number measurements can thus be extremely noisy as compared with gene_expression on microarray_datasets while there have been previous attempts at classifying datasets generated from snp microarrays these studies were largely based on the earliest generation of snp microarrays with features which makes these datasets similar in dimensions to gene_expression therefore the challenges in scalability are not as apparent in these datasets among these studieswas based solely on genotype data from snp microarray_datasets and not copy_number data whereas wang was based only on loss_of loh data that is derived from genotype_calls other earlier attempts at classifying samples based on copy_number datasets were largely based on the lower_resolution array_comparative acgh technology again the issue of scalability was not explored since the number of features in acgh is much smaller than those of the affymetrix snp_array the scalability of feature_selection in snp_array datasets with large_numbers of features for the purpose of sample classification is an open_problem that needs to be addressed our aim in this article is to propose a feature_reduction approach that is computationally more efficient than existing feature_selection approaches while achieving at least comparable or superior classification_accuracy when applied to copy numberpage in this article we have presented a novel feature_set reduction method fsr we have demonstrated its effectiveness in pruning complete feature_sets involving a variety of cancers down to compact sets of potentially interesting_features which ultimately yielded better predictive classification_accuracy for an svm trained on these features we have shown that fsr is computationally_efficient the speedup in empirical runtimes achieved with an fsr hybrid feature_selection approach was at least an order of magnitude faster as compared with feature_selection using the respective stand alone approach fsr paired approaches also demonstrated significantly better classification_accuracy over their stand alone counterparts in many of the test scenarios the performance of fsr has implications and applications in the field of cancer_genomics cancer is often regarded as a single disease with many variations each subtype of cancer has a different set of risk_factors different rates of progression different treatment_options and a different prognosis being able to classify cancer_subtypes more accurately from selected biomarkers can be useful in achieving a more accurate prognosis of the disease as well as in making more informed choices about treatment_options from a computational perspective the ability to prune feature_sets with minimal_loss of information facilitates the subsequent application of a wider selection of feature_selection approaches some of which may have been intractable on the original feature_set due to its size fsr is suited for application on high_density microarray_datasets to analyze diseases such as cancer that typically have a small to moderate number of classes reflecting subtypes grades or stages of the disease as microarray resolution grows to improve coverage of the human_genome fsr can be a useful tool in enhancing the computational_efficiency and predictive_accuracy of disease subtype classification tasks performed on the datasets produced on these microarrays for potentially more accurate disease_prognosis and personalized treatment
