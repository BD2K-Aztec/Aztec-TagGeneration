gene_expression inferring condition specific mirna_activity from matched mirna and mrna_expression data motivation micrornas mirnas play crucial roles in complex cellular_networks by binding to the messenger_rnas mrnas of protein_coding it has been found that mirna regulation is often condition specific a number of computational_approaches have been developed to identify mirna_activity specific to a condition of interest using gene_expression data however most of the methods only use the data in a single condition and thus the activity discovered may not be unique to the condition of interest additionally these methods are based on statistical associations between the gene_expression levels of mirnas and mrnas so they may not be able to reveal real gene regulatory_relationships which are causal_relationships results we propose a novel method to infer condition specific mirna_activity by considering i the difference between the regulatory behavior that an mirna has in the condition of interest and its behavior in the other conditions ii the causal semantics of mirnamrna relationships the method is applied to the epithelialmesenchymal transition emt and multi class cancer mcc datasets the validation by the results of transfection experiments shows that our approach is effective in discovering significant mirnamrna interactions functional and pathway analysis and literature validation indicate that the identified active mirnas are closely associated with the specific biological_processes diseases and pathways more detailed analysis of the activity of the active mirnas implies that some active mirnas show different regulation types in different conditions but some have the same regulation types and their activity only differs in different conditions in the strengths of regulation
