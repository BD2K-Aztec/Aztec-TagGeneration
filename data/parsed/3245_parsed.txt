databases_and neuropedia neuropeptide database and spectral library neuropeptides are essential for cellcell communication in neurological and endocrine physiological_processes in health and disease while many neuropeptides have been identified in previous_studies the resulting data has not been structured to facilitate further analysis by tandem_mass ms_ms the main technology for high_throughput neuropeptide identification many neuropeptides are difficult to identify when searching ms_ms against large protein databases because of their atypical lengths e g shorter longer than common tryptic_peptides and lack of tryptic residues to facilitate peptide ionization fragmentation neuropedia is a neuropeptide encyclopedia of peptide_sequences including genomic and taxonomic information and spectral_libraries of identified ms_ms of homolog neuropeptides from multiple species searching neuropeptide ms_ms data against known neuropedia sequences will improve the sensitivity of database_search moreover the availability of neuropeptide spectral_libraries will also enable the utilization of spectral_library tools which are known to further improve the sensitivity of peptide_identification these will also reinforce the confidence in peptide_identifications by enabling visual comparisons between new and previously_identified neuropeptide ms_ms neuropeptides are peptide neurotransmitters and hormones that mediate cellcell communication for regulation of physiological_functions and biological_processes understanding the role and regulation of neuropeptide forms in health disease and drug_treatments requires the ability to globally analyze neuropeptide expression in an unbiased form mass_spectrometry ms based neuropeptidomics is highly suited for untargeted global neuropeptides studies however the unique characteristics of neuropeptides e g short long_sequences or nontryptic presents difficulties for identification from tandem_mass ms_ms with popular database_search such as sequest and mascot for to whom correspondence should be addressed example short neuropeptides can lead to inaccurate search results because the database_search usually assign lower scores to short_peptides conversely long or nontryptic neuropeptides are difficult to identify because most database_search are trained for tryptic_peptides cleaved at k r and because peptide fragmentation processes for long neuropeptides is usually not efficient in addition searching larger databases takes more time because of the number of comparisons and reduces the number of resulting identifications by allowing more choices for false_positives therefore while some neuropeptides can be identified with current bioinformatics approaches complete neuropeptidomics will require the design of novel computational_tools for identifying both short and longer neuropeptides using tandem_mass the online neuropeptide repository at www neuropeptides nl provides non searchable neuropeptide sequences gene names precursor names and expected expression in the human_brain it also offers hyperlinks to bioinformatics databases on genomes transcripts protein_structure and brain expression unfortunately this resource is not designed to enable identification from ms_ms data users must search their data using other peptide database_search and later compare the results against the neuropeptide list this process is much less sensitive and requires time consuming manual matching of search results to information in existing resources neuropedia is a specialized neuropeptide database and spectral library that is directly searchable using mass_spectrometry data in addition to the expected improvement in sensitivity from searching against a small targeted sequence database the neuropeptide spectral_libraries further improve identification efficiency sensitivity and reliability by considering all spectral_features including actual fragment intensities neutral losses from fragments and various uncommon or even unknown fragments to determine the best matches neuropedia spectral_libraries are compatible with the publicly_available spectral_library tool m split and can be easily converted to other spectral library formats to further facilitate visual_evaluation of neuropeptide ms_ms neuropedia provides annotated spectrum images for every library spectrum and further separates spectral_libraries by species digestion enzyme and instrument type see supplementary table the neuropedia spectral library contains a total of identified spectra in mgf files as described in supplementaryin addition to providing libraries for all identified spectra neuropedia also contains libraries of manually validated high lowquality spectra for unique combinations of peptide_sequence and precursor charge states the neuropedia sequence database contains neuropeptides from human chimpanzee mouse rat cow california sea hare rhesus_macaque and medicinal leech using inspect or any other database_search tool new ms_ms data can be searched against this sequence database as shown in total uniprot in supplementary table searching against neuropedia identifies many more spectra than the uniprot database out of all possible pairs of neuropeptides sequences without considering species there are pairs with identical_sequences type a pairs with overlapping sequences type b and pairs with homolog sequences type c a detailed_description of the format of the databases is provided in supplementary_materials
