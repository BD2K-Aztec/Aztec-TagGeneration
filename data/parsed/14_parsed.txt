a bayesian_approach for structure_learning in oscillating regulatory_networks motivation oscillations lie at the core of many biological_processes from the cell_cycle to circadian_oscillations and developmental_processes time keeping mechanisms are essential to enable organisms to adapt to varying conditions in environmental cycles from day night to seasonal transcriptional_regulatory are one of the mechanisms behind these biological oscillations however while identifying cyclically expressed genes from time series measurements is relatively easy determining the structure of the interaction_network underpinning the oscillation is a far more challenging_problem results here we explicitly leverage the oscillatory nature of the transcriptional signals and present a method for reconstructing network interactions tailored to this special but important class of genetic_circuits our method is based on projecting the signal onto a set of oscillatory basis_functions using a discrete_fourier we build a bayesian_hierarchical within a frequency_domain linear_model in order to enforce sparsity and incorporate_prior about the network_structure experiments on real and simulated_data show that the method can lead to substantial improvements over competing approaches if the oscillatory assumption is met and remains competitive also in cases it is not availability dss experiment scripts and data are available at http homepages inf ed ac uk gsan guin dss zip cyclic behaviour is ubiquitous in biology the importance of oscillatory systems stems both from the necessity to adapt to the many environmental cycles circadian annual etc as well as to maintain intrinsically periodic processes such as the cell_cycle both of these type of oscillations are essential to many physiological_processes and malfunctions in the cellular time keeping mechanisms are frequently associated with disease further motivating the study of these systems genetic_regulatory are at the core of many of these biological oscillators these networks can sustain oscillatory behaviour in protein levels through specific architectures involving multiple feedback_loops of transcriptional_regulation for example a transcriptional oscillator is thought to drive the arabidopsis_thaliana circadian_clock through mutual repression of three transcriptional_regulators the cell_cycle is another oscillatory process which controls cell_division and duplication in the case of saccharomyces_cerevisiae experiments and dynamical_models suggest that the cell_cycle is the result of a transition between two self maintaining steady_states driven by two antagonistic classes of proteins evidence suggests that a transcriptional_network is an important v c the author published_by in this section we assess the performance of our method on two realistic simulated_datasets and a real_dataset comparing its performance to two other state of the art methods we call our method dss for dft based spike and slab model the first simulated dataset was generated from a well known model for the a thaliana circadian_clock network this model is a non linear ordinary_differential ode based model which exhibits regular oscillations for suitable parametrisations thus matching one of our main modelling assumptions however it is a non linear_model hence introducing an element of model mismatch as a second synthetic benchmark_dataset we used one of the datasets provided by the dream_challenge this is again a non linear_model which exhibits damped oscillatory dynamics in some of the nodes thus this dataset presents considerably more elements of model mismatch the last experiment_tested the method on a real_dataset of gene_expression levels obtained in a micro array experiment for the saccharomyces_cerevisiae cell_cycle transcriptional_network results were assessed in terms of area under the precision_recall aupr curve pr curves plot the fraction of correctly called instances versus the ratio of true_positives over true_positives plus false_negatives an ideal classifier would give a aupr of while a random baseline would return the ratio of positives negatives inference of the models parameters was conducted by gibbs_sampling from the model presented in in total samples were obtained the last samples were selected and averaged to compute the conditional_probability of a link p h ij j given the model and the expression data see supplementary_information sections and for details into the inputs and outputs of the program
