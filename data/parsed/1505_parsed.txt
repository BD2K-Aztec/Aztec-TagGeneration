gene_expression dvd an r cytoscape pipeline for drug_repurposing using public_repositories of gene_expression data multiple methods based on matching gene_expression have been proposed to identify anti correlated drug and disease profiles the central paradigm is that a drug compound which shows the opposite effect on gene_expression to the observed for a disease could be used to treat that particular disease these methods have resulted in hypotheses of differential uses repurposing for existing compounds that have been validated experimentally this highlights the potential power of mining existing safe compounds for repurposing which does not require the expensive and extensive initial design and clinical phases of drug_discovery it is expected that analysing new and existing data from public_repositories such as array express www ebi ac uk arrayexpress gene_expression geo www ncbi nlm nih gov geo and the connectivity_map cmap www broadinstitute org cmap using these methods will become increasingly popular in computational drug_discovery motivated by this we have developed drug versus disease dvd an r package to match drug and disease profiles this is done by making use of gene_set and visualizing the final results in networks containing clusters of similar drugs and diseases dvd differs from existing web_servers and databases such as profilechaser marq and spied see_supplementary in that it can dynamically access both array express and geo to generate input profiles with dvd users can automatically compare input profiles to reference_drug data from cmap and disease profiles curated from geo this reference data has associated networks where unlike similar tools drugs or diseases exerting similar effects on transcription are grouped into clusters dvd is flexible offering customizable and default data options for the input profiles and the reference data the cytoscape www cytoscape org plug in provides a user_interface to the full dvd pipeline as well as a visualization platform for the results in the final networks drug or disease nodes are linked to the drugbank www drugbank ca and medical_subject mesh www ncbi nlm nih gov mesh web_browsers respectively to illustrate the use of dvd in drug_repurposing we analysed several disease datasets available from geo we compared them with the compounds in the cmap using dvd and considered significant those connections with q value a prostate_cancer profile gse had seven significant matches with five being negative the strongest negative correlation was with estradiol a known treatment for prostate_cancer for a breast_cancer profile gse we found the third highest inverse_correlation with tamoxifen a similarly well known treatment for breast_cancer the compound scoring highest was ranitidine a histamine receptor type h antagonist which has previously analysed as a potential treatment for breast_cancer finally we analysed a type_ii profile gse and found phenformin and torasemide at the seventh and ninth highest therapeutic scores respectively interestingly finasteride scored higher than both of these known treatments for type_ii with the third strongest negative correlation finasteride inhibits the type alphareductase enzyme which converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone testosterone is known to be important in glucose_homeostasis and lipid_metabolism these results were not obtained when analysing these three profiles using cmap supplementary_material showing the value in combining replicate experiments to generate profiles for comparison
