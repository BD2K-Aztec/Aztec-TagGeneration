active_site prediction using evolutionary and structural_information motivation the identification of catalytic_residues is a key_step in understanding the function of enzymes while a variety of computational_methods have been developed for this task accuracies have remained fairly low the best existing method exploits information from sequence and structure to achieve a precision the fraction of predicted catalytic_residues that are catalytic of at a corresponding recall the fraction of catalytic_residues identified of on a standard benchmark here we present a new method discern which provides a significant_improvement over the state of the art through the use of statistical_techniques to derive a model with a small set of features that are jointly predictive of enzyme active_sites results in cross_validation experiments on two benchmark_datasets from the catalytic_site atlas and catres resources containing a total of manually_curated enzymes spanning scop families discern increases catalytic_site recall between and over methods that combine_information from both sequence and structure and by over methods that make use of sequence_conservation signal only controlled experiments show that discerns improvement in catalytic residue prediction is derived from the combination of three ingredients the use of the intrepid phylogenomic method to extract conservation information the use of d structure data including features computed for residues that are proximal in the structure and a statistical regularization procedure to prevent overfitting the prediction of protein_function from limited data is an important challenge in the post genomic era bioinformatics_methods that provide_clues to the roles of individual_residues in a protein are used by biologists to prioritize site_directed experiments and to provide a more specific prediction of function than simple homology based_approaches in this work to whom correspondence should be addressed we focus on the task of predicting catalytic_residues in enzymes using information from sequence and structure the earliest methods for catalytic residue prediction relied on detecting conservation patterns across a family followed by increasingly powerful sequence_based scoring_functions methods relying exclusively on information from solved d structures have been developed analyzing features such as the geometric arrangements of residues surface geometry electrostatics energetics and chemical_properties other methods combine features derived from sequence and structure or use sequence_data in combination with predicted structure features to improve accuracy in this article we present a new method for predicting catalytic_residues which we have named discern discern is a statistical predictor that achieves a significant_improvement in performance over other catalytic residue prediction_methods previously the best recall the fraction of true catalytic_residues that are predicted to be catalytic reported on homology reduced datasets is at a precision the fraction of predicted catalytic_residues that are indeed catalytic of in comparison at the same precision discern yields a recall of at least representing an improvement of in recall over the best current methods for this task in this section we report results of large_scale experiments on manually_curated enzymes from the csa andpage in this article we have described a new approach to the prediction of active_sites in proteins our results on benchmark_datasets of manually_curated enzymes from the csa and catres resources show that discern provides a significant_improvement over the best methods that make use of information from sequence and or structure to predict catalytic_sites discern is a statistical predictor that brings together three important ideas the combination of which are needed in order to obtain the striking improvements in accuracy shown here first discern uses an evolutionary modeling_approach specifically the intrepid phylogenomic method to infer the degree to which residues are under selective_pressure second we incorporate page
