systems_biology pathvisio mim pathvisio plugin for creating and editing molecular_interaction maps mims motivation a plugin for the java_based pathvisio pathway editor has been developed to help users draw diagrams of bioregulatory networks according to the molecular_interaction map mim notation together with the core pathvisio application this plugin presents a simple to use and cross_platform application for the construction of complex mim diagrams with the ability to annotate diagram elements with comments literature references and links to external databases this tool extends the capabilities of the pathvisio pathway editor by providing both mim specific glyphs and support for a mim specific markup_language file_format for exchange with other mim compatible tools and diagram validation availability the pathvisio mim plugin is freely_available and works with versions of pathvisio and later on windows mac os x and linux information about mim notation and the mimml format is available at http discover nci nih gov mim the plugin along with diagram examples instructions and java source_code may be downloaded at http discover nci nih gov mim mim pathvisio html understanding biological_pathways requires knowledge of both the biological_components of a pathway and the interactions between its components improvements in molecular_biology techniques have fueled a surge in this type of information this has made the organization of biological_knowledge along with consistent mechanisms for how this information is exchanged among researchers of utmost_importance one of the most common means of relating information about biological_pathways is through the use of pathway diagrams which are oftentimes more natural to readers the molecular_interaction map mim notation is a graphical notation for depicting diagrams of biochemical and cellular_processes designed to alleviate ambiguity that exists in many diagrams currently found in publications mim diagrams are similar tothe pathvisio mim plugin helps biologists draw diagrams in accordance with the mim notation this combined with the many features of pathvisio will aid in making the mim notation accessible to a wider audience to encourage usage of this software and the notation by first time users we provide example files written documentation and instructional videos on the project_web the plugin takes_advantage of the extensible nature of pathvisio to provide support of all the major features of the mim notation and may serve as an example for mim support in other software code additions that were made in the core pathvisio editor should facilitate the support of other notations in pathvisio such as the systems_biology sbgn or the modified edinburgh pathway notation support for the sbgn notation is currently in development via a separate plugin support for these notations or other notations within the same software_tool presents a basis for translating diagrams between notations future development of the plugin is expected as additions are made to the mim specification also we expect the addition of validation support in pathvisio for rulesets such as the one developed for mimml
