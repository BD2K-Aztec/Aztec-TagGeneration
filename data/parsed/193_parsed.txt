a knowledge based_approach for predicting gene_disease motivation recent_advances of next generation sequence technologies have made it possible to rapidly and inexpensively identify gene variations knowing the disease association of these gene variations is important for early_intervention to treat deadly diseases and provide possible targets to cure these diseases genome_wide gwas have identified many individual genes associated with common diseases to exploit the large amount of data obtained from gwas_studies and leverage our understanding of common as well as rare_diseases we have developed a knowledge based_approach to predict genedisease_associations we first derive genegene mutual_information by utilizing the cooccurrence of genes in known genedisease association data subsequently the mutual_information is combined with known proteinprotein_interaction by a boosted tree regression_method results the method called know gene is compared with the method of random walking on the heterogeneous network using the same input_data for a set of diseases using the same training data in testing in fold_cross the average recall_rate within the top_ranked genes by know gene is compared with by the state of the art random walking on heterogeneous network this significant_improvement is mostly due to the inclusion of knowledge based mutual_information availability_and predictions for genes associated with the diseases are available atcomplex diseases such as parkinsons disease pd are attributed to both genetic and or environmental causes environmental toxins cause disease through their effects on genes knowing the genes associated with a disease is useful for preventing and curing the disease it is also fundamentally_important for understanding the biological_functions of genes genome_wide gwas posit that multiple common small risk_variants interact to cause common diseases gwas relies on testing several hundred thousand common_genetic found throughout the human_genome in large control cohorts over the past_few many gene_loci have been implicated as associated with various human_diseases by gwas www genome gov gwastudies as well as linkage_studies despite the fruitful insights provided by gwas heritability_estimates have shown that large_proportions of genetic_risk underlying complex disease have not yet been explained this is due to lack of the ability to detect common disease by rare_variants using a gwas approach the introduction of nextgeneration_sequencing allows cost_effective sequencing of entire genomes and has led to the discovery of numerous rare_variants in the human_genome the disease associations of these rare_variants cannot be inferred by gwas for further experimental_verification thus alternative computational_methods that predict the association of gene with a given disease have been developed v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com the general idea of prediction_methods is the guilt by association principle with respect to a set of known genes related to the given disease the most frequently used types of evidence for inference of association are i text_mining of the biomedical_literature ii phenotype relationships such as diseasedisease similarity iii proteinprotein_interactions iv regulatory information and v gene_expression information for example vanused a text_mining approach to associate genes with human phenotypes found in the online_mendelian omim database k hler et_al found genedisease_associations by using a global network distance measurea random_walk analysisfor the definition of similarities in proteinprotein_interaction the interactome encouragingly they find that this approach significantly_outperforms previous methods based on local distance measures in the interactome a slightly modified approach_called network propagation that differs from a random_walk only in the normalization of the adjacency_matrix w representing the interactome has also been developed the random_walk method normalizes the adjacency_matrix w by columns the summation of each column equals to one whereas the network propagation normalizes w by the diagonal matrix w ij w ij ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi d i i d j j p where d i k p k w ik an extension of the random_walk approach is walking on a heterogeneous network that includes proteinprotein_interaction diseasedisease and genedisease networks singhhave developed a truncated version of the random walking on a heterogeneous network by using a limited steps for the walks but it also includes phenotypes from multiple species the method uses simple dampening coefficients for longer walks and learns the coefficients for longer walks using a support_vector svm natarajan and dhillon developed an inductive method that uses a machine_learning approach to incorporate different biological_sources of evidence such as microarray_expression gene functional interaction data and disease related textual data from human as well as other species the best performing of the aforementioned methods for prioritizing genes associated with a given disease is the inductive matrix completion developed by natarajan and dhillon it has an average recall_rate of within the top_ranked genes there are also many disease specific methods that focus on a single or group of diseases to prioritize genes for further experimental_validation for a survey of methods for predicting genedisease association please see piro and di cunto here we develop a new type of approach for prioritizing candidate_genes associated with a given disease our approach applies the idea of word association in the context of texts to genegene association in the context of diseases and then employs genegene association to infer genedisease association this is a knowledge based_approach that learns genegene association propensity in diseases from known genedisease association it is also analogous to methods of knowledge based statistical_potentials for protein_structure that learn residueresidue or atomatom pairwise interaction potentials from experimental protein_structures mutual_information is used to measure the strength of genegene association in a given disease owing to the increasing amount of data for known genedisease_associations the mutual_information of genegene pairs can be derived from these known associations subsequently mutual_information is combined with the properties of the proteinprotein physical interaction_network by means of boosted tree regression the resulting method called know gene is then benchmarked in fold crossvalidation training on of the known genedisease_associations and testing on the remaining and compared with network propagation random walking on the interactome as well as on the heterogeneous network based_methods for diseases defined by the medical_subject meshs ontology with at least two known seed genes associated with a given disease as provided by the omim and gwas databases using the same input evidence known genedisease association and interactome know gene achieves a significantly better recall_rate within the top_ranked of total screened genes compared with the network propagation the random_walk on interactome and the random_walk on heterogeneous network methods thus know gene is a promising method for prioritizing candidate_genes associated with a given disease then we apply know gene in prediction mode training on all known genedisease_associations to predict and rank genes in the human exome for each of the diseases likewise our predictions can rank diseases for a given gene a useful feature for diagnosing diseases in a given mutated gene it is also useful for predicting and understanding possible side_effects of drug_targets predictions are available for academic users at http cssb biology gatech edu knowgene we have developed a knowledge based_approach know gene for prioritizing genes associated with given disease likewise it can also prioritize diseases associated with a given gene the novelty of know gene is in the derivation of genegene mutual_information from the cooccurrence frequency of pairs of genes in a large number of diseases with a known set of genedisease_associations with this novel technique know gene performs much better than the best existing method of walking on the heterogeneous network using exactly the same input information recall_rate within top_ranked genes versus both know gene and walking on the heterogeneous network utilize information from the known genedisease_associations and perform much better than methods without using this information for example the network propagation method has a recall_rate of which is about half that by the method of random_walk on the heterogeneous network all tested methods perform better for diseases having core genes than thap human support thap gene is part of a family of thap proteins that bind specific dna_sequences and regulate cell_proliferation through the prb e f cell_cycle target_genes a pathway recently_proposed to be involved in cell_death in pd for those lacking core genes when used for prioritizing diseases for a given gene know gene has an average recall_rate of a disadvantage of know gene as well as the method of walking on the heterogeneous network is that it does not perform well for genes that are not present in any of the diseases used in deriving the mutual_information test on singletons in practice for such genes we can choose an alternative method such as knowgene without using mutual_information or the network propagation method possible further improvement of know gene could come from enriching more genes with more verified disease associations and including them in deriving mutual_information these could be fulfilled by literature_searches for associations with high know gene prediction scores and then using the supported associations in training this process could be iterated for those genes without any known disease associations other sources for deriving their mutual_information are sought for example one possibility is the covariation of gene_expression data in individuals with a given disease cooccurrence of gene_pairs in pathways is another possible source these and other alternatives will be explored in future work
