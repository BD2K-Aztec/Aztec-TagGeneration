reverse_engineering of logic_based differential_equation models using a mixed integer dynamic optimization approach_motivation systems_biology models can be used to test new hypotheses formulated on the basis of previous_knowledge or new experimental_data contradictory with a previously existing model new hypotheses often come in the shape of a set of possible regulatory_mechanisms this search is usually not limited to finding a single regulation link but rather a combination of links subject to great uncertainty or no information about the kinetic_parameters results in this work we combine a logic_based formalism to describe all the possible regulatory structures for a given dynamic_model of a pathway with mixed integer dynamic optimization mido this framework aims to simultaneously identify the regulatory structure represented by binary parameters and the real valued parameters that are consistent with the available experimental_data resulting in a logic_based differential_equation model the alternative to this would be to perform real valued parameter_estimation for each possible model structure which is not tract able for models of the size presented in this work the performance of the method presented here is illustrated with several case studies a synthetic_pathway problem of signaling regulation a two component signal_transduction in bacterial homeostasis and a signaling_network in liver cancer_cells in recent_years there has been a growing interest in the application of logic formalisms to systems_biology and in particular to model signal_transduction the basis of this model formalism lies in the assumption that cells process information of certain stimuli approximately by logic circuits and their simplicity makes them particularly amenable to model large_networks and integrate pathway_knowledge from databases with high_throughput data logic models were first introduced byto model gene_regulatory since then diverse modifications from the original formalism were developed in particular various extensions have been developed to accommodate continuous values e g in this contribution we apply a mixed integer global optimization approach to reverse_engineer logic_based ode_models from timecourse data the problem is stated as simultaneously finding the binary variables that determine the model structure and its associated continuous parameters further to improve computational_efficiency we present a relaxed non linear_programming reformulation of the problem that allows us to find good initial points for the mixed integer nonlinear programming problem
