genome_analysis a computational genomics pipeline for prokaryotic sequencing_projects motivation new sequencing_technologies have accelerated research on prokaryotic_genomes and have made genome_sequencing operations outside major genome_sequencing centers routine however no off_the solution exists for the combined assembly gene prediction genome_annotation and data presentation necessary to interpret sequencing_data the resulting requirement to invest significant resources into custom informatics support for genome_sequencing remains a major_impediment to the accessibility of high_throughput sequence_data results we present a self contained automated high_throughput open_source genome_sequencing and computational genomics pipeline suitable for prokaryotic sequencing_projects the pipeline has been used at the georgia institute of technology and the centers_for for the analysis of neisseria_meningitidis and bordetella_bronchiseptica genomes the pipeline is capable of enhanced or manually assisted reference based assembly using multiple assemblers and modes gene predictor combining and functional_annotation of genes and gene_products because every component of the pipeline is executed on a local machine with no need to access resources over the internet the pipeline is suitable for projects of a sensitive nature annotation of virulence related features makes the pipeline particularly useful for projects working with pathogenic prokaryotes genome_sequencing pioneered in the s require large_scale computational support in to whom correspondence should be addressed order to make their data accessible for use and interpretation by biologists large sequencing centers have traditionally employed or collaborated with teams of software engineers and computational_biologists to develop the software and algorithms for sequencing hardware interfaces enterprise data storage sequence_assembly and finishing genome feature prediction and annotation database mining comparative_analysis and database user_interface development while many of the components developed by these teams are now available online under open_access terms the development of new high_throughput has necessitated updates to these tools and development of even more sophisticated algorithms to address the challenges raised by the new data these new technologies pyrosequencing abi solid and illumina are now collectively referred to as second_generation similar updates will be needed as the third generation of sequencing_technologies such as pacific_biosciences smrt_sequencing enter production use new and improved tools released for these technologies on a monthly basis include assemblers mapping algorithms base_calling and error_correction tools and a multitude of other programs because of this fast pace of development few experts are able to keep up with the state of the art in the field of computational genomics accordingly the rate_limiting in genome_sequencing is no longer the experimental_characterization of the data but rather the availability of experts and resources for computational_analysis at the same time the increased affordability of these new sequencing_machines has spawned a new generation of users who were previously unable to perform their own genome_sequencing and thus collaborated with large sequencing centers for genome_sequencing and subsequent computational_analysis while these users are now able to experimentally characterize genomes in house they often find themselves struggling to take full advantage of the resulting data and to make it useful to the scientific_community since the informatics support for their genome_projects is not sufficient several large sequencing consortia have produced comprehensive centralized web_based portals for the analysis of genomic and metagenomic_data while extremely useful for many types of projects and collaborations these solutions inherently result in apage
