proq estimation of model accuracy implemented in rosetta motivation model_quality programs are used to predict the quality of modeled protein_structures they can be divided_into two groups depending on the information they are using ensemble methods using consensus of many alternative_models and methods only using a single model to do its prediction the consensus methods excel in achieving_high correlations between prediction and true quality_measures however they frequently fail to pick out the best possible model nor can they be used to generate and score new structures single model methods on the other hand do not have these inherent shortcomings and can be used both to sample new structures and to improve existing consensus methods results here we present an implementation of the proq program to estimate both local and global model accuracy as part of the rosetta modeling suite the current_implementation does not only make it possible to run large batch runs locally but it also opens up a whole new arena for conformational_sampling using machine learned scoring_functions and to incorporate model accuracy estimation in to various existing modeling schemes proq participated in casp and results from casp are used to benchmark the current_implementation based on results from casp and cameo qe a continuous benchmark of quality estimation methods it is clear that proq is the single model method that performs best in both local and global model accuracy availability_and https github com bjornwallner proq scriptsprotein structure modeling represents a fundamental challenge in structural_bioinformatics and is crucial for a detailed understanding of the biological_function of molecules it can be used to guide and explain experiments as well as for prediction of proteins whose structure for the most part is unknown k known structures vs k known sequences a common technique in structure modeling is to generate many alternative_models and then use a program to estimate the model accuracy to select the best model alternatively the estimated accuracy can also be used to assess the absolute quality of a single model i e a measure that is related to similarity to true native_structure proq is a single model method that estimates model accuracy using a support_vector svm to predict the quality of a protein model by combining structural and sequence_based features calculated from the model the structural based features are contacts between different atom types residue residue_contacts grouping amino_acids into six different groups hydrophobic positively_charged etc and surface_accessibility using the same residue groups the sequence_based features are calculated from information predicted from sequence i e secondary_structure surface v c the author published_by the proq version implemented in rosetta participated in casp with two methods proq and proq refine proq is only using the proq score while proq refine does side chain repacks to calculate the optimal proq score given the current backbone this has previously been shown to improve model_selection by finding good backbones with sub optimal side chain packing based on the official casp assessment and fromit is clear that both proq versions are among the best if not the best single model program to estimate global model accuracy with proq refine being slightly better overall and on the easy targets while voromqa and multicomnovel are better on the hard targets it is interesting that in terms of model_selection the pure clustering_methods are much worse than single model methods in particular for hard targets where the z_score for the pure clustering_methods pcons and davis qaconsensus is almost random rz hard and rz hard compared to the much higher z_score for the best single model methods rz hard for easy targets the clusteringthe summed z_score for the first ranked model selected by each method for all easy and hard targets single model methods in bold pure clustering in italics and the others are using a combination of single model and clustering this method was added after casp as a reference refs q methods still have an advantage over single model method but overall the only methods that are better than the best single model methods are methods that combine the best single model methods with clustering multicom construct is using the multicom single model methods and wallner is using proq together with pcons the latter improved the rz all from to this clearly shows that single model methods are very useful in model_selection in particular in combination with clustering_methods the global quality prediction in proq is actually based on the predicted local error the local error estimates from proq was recently combined with phaser to enable molecular_replacement for more targets and using poorer models clearly demonstrating the added value of local model error prediction for solving crystal_structure by molecular_replacement the local model prediction_accuracy for the casp_targets was assessed using roc_curves with a a cutoff for correct residues here proq is clearly much better than all other single model methods identifying more correct residues compared to the second best wang deep at fpr and over twice as many for the methods that performed equally well or in some cases even better than proq in model_selection there is a similar trend for the cameo data but the margins up to the reference consensus method modfold and best other single model method qmean are smaller for both casp and cameo data there are no noticeable difference between proq and proq refine on the local_level to conclude there is still a performance gap between the singlemodel methods and the consensus methods overall however the single model methods are clearly much better in global model_selection on hard targets and they are also useful in combination with consensus methods demonstrated by the performance of the wallner method which combines pcons and proq finally among the methods benchmarked in casp and cameo proq is currently the single model method that performs best in both global and local model accuracy prediction conflict of interest none declared local model prediction_accuracy for a casp and b cameo for all single model methods and one reference consensus method shown as a dotted line using a as a cutoff for correct residues methods are ordered according to the auc which is also shown next to the method name modfold in cameo runs in quasi single mode which means that the input is a single model and the consensus ensemble is constructed internally
