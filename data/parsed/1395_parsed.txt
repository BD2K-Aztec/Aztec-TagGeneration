direct calculation of minimal_cut involving a specific reaction knock_out motivation the concept of minimal_cut mcss is used in metabolic_network modeling to describe minimal groups of reactions or genes whose simultaneous deletion eliminates the capability of the network to perform a specific task previous work showed that mcss where closely_related to elementary_flux efms in a particular dual problem opening up the possibility to use the tools developed for computing efms to compute mcss until recently however there existed no method to compute an efm with some specific characteristic meaning that in the case of mcss the only strategy to obtain them was to enumerate them using for example the standard k shortest efms algorithm results in this work we adapt the recently_developed theory to compute efms satisfying several constraints to the calculation of mcss involving a specific reaction knockout importantly we emphasize that not all the efms in the dual problem correspond to real mcss and propose a new formulation capable of correctly identifying the mcs wanted furthermore this formulation brings interesting insights about the relationship between the primal and the dual problem of the mcs computation availability_and a matlab cplex implementation of the proposed algorithm is available as a supplementary_material the concept of minimal_cut was introduced in klamt andand refined in mcss were defined as a minimal set of reactions whose removal would render the functioning of a given objective reaction impossible their relationship with elementary_flux and the dualization of the main_problem was mentioned in klamt and formally exploited in with this theoretical breakthrough it became possible to calculate mcss using algorithms designed to calculate efms for example the k shortest efm enumeration algorithm was used to enumerate mcss in von kamp and klamt efficient calculation of efms has been an active area of research in the last years most of the algorithms have focused the attention on calculating as many efms as possible however one may only be interested in some efms that fulfill some constraints while in theory a valid_approach would be to calculate all the efms and then filter them according to the desired criteria in practice it is currently impossible in large_networks as the number of efms grows exponentially with network size it is this question that was addressed in a recent paper by where a mixed_integer milp formulation was introduced to directly calculate efms satisfying a desired set of constraints for example an efm containing several reactions of interest can be now directly calculated for the metabolic modeling community it will be very valuable to directly calculate mcss of certain characteristics for instance a mcs involving a specific reaction knock_out can be used to determine if it is possible to couple growth with the synthesis of a specific product in fact strain design for the optimization of chemical production such as biofuels is one of the main applications of mcss it is not necessary to solve a mcs problem to know if the production of a chemical is coupled to growth but in case it is not a mcs suggests the modifications necessary to make the coupling a reality another possible application of mcss in the field of human_health involves finding a complementary target to an already druggable reaction here mcss would be viewed as synthetic lethals for treating_cancer or other diseases in this work we adapt the formulation in pey and planes to achieve_this in the process we stress that not all the efms in the dual problem correspond to correct mcss of the original network which implies that not all the algorithms designed for the calculation of efms can be directly applied to the calculation of mcss without careful_consideration the modifications made to the algorithm in pey and planes are mathematically justified and bring interesting insights between the primal and the dual problem of the mcs computation in this section we first introduce a toy example where it can be seen that not every efm in the dual network corresponds to a mcs in the primal network and check that our algorithm is capable of correctly identifying mcss for each reaction then we apply our algorithm to two networks of different sizes namely the e coli core metabolic_network and the iaf e coli model comparing the behaviour of our algorithm with that of the enumeration approach presented in von kamp and klamt the model was implemented in matlab using cplex as the underlying optimization software and can be found in supplementary_material ii the computations were carried_out on a bit intel_xeon e v at ghz cores and gb of ram shows a primal toy network and the dual network arising from its corresponding mcs problem this network has only one reversible reaction r and we will consider r as the target reaction
