uss a web_server for detecting alternative utrs from rna_seq experiments protein_coding with multiple alternative polyadenylation_sites can generate mrna utr sequences of different lengths thereby causing the loss or gain of regulatory_elements which can affect stability localization and translation efficiency uss is a web_server developed with the aim of giving experimentalists the possibility to automatically identify alternative utrs shorter or longer with respect to a reference transcriptome an option that is not available in standard rna_seq procedures the tool reports as putative novel the utrs not annotated in available databases furthermore if data from two related samples are uploaded common and specific alternative utrs are identified and reported by the server the untranslated_regions utrs of mrnas play_a in post_transcriptional in fact they contain cis_regulatory such as au rich elements are microrna binding_sites etc which can affect transcript stability degradation subcellular_localization and translation through alternative_polyadenylation a widespread mechanism in eukaryotic_organisms different isoforms of the same gene can acquire alternative longer or shorter untranslated_regions the phenomenon seems to be different in different tissues during development and recently it has also been observed in cancer_cells with the emergence of next_generation it is now possible to sequence entire transcriptomes in one experiment in standard rna_seq protocols the reconstructed transcripts are compared with an annotated reference transcriptome the most commonly used methods e g cuffcompare and cuffmerge distinguish known from putative novel isoforms but they rely on the comparison of the intronic structure of the transcripts thereby do not take into account reads that might support the existence of alternative utrs and therefore the existence of putative novel transcripts with different utr is not reported to the user the great interest for these important regulatory_regions is leading to the development of more sophisticated rna_sequencing library_preparation protocols the more powerful will be the possibility to entirely sequence the untranslated_region the more accurate will the reconstruction of putative novel utrs be at the same time different computational_tools to captureeach assembled transcript is processed by selecting the isoforms sharing the same intron chain of known protein_coding transcripts in the reference the reconstructed utrs are consequently identified as the regions located immediately after the stop_codon and can be directly compared detecting possible differences in their utr lengths the alternative utrs are then compared with already annotated ones in other databases the latest available data from igenomes http cufflinks cbcb umd edu igenomes html and gencode to identify putative novel not yet annotated utrs the most informative output_files that the uss server produces are a fasta file with the alternative utr nucleotide_sequences and other information in their headers gene id coding strand utr genomic_coordinates and length a list of the transcripts with their utr length difference and a list of the alternative not yet annotated utrs putative novel in other databases as well as the annotated ones the user can also easily visualize the transcripts in a graphical environment through the ucsc_genome in the supplementary_material if an already annotated transcriptome is uploaded as input the utr sequences and genomic_coordinates of all the protein_coding transcripts are returned if the user submits input_files derived from two different related rna_seq experiments the uss server compares the alternative utrs reporting how they are distributed across the two biological_samples each transcript with an alternative utr is associated to its assembled transcript id e g tcons x for cufflinks transcriptome_assembly files and through it to all the corresponding analysis results so that useful information read_coverage expression abundance etc can be directly retrieved from the complete rna_seq results
