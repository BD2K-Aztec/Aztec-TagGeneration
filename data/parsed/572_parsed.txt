atsnp transcription_factor binding_affinity testing for regulatory snp_detection motivation genome_wide revealed that most disease associated single_nucleotide snps are located in regulatory_regions within introns or in regions between genes regulatory snps rsnps are such snps that affect gene_regulation by changing transcription_factor tf binding_affinities to genomic_sequences identifying potential rsnps is crucial for understanding disease mechanisms in silico methods that evaluate the impact of snps on tf binding_affinities are not scalable for large_scale analysis results we describe affinity testing for regulatory snps atsnp a computationally_efficient r package for identifying rsnps in silico atsnp implements an importance sampling algorithm coupled with a first order markov_model for the background nucleotide_sequences to test the significance of affinity scores and snp driven changes in these scores application of atsnp with k snps indicates that atsnp is the only available tool for such a large_scale task atsnp provides user_friendly output in the form of both tables and composite logo plots for visualizing snp motif interactions evaluations of atsnp with known rsnp tf interactions indicate that atsnp is able to prioritize motifs for a given set of snps with high_accuracy availability_and https genome_wide have been instrumental in identifying single_nucleotide snps associated with large_numbers of phenotypes the vast_majority of association snps are in non coding_regions suggesting that they may have regulatory_roles in deriving the phenotype in particular regulatory snps which alter binding_affinity of transcription_factors and affect_gene constitute an important class of such snps a standard in silico approach for identifying rsnps is by evaluating how the snp driven nucleotide_change impacts binding_affinity of tfs to the region_surrounding the snp specifically the dna_sequences around each snp are scored against a library of tf motifs with both the reference and the snp alleles using position_weight pwms of the motifs snps with significantly different scores between the reference and snp alleles are then hypothesized as rsnps we describe atsnp an r package that carries out the following tasks for every snp motif combination of the input_data after extracting genome_sequences of small windows bps around the snp positions i computing affinity scores for both alleles ii statistical_testing for allele specific affinity scores iii statistical_testing for changes in affinity scores between alleles a few existing_tools can perform various subsets of these tasks the most distinctive_feature of atsnp is its ability to accommodate large_scale analysis e g over k snps is rsnp has the most similar functionality to atsnp however is rsnp both and can onlyanalyze at most snps at a time similarly trap takes as input only one snp although rsnp mapper can take as input larger number of snps it lacks critical calculations such as the significance of snp driven affinity change fimo is not designed for evaluating snp impact on affinity scores however it enables p value computation for affinity scores and can be used to compare scores under different alleles however due to computational reasons fimo can only accommodate outputting results thresholded by a small prespecified significance_level for large snp sets in our hands with a amd opteron ghz processor a fimo run for snps against a single pwm without thresholding could not finish within hours whereas atsnp required less than minutes the main computational_burden of both fimo and is rsnp is the computation of the exact p values by enumerating all possible sequences and computing their scores under the null_hypothesis atsnp utilizes an importance sampling technique to overcome this challenge supplementary_materials
