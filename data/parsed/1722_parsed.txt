bioimage_informatics extracting d cell parameters from dense tissue environments application to the development of the mouse_heart motivation in developmental_biology quantitative tools to extract features from fluorescence microscopy_images are becoming essential to characterize organ morphogenesis at the cellular_level however automated_image in this context is a challenging_task owing to perturbations induced by the acquisition process especially in organisms where the tissue is dense and opaque results we propose an automated framework for the segmentation of d microscopy_images of highly cluttered environments such as developing tissues the approach is based on a partial_differential framework that jointly takes_advantage of the nuclear and cellular_membrane information to enable accurate extraction of nuclei and cells in dense tissues this framework has been used to study the developing mouse_heart allowing the extraction of quantitative information such as the cell_cycle duration the method also provides qualitative information on cell_division and cell_polarity through the creation of d orientation maps that provide novel insight into tissue organization during organogenesis availability the proposed_framework is free open_source and available on the icy platform http www icy bioimageanalysis org the advent of modern d optical imaging_techniques has impacted numerous areas of life_sciences giving novel insight into various aspects of cell_behavior notably during tissue development typical images are obtained by labeling the cell_membrane and nuclear_dna with fluorescent_dyes yielding two channel image volumes where cells appear as a dense matrix of contiguous surfaces while nuclei appear as pseudo elliptic blobs in close_vicinity cf however in the context of dense tissues d microscopy_images of developing tissues still suffer from rather poor spatial_resolution in the axial direction analysis is therefore still restricted to the upper section typically microns of the specimen beyond which substantial light_scattering occurs in non transparent tissues thus hindering precise segmentation at the nuclear and cellular_level this is especially true in models such as the mouse where the tissue is much less transparent than that of zebrafish or drosophila alternative solutions have been proposed to improve the imaging process by combining complementary enhancements in the biology and the optics fields for example in transgenic quail lines were generated where only endothelial_cells express a fluorescent marker thus simplifying the quantification of multi_cellular movements in an embryo that is amenable to live_imaging but without real improvement of the resolution a promising solution certainly lies in recent advanced_imaging setups such as single plane illumination microscopy or spim there only a thin sample plane is illuminated while the light emitted by the entire plane is collected at once in the normal direction thereby reducing exposure time bleaching and toxicity such systems are however not or only recently commercially_available although open_access prototypes are currently being developed it is also not clear whether spim images suffer from distortion resolution problems due in particular to the registration and stitching of multi view images in this context and with the exponential_increase in imaging datasets produced digital_image and analysis tools have become indispensible to make the most of d imaging_techniques and data for biological_applications to quantify and then understand the mechanisms_governing morphogenesis and organogenesis quantitative_measures such as cell_cycle durations or cell orientations must be revisited if one wants to make full use of d stacks of the sample until recent_years extraction of cell parameters for the characterization of tissue growth has been limited to d or multi d analysis or limited by the subjectivity and time constraints of manual intervention for d analysis because d cell_behavior is not stereotyped analyses over a large number of d samples are required to extract relevant statistics hence systematic analysis of developing tissues composed of several thousands of cells calls for robust and automated tools to to whom correspondence should be addressed ythe authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as segment cells nuclei and other subcellular structures from d fluorescence_images a substantial amount of research in the image_processing field is dedicated to the problem of multi_cellular segmentation in d in particular recent attempts have been reported to tackle the problem of dense tissue analysis in d these contributions can be declined in two families image filtering approaches aiming to remove the imaging artifacts by reducing the noise smoothing heterogeneous structures and enhancing the contrast segmentation techniques aiming to extract nuclei or cells individually either by means of the watershed transform or via energy minimizing deformable models while watershed based_approaches usually suffer from noise and over segmentation issues deformable models offer a more flexible_approach by allowing the incorporation of image and geometry based information into a robust mathematical framework based on partial_differential pde for instance in the cell_membrane signal is first denoised using a geodesic curvature filter then a generalized d hough_transform approach is used on the nuclear channel to estimate the location of the nuclei finally a subjective surface based technique is used to segment the cell_membranes such an approach yields promising results however it is restricted to the upper section of the specimen illustrating the difficulty of processing deeper slices of the tissue despite the transparency of the zebrafish as compared with the mouse also the cellular and nuclear fluorescence signals are processed separately which may impair the extraction performance the present work introduces a new and alternative pde based framework to automatically denoise and jointly segment nuclei and cells from d images of dense and opaque tissues and to extract quantitative_measures including proliferation rates and cell orientations we propose that combining the nuclear and cellular fluorescence information can significantly improve segmentation of both signals even in highly non transparent tissue such as that of mouse we first use a filtering technique specifically_designed to enhance the cellular_membrane signal and then subtract this signal from the nuclear signal to separate touching nuclei thus improving their detection finally we develop a two step deformable model approach to i segment the nuclei starting from their initial detection using local region homogeneity and ii segment the cells starting from the extracted nuclei using dual region edge information from the filtered membrane signal we use the proposed approach to study the development of the mouse_heart and provide new quantitative_parameters characterizing the morphogenetic process e g number of cells and divisions duration of the cell_cycle as well as d orientation maps to facilitate visual_inspection and enable further statistical and geometrical analysis of the observed tissue quantitative and qualitative evaluations are provided indicating a substantial gain in performance and analysis time compared with current approaches while this work has been tailored for imaging data produced via standard confocal microscopy_techniques we believe the proposed approach is directly amenable to larger samples with future imaging systems and will be of great value when studying tissues with complex geometry in the described workflow the major source of segmentation error is the low_intensity in deep tissue_sections one of the direct consequences is that the nucleus pre detection step is not always able to capture the nucleus as a whole notably due to the heterogeneous labeling therefore yielding more than one object per nucleus and hence over segmentation this problem is also described for watershed based processes and solutions to reduce such artifacts using prior_knowledge are currently in development on a similar note we stress that the proposed workflow enforces a strong semantic relation between the segmentation of the nuclei and that of the cells based on the assumption that cells are mono nucleated while this assumption holds for the current development stage of the observed tissue analysis at later stages of development with the appearance of multi nucleated_cells would require similar care to ensure that a single_cell can be extracted from a subset of detected nuclei we have presented a comprehensive framework for automatic extraction of nuclei and cells from dense and highly cluttered environments in d microscopy of biological_tissue the proposed_framework combines a number of robust pde derived approaches that jointly exploit nucleus and cell fluorescence information and provides an efficient toolset for robust quantification of complex features the approach was applied to study the developing mouse_heart and was validated on three different applications illustrating how developmental_biology can benefit from computational_approaches to facilitate the understanding of tissue development and morphogenesis
