sequence_analysis patterncnv a versatile_tool for detecting copy_number changes from exome sequencing_data exome_sequencing exome seq data which are typically used for calling exonic mutations have also been utilized in detecting dna copy_number cnvs despite the existence of several cnv detection_tools there is still a great need for a sensitive and an accurate cnv_calling algorithm with built in qc steps and does not require a paired reference for each sample results we developed a novel method_named patterncnv which i accounts for the read_coverage variations between exons while lever aging the consistencies of this variability across different samples ii reduces alignment bam_files to wig format and therefore greatly accelerates computation iii incorporates multiple qc measures designed to identify outlier samples and batch_effects and iv provides a variety of visualization options including chromosome gene and exon level views of cnvs along with a tabular summarization of the exon level cnvs compared with other cnv_calling algorithms using data from a lymphoma exome seq study patterncnv has higher sensitivity_and availability_and the software for patterncnv is implemented using perl and r and can be used in mac or linux environments software and user_manual are available at http bioinformaticstools mayo edu research patterncnv and r package at https github com topsoil patterncnv dna copy_number cnvs are genomic structural changes that result in regional or chromosomal loss or gain of dna_copies owing to the significant roles in human_diseases various laboratory_techniques have been developed to detect_cnvs including recently advanced massive_parallel of whole genomes and coding exomes for exome seq it is commonly observed that coverage depths of short_reads across regions vary caused by different target capture efficiencies as well as the differences in mappability of exons such coverage variations impose substantial challenges for reliable cnv_detection most existing_methods use a paired sample approach based on the intuitive assumption that somatic sample and its paired reference share similar coverage bias that can be cancelled out through pairing although this assumption approximately holds it oversimplifies the problem with two limitations unaddressed i the region specific noise coverage variability of a local region is not accounted for leading to amplified noise in log_ratio values of coverage between sample and the paired reference ii in the case of a missing or low quality reference_sample cnv_detection based on paired reference will be infeasible or have degraded accuracy sensitivity a recent published method fishingcnv tried to address the second limitation by using the average of multiple reference samples as the denominators in log_ratio calculation but did not address the regional noises in individual samples the numerator which led to false cnv_calls details in supplementary section s considering these issues we proposed a novel method called patterncnv which summarizes overall consistent_patterns of both depths and variability of exonic region coverage across samples where patterns of coverage and variability are summarized using multiple normal or reference samples we observed that the same patterns only exist between samples prepared using the same version of exome_capture kit during cnv_detection we compute the differences of observed coverage versus the common pattern while penalizing regions associated with larger variability using a weighting_scheme further wholegenome cnv can be interpolated from exon level cnv using any third_party segmentation_method e g circular_binary the patterncnv was implemented in two different versions a mac and linux unix version and an r package version we also developed a conversion tool to transform binary version to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons http creativecommons org_licenses which permits non commercial re use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com of sequence_alignment bam format files to much smaller wiggle wig format files of bam_file size which greatly speeds up pattern learning and cnv calculation when compared with other state of the art cnv algorithms in a lymphoma case study patterncnv displayed higher_resolution and greater sensitivity_specificity
