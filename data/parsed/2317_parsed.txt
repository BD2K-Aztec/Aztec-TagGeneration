systems_biology identifying critical transitions of complex_diseases based on a single sample motivation unlike traditional diagnosis of an existing disease_state detecting the pre disease_state just before the serious deterioration of a disease is a challenging_task because the state of the system may show little apparent change or symptoms before this critical_transition during disease_progression by exploring the rich interaction information provided by high_throughput data the dynamical network bio marker dnb can identify the pre disease_state but this requires multiple samples to reach a correct_diagnosis for one individual thereby restricting its clinical_application results in this article we have developed a novel computational_approach based on the dnb theory and differential distributions between the expressions of dnb and non dnb molecules which can detect the pre disease_state reliably even from a single sample taken from one individual by compensating insufficient samples with existing datasets from population studies our approach has been validated by the successful identification of pre disease samples from subjects or individuals before the emergence of disease symptoms for acute_lung influenza and breast_cancer based on only one single sample from an individual traditional biomarkers can indicate whether the sample is in a given disease_state or not however they cannot generally diagnose the predisease state which can be viewed as a special normal state just before major deterioration or critical_transition to a disease in other words it is a highly challenging_problem to distinguish the pre disease_state from the normal state because there may be little apparent_difference between these two states in contrast to the generally significant_difference between the normal state and the disease_state or the early disease_state one way to detect early signals of an abrupt change in a system is to directly construct a mathematical_model for the system and predict the progression details however in most realistic cases such a model for a specific system or a disease is not available due to the complicated and uncertain nature of most such systems the critical slowing down theory provides a useful way to detect the early warning_signals of critical transitions for a general system and has been applied to ecosystems climate systems economics and global finance however there are two main limitations to this method i it requires a series of time course data for each individual i e a large number of samples for each subject ii the measurements are required to cover those variables that show the critical slowing down dynamics i e extensive knowledge on the system is required clearly for many complex systems in particular biomedical systems it is generally difficult to obtain data or a model of an individual satisfying both these conditions in fact typical data currently available for molecular_biology and medicine are high_throughput omics_data with a small number of samples for each individual but high_dimensions although these data usually lack dynamic information due to the small number of time course samples they are still valuable because of the rich_information regarding correlations or interactions among many variables of the high_throughput measurements with rapid advancements in high_throughput omics_data have been measured and made available for complex_diseases such as asthma attacks epileptic_seizures and many others to overcome the two problems of the critical slowing down method a new model free approach the dynamical network biomarker dnb was developed to detect early warning_signals of complex_diseases even with a small number of samples by exploring fluctuation and correlation information among molecules the dnb can identify the pre disease_state and thus predict the critical_transition before a serious deterioration in contrast to diagnosing the disease_state by traditional to whom correspondence should be addressed biomarkers moreover it has been shown that those molecules in dnb are not necessarily the result of the disease but make the first move from the normal state toward the disease_state in a collective manner through a critical_transition one significant feature of dnb members or molecules is that in the pre disease_state they fluctuate dynamically and are strongly correlated therefore this group of molecules or the dnb can characterize the dynamic_features of the underlying system and provide early warning_signals for detecting the imminent critical_transition the dnb has been successfully_applied to many complex_diseases such as liver_cancer to detect sudden deterioration and study the underlying_mechanisms although the dnb can identify the pre disease_state it still requires multiple samples for an individual thereby restricting its clinic application clearly identifying the pre disease_state with only a single sample in a reliable manner is challenging but of great_importance since it provides not only a feasible and cost_effective method for clinic diagnosis but also significantly relieves the burden of sample collections for individuals in this article by exploring the differential distributions of dnb members and non dnb members we developed a novel computational_method for efficiently and accurately identifying the predisease state before the critical_transition in a complex disease with just a single sample specifically dnb molecules typically have a double peak distribution in the pre disease_state owing to their strongly fluctuating and correlated nature in the pre disease stage but have a single peak distribution in the normal state due to their dynamically stable behavior in the normal stage see_supplementary a for details on the other hand non dnb molecules are observed to show a single peak distribution even in the predisease state due to their stable behavior thus differential distributions between those groups of molecules can be identified from a single sample provided there are multiple control samples which are generally available in practice in this article we use kullbackleibler divergence kl divergence which measures the difference between two data distributions to formulate the dnb single sample score the dnb s score by three factors each factor in the dnb s score reflects an aspect of the dynamic_features when the system is near a transition_point based on this scheme a new scoring criterion i e the dnb s score was proposed as a quantitative measurement of each sample note that too few genes in the dnb may give a biased result due to incomplete_information on the distribution moreover we have theoretically and numerically shown that the dnb s score is relatively high when the system is in a predisease state and relatively low when the system is in a normal or disease_state hence the dnb s score provides a reliable signal to identify the pre disease_state both theoretical and computational results show that high_dimensional information of data can be utilized to compensate insufficient samples which is the main_reason why dnb can detect the pre disease_state by a single sample with high_throughput measurements in addition our previous study indicates that the dnb s score is a model free approach that can be theoretically applied to any disease or biological system with clear transition events furthermore the dnb s score in this work is not used for identifying the critical transition_point or early disease_state but for detecting the state just before the critical transition_point i e the pre disease_state and therefore in comparison with existing_methods it is of great_importance for the early_diagnosis of complex_diseases to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the theoretical work we applied our method to detect the predisease state for three diseases by single samples i e lung_injury induced by carbonyl chloride inhalation_exposure gse mcf human breast_cancer resulting from heregulin hrg gse and human influenza_infection caused by h n virus gse all of which successfully validated our predictions we use a single sample with high_throughput data e g genomics or proteomics_data to identify the pre disease_state or early warning_signal of a disease based on the dnb s score achieving such a reliable diagnosis is of great_importance in clinic application since one sample can be obtained much more easily than multiple samples for each individual who does not yet exhibit any disease symptoms during the short period before the critical_transition in this article we developed a novel computational_method i e the dnb s scoring_method to identify the pre disease_state of a disease on the basis of a single sample which facilitates early_diagnosis before the disease_state or its serious deterioration from the viewpoints of both theoretical_analysis and numerical computation we have demonstrated that the dnb s score is sensitive to any sample near the pre disease_state all the results show that we identified the pre disease_state i e the state just before a critical_transition to the disease_state rather than the disease_state targeted by traditional biomarkers by developing this method we also found that a single case sample with highthroughput measurements actually has enriched information sufficient for early_diagnosis even if there is no reliable disease model i e the underlying mechanism of disease deterioration is unclear in other words the dnb s score is a model free approach which is capable of exploiting high_dimensional information or interaction information on high_dimensional and thus distinguishing pre disease samples from normal ones our study makes two main contributions first the dnb s score can identify the pre disease_state before moving into the deteriorated disease_state by a critical_transition rather than diagnosing the disease_state therefore it has profound potential to achieve real early_diagnosis for complex_diseases second the dnb s score can detect the pre disease_state with only a single sample for each individual which is of great_importance for clinic applications in realistic cases such as clinic testing and personalized healthcare all the results show that highdimensional information of data can be used to compensate for insufficient samples which is the major reason why the dnb s score can detect the pre disease_state from a single high_throughput sample it is also worth noting that this method is based on the dnb theory and thus the molecules in the dnb can be related to the leading network of the disease those molecules may make the first move from the normal state toward the disease_state through a critical_transition and thus be causally related to diseasedriving genes or networks therefore the dnb s score can be a reflection of the leading factors the driving network or diseasedriving genes to the serious deterioration of complex_diseases in addition to the diagnosis of diseases our method can be applied to the analysis of other complex processes or phenomena in biology physics ecology or even economics in a similar manner provided that drastic state_transitions are involved in these processes e g cell_differentiation and cell_cycle processes
