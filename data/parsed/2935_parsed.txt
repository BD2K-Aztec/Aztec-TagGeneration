methylflow cell specific methylation pattern reconstruction from high_throughput bisulfite_converted sequencing motivation dna_methylation aberrations are now known to almost universally accompany the initiation and progression of cancers in particular the colon_cancer epigenome contains specific gen_omic regions that along with differences in methylation_levels with respect to normal_colon tissue also show increased epigenetic and gene_expression heterogeneity at the population level i e across tumor_samples in comparison with other regions in the genome tumors are highly_heterogeneous at the clonal level as well and the relationship between clonal and population heterogeneity is poorly_understood results we present an approach that uses sequencing_reads from high_throughput of bisulfite_converted to reconstruct heterogeneous_cell by assembling cell specific methylation patterns our methodology is based on the solution of a specific class of minimum cost network flow problems we use our methods to analyze the relationship between clonal het erogeneity and population heterogeneity in high coverage data from multiple samples of colon tumor and matched_normal availability_and dna_methylation dnam is a gene regulatory_mechanism where silencing of gene_expression is established by the chemical bond of methyl_groups to dna at specific_genomic it is the best understood heritable mechanism for gene_regulation that does not involve direct modification of dna_sequence itself high_throughput of bisulfite_converted is used to measure dnam modifications at base_pair level this approach has led to deeper_understanding of the methylomes organization and its role in development and disease while single_cell methods to sequence bisulfite_converted are currently under development the most reliable current method to measure dnam at the base_pair level across the entire methylome is to bisulfite convert and sequence dna from a population of cells a number of existing computational_methods may then be used to calculate the percentage of dna_fragments that harbor a dnam modification at specific genomic_loci in many normal_human for example these percentages vary from the expected levels in a population of diploid cells with identical dnam modifications where all cells in the population are methylated at a specific locus where all cells in the population are unmethylated or where only one chromosome in all cells in the population are methylated for example in the normal_colon methylome the majority of the methylome is partially methylated at a level of roughly similar patterns are observed in other human tissues and tissues in other eukaryotes an obvious observation that follows from this is that cell_populations in normal_tissues are composed of epigenetically heterogenous cells furthermore when comparing dnam across different tissues for example colon normal_tissue and colon tumor or a population of stem_cells to a population of somatic_cells e g fibroblast differences in dnam percentages at a specific locus is indicative of a shift in the epigenetic composition of these cell_populations computational and statistical_methods to study the epigenetic composition of cell_populations have been proposed based on the analysis of dnam modifications at multiple consecutive genomic_loci spanned by single sequencing_reads where they analyzed dnam modifications at each group of four contiguous cpg_dinucleotides using sequencing_reads that span all four cpgs they then calculate the proportion of reads compatible with each of the possible dnam modifications over these four positions they summarize these proportions to define the epipolymorphism of each set of four contiguous cpgs while these approaches have yielded great insight into how cell_populations differ epigenetically across different tissues they only provide a general summary of the epigenetic composition of these cell_populations for instance distinguishing between the two types of cell_population shifts illustrated in is limited to those differences observed over four contiguous cpgs to perform a comprehensive analysis of these cell_population shifts the ability to reconstruct cellspecific methylation patterns over longer genomic spans is required in this article we present methylflow a novel computational_method to reconstruct cell specific patterns using reads obtained from sequencing bisulfite_converted based on network flow algorithms we report on a simulation_study characterizing the behavior of our method we then present an application of this method using ultra high coverage targeted sequence in a colon_cancer study and on whole_genome of fully_differentiated b cells and ksl and clp progenitor_cells kieffer we also perform a validation study using bisulfiteconverted dna from single cells we believe that this method will allow for increased understanding of the role of epigenetic heterogeneity at the cell_population level in gene_regulation
