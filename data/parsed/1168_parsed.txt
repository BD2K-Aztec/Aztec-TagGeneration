copynumber kcancer baseline correction for accurate copy_number calling from the k methylation array the illumina_infinium k is widely used for the evaluation of dna methylation_levels in large_scale datasets particularly in cancer the k design allows copy_number variant cnv_calling using existing bioinformatics_tools however in cancer samples numerous large_scale aberrations cause shifting in the probe intensities and thereby may result in erroneous cnv_calling therefore a baseline correction process is needed we suggest the maximum peak of probe segment density to correct the shift in the intensities in cancer samples availability_and copynumber kcancer is implemented as an r package the package with examples can be downloaded at http cran rdna methylation is the most studied epigenetic_modification in cancer and many other diseases many technologies and platforms have been developed to facilitate dna_methylation analysis such as bisulphite conversion followed by analysis using dna_methylation arrays the illumina_infinium k provides detection of methylation_levels of approximately cpg loci across the human_genome the k platform is based on similar biochemical_reaction principle and technology as the infinium snp_arrays making it possible to use the k platform to detect copy_number cnvs as a zero cost byproduct of methylation studies recently bioinformatics_tools were developed for copy_number cn calling from methylation data e g champ copynumber k and conumee www bioconductor org cn calling consists of the following principal steps normalization of probe intensities calculation of the log r ratios lrrs segmentation and determination of copy_number for each segment based on a chosen cutoff_level or a p value threshold in each step different algorithms methods and parameters can be applied however in cancer samples the large and numerous chromosomal duplications and deletions cause a shift in the lrrs away from the hypothetical baseline level i e n diploid level resulting in erroneous cnv_calling the conventional normalization_methods e g quantile and functional normalization as well as the median average sample centering cannot overcome this problem a similar centering problem was observed in copy_number calling from arraybased comparative_genomic acgh data for cancer samples the density of the probes was suggested to help determine v c the author published_by cn calling from the k data is possible but faces some difficulties in some cancer samples due to incorrect sample centering and baseline shifting without solving this issue the cn calling will be inaccurate wecopynumber kcancersuccessfully tested the mdpe method on k cancer segmentation data copynumber kcancer package implements the mdpe method together with interactive reviewing to efficiently correct the baseline in cancer samples the main advantages for copynumber kcancer are fast auto correction few seconds per sample high_accuracy rate in sample correction no input_parameters needed low computer resources_required and adaptable to k similar technologies
