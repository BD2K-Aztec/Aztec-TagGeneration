sdeap a splice graph_based differential transcript_expression analysis tool for population data motivation differential transcript_expression dte analysis without predefined conditions is critical to biological studies for example it can be used to discover biomarkers to classify cancer samples into previously_unknown subtypes such that better diagnosis and therapy methods can be developed for the subtypes although several dte tools for population data i e data without known biological conditions have been published these tools either assume binary conditions in the input population or require the number of conditions as a part of the input fixing the number of conditions to binary is unrealistic and may distort the results of a dte analysis estimating the correct number of conditions in a population could also be challenging for a routine user moreover the existing_tools only provide differential usages of exons which may be insufficient to interpret the patterns of alternative_splicing across samples and restrains the applications of the tools from many biology studies results we propose a novel dte analysis algorithm called sdeap that estimates the number of conditions directly from the input samples using a dirichlet mixture_model and discovers alternative_splicing using a new graph modular decomposition algorithm by taking_advantage of the above technical improvement sdeap was able to outperform the other dte analysis methods in our extensive experiments on simulated_data with qpcr validation the prediction of sdeap also allowed us to classify the samples of cancer_subtypes and cell_cycle more accurately in recent_years rna_seq has taken a major role in the quantitative analysis of transcript_expression and variant discovery and become a vital component of genomic and transcriptomic research for case_control several differential transcript_expression dte analysis methods such as cuffdiff deseq edger and alexa seq have been developed to discover genes that have differentially_expressed transcripts whose abundance values alter between known biological conditions in addition to the dte methods differential splicing ds analysis methods such as miso fdm mats dexseq and diffsplice are focused on identifying difference in relative_abundance of transcripts note that a change in the absolute abundance of a transcript may result from a change in the basal expression_level of the corresponding gene its splicing ratio or both in other words dte methods should be able to discover ds events but not vice_versa moreover the dte and ds analyses may also find many important_applications in population_based studies where predefined conditions are unavailable a priori for example a recent population study to improve the diagnosis and prognosis for breast_cancer shows that triple_negative can be further classified into six subtypes based on the differential analysis of the expression_profiles of patients each of the six subtypes has different sensitivities to targeted_therapies to understand the functions and mechanisms during cell development or differentiation differentially_expressed transcripts are used to characterize cell_types or specificity in a mixed_population due to the emergent demand for computational_tools for dte and ds analyses without known biological conditions several methods have been proposed recently siber and dexus test differential_expression by looking at the numbers of reads_mapped to individual genes or exons an extended protocol of deseq has been published_recently to_identify for single_cell sc rna_seq based on ercc spike in data sigfuge compares the areas under normalized read_depth curves to call ds genes in a dte analysis the expression of genes or transcripts is summarized by numerical features called expression features e g read_counts of genes or exons in dexus and areas under normalized read_depth curves in sigfuge the dte of genes is assessed by calculating the variation of the expression features across the samples of different biological conditions when the biological conditions of samples are not predefined to test whether an expression feature has experienced differential_expression the input samples are usually clustered based on the expression levels of the feature across the samples the clusters of the samples are then used as the biological conditions and the variation of the expression feature between the conditions is then measured statistically clearly the correctness of the clustering is critical to the dte analysis when the biological conditions is not available both siber and sigfuge assume that the input population consists of only two conditions and always cluster the samples into two clusters this assumption is unrealistic in many applications and an incorrect partition or clustering of samples may lead to unreliable conclusions of differential_expression tests although dexus also assumes binary conditions by default it allows the user to input the number of the biological conditions which will be used as the number of clusters on all expression features however specifying the correct number of the biological conditions directly from samples is difficult for a routine user moreover since some expression features may exhibit little variability on a subset of the biological conditions the optimal numbers of clusters for individual expression features may differ and may not always be equal to the number of biological conditions defined by the user even when the user_defined number is correctly specified hence a computational_method that can determine the numbers of clusters automatically from data is urgently_needed to conduct reliable dte analyses when the biological conditions are not available in addition to the challenge in specifying the number of clusters these tools only report changes in coverage of exons of genes by rna_seq which do not directly suggest how and where transcript_expression diverges as a result of alternative_splicing ases such ase information could be valuable in down stream applications in their own right e g as biomarkers in several cancer studies to address_these in the existing dte analysis tools several technical improvements have been made in a new dte analysis algorithm called sdeap in sdeap the number of clusters for expression feature is no longer fixed as two or required as a part of the input instead a dirichlet infinite mixture_model is applied to determine the number of clusters for every expression feature by fitting the data optimally to further discover ases a graphical data_structure called the splice graph is used in sdeap to model the structures and abundance of all transcripts of a gene such that ases can be represented by decomposing the graph into alternative_splicing modules asms as originally proposed in diffsplice however the graph modular decomposition algorithm employed in diffsplice is not used here because we have found a counterexample to its correctness see the supplementary_materials for a detailed discussion a corrected algorithm is described in this paper and implemented in sdeap moreover a method accounting for variability due to technical noise across biological or technical_replicates has been adopted to reduce the number_of in sdeap to assess the prediction_accuracy of sdeap extensive experiments on both simulated_and were conducted to compare sdeap with dexus siber was excluded from our comparisons because the performance of siber and dexus in detecting the variation of read_coverage of genes and exons due to dte has been compared in dexus was shown to constantly outperform siber and moreover siber can only be run on large_datasets of more than rna_seq samples in our simulation_experiments sdeap outperformed dexus by at least in the area under precision_recall curve or aucpr which is used as the assessment of overall performance on average the numbers of conditions for at least genes in the simulated_data were correctly_predicted by sdeap although ds analysis is not the main purpose of sdeap we compared it with sigfuge in the detection of changes in relative_abundance of transcripts by repeating the simulated experiments in sdeap discovered more ds genes than sigfuge without producing any false_positives furthermore the performance of sdeap is also compared to that of three state of theart dte methods namely deseq cuffdiff and edger that require known binary conditions as a part of the input using simulated_datasets when the numbers of individuals from each condition are not highly imbalanced there is no noticeable difference between the prediction_accuracy of sdeap and that of the three methods the time efficiency of sdeap is discussed in the supplementary_materials to further demonstrate the utility of sdeap in real biological_applications the dte genes predicted by sdeap were used as biomarkers to classify different cancer_subtypes cell_types and cell_cycle on several recently_published rna_seq these applications are interesting because some critical diseases e g breast_cancer bc are known as heterogeneous_diseases with a variety of transcriptomic alterations that severely affect the diagnosis and prognosis of the diseases finding dte genes that could be used as transcriptomic biomarkers to identify subtypes of such diseases could be important for the design of clinical_trials to investigate targeted treatments moreover the expression_patterns of transcripts in individual cells of different cell_types or cell_cycle which can be revealed by the sc rna_seq technology nowadays are fundamental to studies on alternative cellular_functions during the development of a tissue or an organ our real_data experiments demonstrate that the classification of rna_seq samples using the ases from sdeap is much more consistent with the real_biological conditions i e cancer_subtypes cell_types and cell_cycle than using the differentially_expressed exons predicted by dexus the prediction results of both methods were also compared with the qpcr validations of gene_expression more validated dte genes were covered by the prediction of sdeap these results suggests that sdeap also performs dte analysis well on real population data
