bioinformatics_discovery structural_bioinformatics a divergent calponin homology nn ch domain defines a novel family implications for evolution of ciliary ift complex b proteins motivation microtubules are dynamic polymers of tubulin dimers that undergo continuous assembly and disassembly a mounting number of microtubule associated proteins maps regulate the dynamic_behavior of microtubules and hence the assembly and disassembly of disparate microtubule structures within the cell despite recent_advances in identification and functional characterization of maps a substantial number of microtubule accessory_factors have not been functionally annotated here using profile to profile comparisons and structure modeling we show that the yeast outer kinetochore components ndc and nuf share evolutionary ancestry with a novel protein_family in mammals comprising besides ndc hec and nuf three intraflagellar_transport ift complex b subunits ift ift cluap as well as six proteins with poorly_defined function fam a c ccdc ccdc and c orf we show that these proteins consist of a divergent n_terminal calponin homology ch like domain adjoined to an array of c terminal heptad repeats predicted to form a coiled_coil arrangement we have named the divergent ch like domain nnch after the founding members ndc and nuf microtubules are dynamic polymers that form a variety of cytoskeletal constellations in the eukaryotic_cell common to all microtubule arrangements ranging from the short centrioles of the centrosome to the elaborate structures of the mitotic_spindle in mitosis or the axoneme of cilia are a set of microtubule associated proteins maps that influence the dynamics stability and function of the tubulin polymer many putative maps and accessory components of the mitotic_spindle centrosome and cilia have not been functionally annotated this is due in part to the high_abundance of coiled_coil propensity proteins populating these subcellular_compartments e g coiled_coil containing proteins are notoriously_difficult to functionally annotate because of the high degree of sequence redundancy of coiled_coils which renders coiled_coil segments unsuitable for phylogenetic_analysis some maps associated with e g kinetochores or centrosomes however adopt a bipartite structure comprising besides their coiled_coil hub a globular head domain the presence of such a conserved domain can greatly_facilitate the identification of remote_homologs in other species for instance in ndc hec in humans hereafter referred to as ndc and nuf of the ndc kinetochore complex or the microtubule plus end tracking proteins eb the coiled_coil region is preceded by a conserved n_terminal calponin homology ch domain which has aided in the identification of orthologs in the ndc kinetochore complex formed by heterodimerization of ndc and nuf the interaction between the c terminal coiled_coil regions produces a microtubule binding_interface consisting of two tightly interacting ch domains structural analysis has indicated that the ndc ch domain resembles that of the first ch domain of human fimbrin which itself adopts a divergent ch domain fold despite this structural_similarity previous sequence_based analyses have not identified ndc as a member the proposed major groups of ch domaincontaining proteins here we show by means of sequence_profile to profile analysis that ndc and nuf three intraflagellar_transport ift complex b subunits as well as six other poorly_defined proteins constitute a novel family of bimodular proteins containing a divergent n_terminal ch like domain followed by a c terminal region of heptad repeats predicted to form a coiled_coil arrangement we have named the divergent ch like domain nnch after the founding members ndc and nuf in an effort to functionally annotate uncharacterized members of the core centrosome as well as accessory_factors we surveyed the protein architecture of previously_identified and putative centrosomal proteins we noted that proteins such as c orf cgi and fam b bear homology by sequence to the n terminus of kinetochore protein ndc high_probability sequence_similarities between e g the n terminus of human fam b aa with the n terminus of ndc are apparent by hmm_based profile to profile searches using either local or global search algorithms in hhpred local global probabilities and e values interestingly as with ndc the c terminus of human fam b contains disparate arrays of heptad repeats as predicted by weighted and unweighted matrices in coils indicating that these proteins are members of a common evolutionary family of coiled_coil proteins to identify additional ndc paralog candidates we first searched the pfam_database in hhpred using a hmm_based on five reiterative psi blast_searches initiated with the nn ch domain of human ndc aa this search identified the duf domain pfam entry pf of the fam protein_family as the highest scoring match probability e suggesting that fam ac carry a nn ch domain the alignment of duf was merged with the ndc alignment to initiate a subsequent hmmhmm searchhydrophobicity is conserved which participate in the alpha_helices of the ch fold are blue and designated h in the consensus_sequence shown below the alignment aromatic_residues are abbreviated a hydrophobic h blue histidine tyrosine turquoise acidic violet glycine brown proline light green and serine_threonine dark green regions corresponding to alpha_helices predicted by hhpred and based on ndc are shown above the alignment see also supplementary for accession_numbers see supplementaryagainst the pfam_database we repeated this procedure once more totalling three iterative hmmhmm searches to compile all the matched alignments that produced only high_probability scores the resulting msa was used to kick start hmm hmm searches in the pfam_database directed specifically against human proteins we thus identified human proteins with high_probability homology to the ndc n terminus figs and supplementary each protein was validated by reciprocal hmmhmm searches for the occurrence of a conserved nnch domain in each instance the minimal n terminal_portion showing sequence_homology to ndc was extracted and used as a query in hhpred we confirmed the presence of the nnch domain in all identified proteins with probability_values suggesting genuine homology to the nnch domain of ndc alignmentbased secondary_structure using the ali d program http toolkit tuebingen mpg de ali d supported these findings supplementary further we could predict an n_terminal tertiary_structure model of each protein nnch domain that was compatible with the known d structure of the ndc n terminus supplementary structural threading using modeller confirmed human ndc igp as the best and statistically_significant match in a search in the pdb database for similar tertiary_structures detailed list of all pdb entries found is available upon request to examine the nnch proteins for the co occurrence of coiled_coil conformations the c terminal_portion of each protein candidate was first probed for the presence of heptad repeats in coils and subsequently_analyzed in hnn for high alpha_helical content coinciding with heptad_repeat tendency interestingly all newly_identified nnch domain containing proteins were predicted to harbor c termini consisting of long alpha_helical matrices exhibiting a high degree coiled_coil propensity suggesting that all the nnch protein derivatives structurally resemble ndc although the n_terminal domain of ndc was shown to adopt a ch domain fold our searches failed to detect any high_scoring matches to canonical ch domaincontaining proteins such as eb consistent with previous sequence_based analyses of ch domain containing proteins likewise a hmmhmm search seeded with the ch domain of human eb failed to recover significant matches to any of the newly_identified nnch domain bearing protein_profiles in pfam indicating that the nnch domain represents a discrete branch of the ch domain protein_family in support of this a comparative_analysis of the history and evolution of the nnch family_members as assessed by pair_wise blast_searches against representative proteomes revealed that all nnch family_members likely evolved from a precursor of yeast ndc and nuf supplementary the ndc and nuf proteins thus share common_ancestry with all nnch domain derivatives based on the homology of nnch proteins to components of the yeast ndc nuf kinetochore complex we propose that these proteins including the ciliary iftb proteins identified in this survey evolved at least partly as a specialized form of the kinetochore ndc p complex
