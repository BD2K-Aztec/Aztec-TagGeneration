rapid and enhanced remote_homology by cascading hidden_markov searches in sequence_space motivation in the post genomic era automatic_annotation of protein_sequences using computational homology based_methods is highly_desirable however often protein_sequences diverge to an extent where detection of homology and automatic_annotation transfer is not straightforward sophisticated approaches to detect such distant relationships are needed we propose a new approach to identify deep evolutionary_relationships of proteins to overcome shortcomings of the available methods results we have developed a method to identify remote homologues more effectively from any protein_sequence database by using several cascading events with hidden_markov c hmm we have implemented clustering of hits and profile generation of hit clusters to effectively reduce the computational timings of the cascaded sequence searches our c hmm approach could cover and coverage at family superfamily and fold levels respectively when applied on diverse protein_folds we have compared c hmm with various remote_homology methods and discuss the trade_offs between coverage and false_positives availability_and a standalone package implemented_in along with a detailed documentation can be downloaded from https github comrapid increase in genome_sequencing initiatives has led to the accumulation of a huge amount of sequence_information that needs detailed annotation structural and functional characterization of new proteins is a critical task and it is often based on the sequence_similarity with proteins of known structure and function but in some cases proteins diverge to an extent where relationships between them cannot be easily established using direct sequence_search based_approaches such evolutionary distant proteins are called as remote homologues and detection of such remote relationships is still a challenging_task accurate detection of remote homologues can facilitate the assignment of putative functions to uncharacterized_proteins improving genomic function_annotations in many cases functional_annotation can be achieved using protein_structures asstructural divergence is much slower than sequence_divergence however protein structural_information is limited and the growth of structure databases is also relatively very slow with the continuous expansion of sequence_databases there is a growing need for a protocol to identify such distant homologues by exploiting mere sequence_information many methods based on position_specific pssm and profile_hidden hmm have been developed to detect distant relationships between protein_sequences for example positionspecific iterated blast derives a pssm from multiple_sequences identified by blast_searches which are further used to search sequence database to identify newer hits in an iterative manner the drawback of psi_blast is that it can converge before finding all the true_positive hits on the other hand probabilistic_model based profile_hmms are more sensitive and efficient in remote homolog detection hmmer utility provides one such package named jackhmmer which iterates profile_hmms till convergence to detect distant relationships of proteins profile_hmms are similar to sequence_profiles but in addition to the amino_acid frequencies in the columns of a multiple_sequence they also contain position specific probabilities for insertions_and along the alignment profile_hmms are more sensitive than blast pssms since position_specific penalties penalize chance hits more as compared with true_positives hmmhmm comparison as implemented in hhsearch and hhblits is also an effective method to identify remote homologues in principle these methods extract information from intermediate sequences that share sequence properties of multiple remotely related proteins to detect remote homologues when the relation between two remote homologues is not evident these intermediate sequences serve as steppingstones for hopping through sequence_space for example hits from the first generation serve as intermediate sequences to detect homologues in the second generation of psi_blast we have shown earlier that the intermediate sequence approach can be utilized more effectively by cascading through psi_blast over various generations to cover more distant relationships at family superfamily and fold levels yet a major_drawback of using psi_blast in cascade searches is the computational time which increases considerably with the size and complexity of the databases lending it almost impossible to apply on large sequence_databases in this study we have proposed a new protocol called cascadehmm c hmm that can be used to identify remote homologues from protein sequence_databases the primary motivation of developing c hmm is to permit effective remote_homology against any available sequence database irrespective of its size chmm involves cascading of hmms through various generations to detect true distant homologues even at superfamily and fold levels we also show that clustering of protein_sequences followed by profile generation helps in effective detection of remote homologues in addition we have compared different remote_homology methods to provide insights about proper usage of different approaches prior to initiating sequence searches our analysis highlighted that blast based_methods perform more adequately at the family and superfamily levels while hmm based_methods are overall more efficient for sequence searches even at the fold level
