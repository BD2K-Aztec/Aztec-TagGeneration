optimization of alignment_based for taxonomic_binning of metagenomics reads motivation alignment based taxonomic_binning for metagenome characterization proceeds in two steps reads mapping against a reference_database rdb and taxonomic_assignment according to the best hits beyond the sequencing_technology and the completeness of the rdb selecting the optimal configuration of the workflow in particular the mapper parameters and the best_hit selection threshold to get the highest binning performance remains quite empirical results we developed a statistical_framework to perform such optimization at a minimal computational_cost using an optimization experimental_design and simulated_datasets for three sequenc ing technologies we built accurate prediction_models for five performance indicators and then derived the parameter configuration providing the optimal_performance whatever the mapper and the dataset we observed that the optimal configuration yielded better performance than the default configuration and that the best_hit selection threshold had a large impact on performance finally on a reference dataset from the human_microbiome we confirmed that the optimized configuration increased the performance compared with the default configuration availability_and not applicable metagenomics is the study of the dna_content of a sample particularly powerful to recover complex mix of organisms including those difficult to isolate by standard techniques in the last decade the advent_of ngs_technologies has quickly shifted metagenomics approaches from low scale studies to large_scale investigations thereby creating a need for improvement and development of specific bioinformatic_methods taxonomic_profiling and taxonomic_binning are popular_methods to assess the taxonomic diversity of a sequenced sample taxonomic_profiling methods aim to estimate the relative_abundance of each taxon in the sample by classifying reads using a set of marker_genes specific to each taxonomic clade or based on their k_mer composition taxonomic_binning methods aim to assign each individual read to a given taxon within the microbial taxonomy they are not as fast as taxonomic_profiling methods to generate a taxonomic profile nevertheless reads binning is a mandatory step for subsequent analysis that require draft_genome reconstruction taxonomic_binning algorithms are based either on read_alignment strategies or on compositional approaches such as nucleotide k_mer frequencies or possibly on a mixture of these two approaches in this article we focused on alignment based taxonomic_binning methods whose principle was introduced by such methods proceed generally in two steps first reads are aligned against a reference_database rdb then for each read the lowest_common lca among the best hits is retrieved to this end a threshold is applied to select only hits whose scores lie within a percentage of the best_hit score several evaluation studies have been published that compare mapper performance for resequencing applications however in the context of taxonomic_binning there is still no consensus on which mapper and configuration to use the most comprehensive study to date was performed in the context of the human_microbiome hmp wherecompared six mappers and optimized the parameters for the best mapper clc clcbio website http www clcbio com by testing six combinations of two parameter_values beyond the ngs_technology e g read_length sequencing_error profile and the completeness of the rdb taxonomic_binning performance depends on the mapper configuration and the taxonomic_assignment strategy mappers can have many parameters e g more than alignment and score parameters for bowtie some being numerical and other categorical often with many levels it is nearly impossible to evaluate the performance of all parameter configurations to identify the best one here we present a statistical_framework to efficiently select the optimal configuration mapper parameters and best_hit threshold for lca calculation which maximizes taxonomic_binning performance for a given ngs_technology and level of rdb completeness we relied on the design of experiments doe methodology nist sematech e handbook of statistical_methods http www itl nist gov div handbook to reduce the number of configurations to run while still efficiently analyzing the parameter_space this optimization strategy could be adapted to any ngs_technology applied to different mappers and adjusted according to the targeted microbial complexity and distinct levels of the rdb completeness
