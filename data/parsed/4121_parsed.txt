sequence_analysis sbal a practical tool to generate and edit structure based amino_acid both alignment generation and visualization are important processes for producing biologically_meaningful sequence_alignments computational_tools that combine reliable automated and semi_automated approaches to produce secondary_structure based alignments with an appropriate visualization of the results are rare we have developed sbal a tool to generate and edit secondary_structure based sequence_alignments it is easy to install and provides a user_friendly interface sequence_alignments are displayed with secondary_structure assignments mapped to their corresponding regions in the sequence by using a simple colour scheme the algorithm implemented for automated and semi_automated secondary_structure based alignment calculations shows a comparable_performance to existing software availability_and sbal has been implemented_in to provide cross_platform compatibility sbal is freely_available to academic users at http www structuralchemistry org pcsb users will be asked for their name institution and email address accurate amino_acid are central to many bioinformatic biochemical and structural studies in structural_biology amino_acid are used to not only identify conserved_residues that may be functionally_significant but also regions of conserved secondary_structure that may provide information on the overall fold of the molecule of the alignment_algorithms that are currently available only a handful take into account secondary_structure information namely praline spem promals ispalign and opal despite using different approaches to implement secondary_structure information into multiple_sequence these programs have shown to whom correspondence should be addressed that significant improvements in accuracy can be achieved when secondary_structure information is included however a limitation of currently available programs is that they do not provide an easy means of visualizing alignments and secondary_structure after they have been generated the visualization of alignments is an important part of the entire_process of alignment generation not only for quality_control but also for analysis and interpretation of the biological_context of the alignments additionally manual editing can frequently improve alignments because most algorithms apply heuristic approaches that may not generate an optimal_solution despite the variety of alignment programs and viewers available we found the process of generating secondary structurebased alignments and appropriate visualization difficult some tools are only available as web_based applications and others require complex installation and compilation some visualization_tools are specialized for other purposes such as for phylogenetic reconstructions additionally visualization of secondary_structure assignments on a multiple_sequence in most programs is complicated and does not allow for easy visual comparisons we have implemented a simple to use and portable java_application that aids in the generation of structure based sequence_alignments by providing an automated alignment that may be edited and improved by the user through a user_friendly graphical_user currently there is a need for a computational_tool that facilitates the seamless transition from secondary_structure based alignments to the visualization of the results in this context we have developed sbal to generate and edit secondary_structure based sequence_alignments sbal has been implemented_in to provide cross_platform compatibility it is easy to install and provides an interactive user_friendly interface users can choose to either generate secondary_structure based alignments using sbal or import alignment results from other programs for visualization and editing thus making sbal a very versatile and practical tool for a wide_range of scenarios a variety of established input_formats fasta msf and clustalw are supported to ensure compatibility with commonly used alignment programs secondary_structure information can be provided by different means predicted_secondary by psipred can be processed from the psipred vertical ss files or horizontal horiz files format extracted from experimental d structures by dssp or directly from the header of protein_data files helix and sheet records secondary_structure information is instantly mapped to the corresponding regions of the sequences by using a redgreen colour scheme to facilitate visual comparisons we have implemented a progressive multiple_alignment algorithm that aims to maximize secondary_structure and amino_acid matches using position specific information there are three fundamental steps i an initial guide_tree construction followed by ii a dynamic_programming based alignment generation and iii a final polishing step that realigns the sequences sbal produces alignments of a comparable quality as those achieved using other structurebased alignment programs see_supplementary for a more thorough analysis although some features that have been proposed to further improve accuracy have not been implemented in sbal and are destined for inclusion in the near future multiple amino_acid can be modified by the user through insertion and deletion of gaps as well as horizontal movement of sequences with respect to the alignment n or c terminal extensions of sequences that should not be included in the alignment can be truncated within sbal these functions can be executed for an individual sequence or a user selected group of sequences scores representing the level of sequence and secondary_structure conservation of the alignment are displayed in the status bar the vertical order of sequences within the alignment can also be changed alignments are saved in three file_formats with the same root name sbal html and fasta reloading the sbal file allows the user to continue to work on the alignment the html output is considered the best format for dissemination since it can be loaded into other editors or word processing programs without losing the secondary_structure mapping the fasta output_file is provided for interfacing with other bioinformatic software
