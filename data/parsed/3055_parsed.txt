structural_bioinformatics model_quality for membrane_proteins motivation learning based model_quality programs have been quite successful at discriminating between high and low quality protein_structures here we show that it is possible to improve this performance significantly by restricting the learning space to a specific context in this case membrane_proteins since these are among the most important structures from a pharmaceutical point_of it is particularly interesting to resolve local model quality for regions corresponding e g to binding_sites results our new proqm method uses a support_vector with a combination of general and membrane_protein specific features for the transmembrane_region proqm clearly outperforms all methods developed for generic proteins and it does so while maintaining performance for extra membrane_domains in this region it is only matched by proqres the predictor is shown to accurately_predict quality both on the global and local_level when applied to gpcr models and clearly outperforms consensus based_scoring finally the combination of proqm and the rosetta low_resolution energy function achieve a fold enrichment in selection of near native structural_models at very limited computational_cost availability proqm is available as a server atcomputational modeling of d structure of protein molecules is an important research area that has the potential to dramatically accelerate the determination of protein_structures both in terms of purely predicted structures and as part of an otherwise experimental pipeline an increase in the number of proteins for which high_quality structural data is available would greatly enhance our ability to understand biological_function redesign proteins of interest and develop new drugs which might even be peptides themselves membrane_proteins are particularly interesting for medical_applications but structure_prediction of these proteins is still in its infancy compared with globular_proteins fortunately many methods in particular sequence_based ones originally developed for water soluble_proteins can be applied directly to membrane to whom correspondence should be addressed proteins however methods using knowledgebased potentials derived from existing water soluble_proteins need to be changed and adapted to account both for the specific membrane_environment and composition of membrane_proteins many structure_prediction that approaches today can generate a large number of models either by constructing models from alignments to different templates or by sampling different regions of the conformational_space a scoring_function or model_quality program mqap is then required to discriminate highquality models from imperfect ones an ideal scoring_function would produce perfect correlation between the score and quality as measured by the distance to the native_structure the various scoring_functions in use today can roughly be divided_into three classes physics knowledge and learning based for physical scoring_functions the goal is to describe the physics of the interaction between atoms as accurately as possible these functions are often parameterized on much smaller systems than proteins and the typical example is a molecular_mechanics forcefield such as opls charmm or amber knowledge based scoring_functions in contrast derive probability_distributions from features extracted from native structures chao finally learning based functions are trained on structural_features to distinguish between correct and incorrect models and to predict the actual quality of a given model the training methods available range from simple optimization of a few parameters to advanced machine_learning such as neural_networks or support_vector svms most scoring_functions have been developed to discriminate between globally incorrect and approximately correct models in contrast only a handful of methods focus on the more general_problem of predicting the correctness of different parts of a protein structural model moreover neither the knowledge nor learning based_methods have been developed specifically for membrane_proteins in principle a physics based scoring_function could be used directly for membrane_proteins but in that case we would be faced with the much more complex task of accurately representing the lipid_bilayer environment around the protein too in addition the success of physics based scoring_functions as mqaps even for globular_proteins has been quite limited in part due to insufficient sampling none of the top ranking mqaps in casp or casp were physics
