structural_bioinformatics characterization of disordered proteins with ensemble ensemble is a computational_approach for determining a set of conformations that represents the structural ensemble of a disordered protein based on input experimental_data the disordered protein can be an unfolded or intrinsically_disordered state here we introduce the latest_version of the program which has been enhanced to facilitate its general release and includes an intuitive_user as well as new approaches to treat data and analyse results availability_and ensemble is a program implemented in c and embedded in a perl wrapper it is supported on main linux distributions source codes and installation files including a detailed example can be freely downloaded ata detailed understanding of biology requires structural and dynamic information for the proteins in the cell and their dynamic excursions for enzymatic and other functions as well as their interactions both transient and long_lived there has been an explosion of structural and dynamic information on folded protein states that has coincided with the development of computational_tools for incorporation of experimental_data into algorithms to describe the dominant conformations populated by stable proteins cns xplor nih and ccp however unfolded and intrinsically_disordered states have not been extensively characterized although they are highly_relevant to both normal and pathological function knowledge of unfolded_states is important for understanding protein_stability and these states are required to traverse the membrane and are involved in aggregation or degradation in many diseases intrinsically_disordered often mediate regulatory protein interactions and can act as entropic springs or steric gates as well as aggregate in disease descriptions of the ensembles of highly_heterogeneous conformations within disordered states are thus required for correlating dynamic structure with function a number of algorithms to calculate such ensembles have been developed our ensemble approach was created to facilitate the incorporation of a large number of different types of experimental_data into the generation of structural ensembles of disordered protein states ensemble makes use of a switching monte_carlo algorithm to choose from a large set of conformations an ensemble for which the in silico back calculated data fit all available experimental_data since its first version we have developed a more robust algorithm enhanced the sampling of conformational_space and expanded the types of experimental_data used applications of ensemble to the unfolded_state of the drkn sh_domain and the intrinsically_disordered states of the cell_cycle protein sic and various protein_phosphatase regulators have also been described importantly using crossvalidation and synthetic experimental restraints calculated from simulated ensembles we demonstrated that ensemble is capable of accurate modeling of the secondary_structure molecular size_distribution and tertiary contacts of disordered proteins if sufficient data is incorporated tertiary_structure in particular is highly dependent on the number of distance_restraints used most recently we have significantly_improved the user_interface and the stability of the program thus we are now making the first official distribution version available online at http abragam med utoronto ca jfklab
