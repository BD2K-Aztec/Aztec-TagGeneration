pathway analysis of high_throughput within a bayesian_network framework motivation most current approaches to high_throughput htbd analysis either perform individual gene protein analysis or gene protein set enrichment_analysis for a list of biologically_relevant molecules bayesian_networks bns capture linear_and interactions handle stochastic events accounting for noise and focus on local_interactions which can be related to causal_inference here we describe for the first time an algorithm that models biological_pathways as bns and identifies pathways that best explain given htbd by scoring fitness of each network results proposed method takes_into the connectivity and relatedness between nodes of the pathway through factoring pathway topology in its model our simulations using synthetic data demonstrated robustness of our approach we tested proposed method bayesian pathway analysis bpa on human microarray_data regarding renal_cell rcc and compared our results with gene_set bpa was able to find broader and more specific pathways related to rcc availability accompanying bpa software bpas package is freely_available for academic use at http high_throughput htbd are generated in a variety of ways including through deep_sequencing and microarrays these data can provide a snapshot of regulatory_processes in the cell by inferring gene_networks from experimental_data in particular bayesian_network bn models have gained popularity for the task of learning biological_pathways from microarray_gene in gene network modeling studies using bns nodes generally represent expression_level of a gene and edges represent relationship between genes bn models capture both linear_and interactions between sets of random_variables and handle stochastic events in a probabilistic_framework accounting for noise this results in the emphasis of only to whom correspondence should be addressed the strong relations in the observed data bns are therefore viable candidates for modeling gene_regulation systems where stochastic effects and large_amounts of noise are expected furthermore bns are able to focus on local_interactions where each node is directly_affected by a relatively small number of nodes and interactions defined by a bn can be related to causal_inference these properties are similarly observed in biological_networks justifying the use of bns in exploring pathways in the setting of gene_interaction using htbd arguably the most popular htbd type is microarrays where an identification_of between two groups of samples initially relied on individual gene analysis iga an alternative approach called pathway analysis functional_enrichment or gene_set gsa which focuses on directly determining predefined gene_sets or classes that are significantly regulated has received a great_deal gsa methods score groups of genes and can identify genes that exhibit subtle changes at an individual_level but show concordant enrichment within a set here we propose a new method of pathway analysis which uses a graph_theoretic approach and bn theory to evaluate whether a putative pathway successfully describes the underlying htbd previously described gsea or gene_ontology based_methods do not take into account the connectiveness of analyzed gene_lists there have been methods proposed to take into account the go graph topology overlap between go categories in the go hierarchy or modeling interactions between go categories in assessing the significance of enrichment of a go term based on experimental_data however none of these methods takes_into the network or structure defining the relation between the genes in each category the proposed method bayesian pathway analysis bpa considers the topology via which genes interact with each other when analyzing a group of genes using pathway_information from global databases we model each biological_pathway as a bn after merging repeating entries and if necessary solving for cyclicity while preserving the dependencies entailed by the original pathway we consider the resulting bn which is a graphical_representation of gene interactions rendered by the given pathway with non informal uniform belief priors we quantify the degree to which observed experimental_data fit this bn using bayesian dirichlet equivalent bde score calculation where the bn is updated with input datawe described a method that models biological_pathways as bns and determines the fitness of given microarray_data using bde score the proposed method overcomes representation mapping data discretization and cyclicity problems that arise in modeling pathways as bns we have chosen multinomial bns with dirichlet priors because i their posterior can be efficiently calculated in closed form ii they capture non linear interactions and iii they render a plain model requiring less parameter adjustment moreover algorithms scoring mutinomial bns have low time complexity alternative_models such as linear gaussian models gaussian_process networks or regression_models are usually preferred in the task of structure_learning linear gaussian models and regression_models in bn setting can only detect linear dependencies between the child and parent variables in gaussian_process bn models gaussian_process priors are used as parametric families to model non linear relations however the problem then becomes one of selecting the best fitting covariance function and the number of its hyperparameters in gaussian_process modeling which requires various approximations and assumptions that may not be suitable in htbd settings rcc represents a spectrum of genetically_diverse epithelial_tumors with a common derivation from the renal tubular_epithelium and a variable clinical course approximately of cases present with metastatic_disease at initial diagnosis and of initially organ_confined cases develop metastases during later follow_up since there are no reliable biomarkers available patient management remains problematic despite improving understanding of the underlying_molecular in particular treatment of advanced rcc still poses a great challenge as the rcc is resistant to chemoand radiation_therapy and cytokine based therapies offer only low clinical response_rates with considerable toxicity the advent of targeted_therapy has brought exciting therapeutic_options with promising_clinical although the clinical_benefit with respect to overall survival is only marginal however high_throughput that analyze the entire_genome and proteome promise to elucidate the heterogeneity of this disease and eventually enable a patient tailored individualized treatment in contrast to the analysis of single genes gene pathways enable us to see the context of complex interactions and to understand the biologic relevance page
