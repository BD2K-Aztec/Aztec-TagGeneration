gene_expression modeling time dependent_transcription effects of her oncogene and discovery of a role for e f in breast_cancer cell_matrix motivation oncogenes are known drivers of cancer phenotypes and targets of molecular_therapies however the complex and diverse sig naling mechanisms regulated by oncogenes and potential routes to targeted therapy_resistance remain to be fully understood to this end we present an approach to infer regulatory_mechanisms downstream of the her driver oncogene in sum metastatic_breast from dynamic gene_expression using a succession of analytical_techniques including a novel mp grammars method to mathematically model putative regulatory_interactions among sets of clustered genes results our method highlighted regulatory_interactions previously_identified in the cell_line and a novel finding that the her oncogene as opposed to the proto_oncogene upregulates expression of the e f transcription_factor by targeted gene_knockdown we show the significance of this demonstrating that cancer cell_matrix and outgrowth were markedly_inhibited when e f levels were reduced thus validating in this context that upregulation of e f represents a key intermediate event in a her oncogene directed gene_expression based signaling circuit this work demonstrates how predictive_modeling of longitudinal gene_expression data combined with multiple systems level analyses can be used to accurately_predict downstream_signaling here our integrated method was applied to reveal insights as to how the her oncogene drives a specific cancer cell phenotype but it is adaptable to investigate other oncogenes and model systems availability_and accessibility of various tools is listed in methods the log gain stoichiometric stepwise algorithm is accessible at http www cbmc it software software php cancer_cells demonstrate unlimited and unmitigated proliferation and resistance to anti_proliferative and cell_death cues phenotypes that set them apart from normal cells underlying these cancer specific phenotypes are aberrantly activated reconfigured signaling_networks that control malignant_growth and survival cancer specific signaling_networks and carcinogenesis are governed by the activation of key cancer_driver termed oncogenes based on this understanding much progress has been made to develop anti_cancer with great clinical gains made through efforts to target oncogenes that possess kinase function including the epidermal_growth family_member her in the treatment of breast_cancer bc the advantages of molecularly_targeted systemic_treatments over traditional chemotherapy are clear targeted treatments yield improved_patient and lesser side_effects despite advancements made to improve cancer_treatments targeted_therapies eventually fail for patients leading to developed drug_resistance and cancer_recurrence a number of molecular_mechanisms are described to underlie de_novo and developed resistance to drugs included among them is the event of an activating mutation in an effector_protein downstream of the targeted oncogenic kinase the complexity of oncogene_activation and the prevalence of resistance underscore the fact that although it is appreciated that activated oncogenes are the dominant drivers of malignant_progression in cancer it remains_unclear how activated oncogenes regulate the expression of transformed phenotypes beyond well studied biochemical signaling_pathways it is especially true for yet unknown transcriptional_regulatory clearly elucidating the signaling_networks regulated by oncogenes that result in cancer specific phenotypes will provide insight to improve therapeutic_strategies and overcome resistance to this end biological_processes are increasingly being described by network modeling of gene_expression data various approaches have been used for purposes of investigating transcription networks to identify expression based_classifiers for cancer_subtypes or to integrate dna level genetic_variation and expression data to infer to whom correspondence should be addressed causality or to model before and after perturbation expression data to infer causality in step with these efforts an ever increasing variety of formalisms have been proposed for modeling and simulating gene_interaction here we developed a multi pronged_approach to investigate her oncogene signaling_mechanisms using perturbed timedependent gene_expression data from microarray_analysis at this stage in the development of our modeling system clustering of genes was required to reduce the dimensionality or complexity of the data our working premises were that genes displaying similar dynamic_patterns of expression are similarly_regulated and functionally_related a concept supported in the literature and furthermore that the expression_level changes of a gene or genes in one cluster impacts the expression_level changes of genes in another we started with a method to cluster genes displaying similar expression dynamics after her oncogene signaling was inhibited in the her amplified metastatic bc cell_line sum then we derived mathematical_models to support predicted regulatory_relationships among clusters using a novel mp grammars method which identifies algebraic notation that can simulate the dynamics of one cluster as a function of the gene expression_level changes displayed by another cluster here we have adapted the application of p systems that was developed for the purpose of expressing metabolic systems in discrete mathematical terms a promoter analysis reinforced indications for relationships between clusters a pathway impact analysis was used to identify cancer pathways functions specific to a clustered gene_set all told the analysis predicted a key intermediary role for the e f transcription_factor e f in her oncogene signaling in follow_up functional studies to test the prediction targeted e f expression knockdown and d on top matrigel assays showed that matrix adhesion and outgrowth which is indicative of cancer cell potential for metastatic colonization was significantly_inhibited in sum cells when e f levels were reduced the success of driver oncogene targeted therapeutic_strategies can be attributed to the fact that oncogene directed signaling promotes the many phenotypes that define the patho biology of cancer_cells termed the hallmarks of cancer that include among others unrestricted growth immune system evasion metabolic transformation cancer cell tumorigenicity and the various stages of metastases the challenge_remains to understand the specifics for oncogene directed signaling_processes that contribute to each of these phenotypes in earlier work using engineered cell_lines to identify genes whose expression is regulated by the driver her oncogene versus the proto_oncogene we explored gene_expression dynamics using a bayesian clustering method this previous analysis revealed overlapping and unique clusters of genes for each condition suggesting that driver oncogenes engage unique regulatory_mechanisms that cause distinguishing gene_expression dynamics and signaling circuits in cancer_cells the work presented here represents considerably advanced efforts to discover unknown regulatory paths in transcription programs the use of cell_lines where thethe effect of e f knockdown in sum cells cultured on matrigel e f knockdown caused a marked reduction in viable colony numbers and size magnification the figure is representative of two independent experiments in triplicate viable cells were stained dark purple with mtt dimethylthiazol_yl diphenyltetrazolium_bromide reagent c quantitation of the effect of e f knockdown in sum cells cultured on matrigel the graph shows the total number of viable transduced colonies per well of a well plate results are the mean of three biological_replicates and representative of replicated experiments bars sd gene annotated her oncogene regulated signaling circuits predicted by the proposed network model the indicated genes and their role in her oncogene signaling are supported by previously published_data blue or as in the case of e f they are supported by computational and in vivo cell_biology experiments presented in this study orange black arrows indicate that according to our data the gene_expression was upregulated up arrow or downregulated down arrow by her signalingfunctional status of her is known is necessary to distinguish and model gene_expression features that were regulated directly_or by her driver oncogene function time course perturbation studies were used because rigorous statistical_analyses of gene_expression changes over time can be applied to filter noise also algorithms that reverse_engineer gene_networks from dynamic gene_expression data outperform classic clustering_algorithms polynomial models were used for the purpose of curve_fitting analysis and were also used in the calculation of the eight clusters all necessary to reduce data complexity this methodology might be improved by using more complex clustering_algorithms based on machine_learning such as hidden_markov or support_vector which hold_potential to distinguish more refined clusters nevertheless in the present iteration our approach using simple polynomial models to investigate her oncogene signaling_networks in sum bc cells resulted in a model with features that were concordant with both previous reported results and data from patient tumors the integration of various analytical_tools such as impact factor_analysis biobase explain and oncomine with the results of mp grammar modeling supported specific predicted regulatory_circuits and pointed to novel insights surrounding oncogene regulation of p mapk aldh a and e f genes in the her amplified bc derived cell_line definitive contributions of this study are that her driver oncogene signaling upregulated the expression of e f and that e f potentiated the her oncogene signal for maintaining a transformed phenotype the overwhelming focus of existing_literature surrounding the e f family_of has characterized their function as master_regulators of cell_proliferation but chen and his colleagues are correct to point out that knowledge is lacking as to the biological_processes that they collectively or individually regulate in cancer among the limited literature specifically on e f and its aberrant role in bc work byshowed that an e f activation signature correlates with resistance to anti estrogen_treatment for estrogen_receptor er positive bc the study herein now indicates the importance of e f in a novel her oncogene directed signaling_pathway where her oncogeneregulated e f expression impacts cell_matrix function with potential_consequences for metastatic colonization another consideration arising from our study surrounds the nature of oncogene_activation and the status of her as a driver oncogene simply overexpressing the her oncogene in the non transformed mcf a cell did not cause the dominant regulatory effect for her action on e f expression as seen in sum cells these observations support the concept that the status and function of a driver oncogene is not simply the result of signal_amplification but that additional context dependent_variables are involved to evoke aberrant pathway signaling
