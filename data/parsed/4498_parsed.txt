swispot modeling riboswitches by spotting out switching sequences motivation riboswitches are cis_regulatory in mrna mostly found in bacteria which exhibit two main secondary_structure conformations although one of them prevents the gene from being expressed the other conformation allows its expression and this switching process is typically driven by the presence of a specific_ligand although there are a handful of known ribos witches our knowledge in this field has been greatly limited due to our inability to identify their alternate structures from their sequences indeed current methods are not able to predict the presence of the two functionally_distinct conformations just from the knowledge of the plain rna nucleotide_sequence whether this would be possible for which cases and what prediction_accuracy can be achieved are currently open questions results here we show that the two alternate secondary_structures of riboswitches can be accurately_predicted once the switching sequence of the riboswitch has been properly identified the proposed swispot approach is capable of identifying the switching sequence inside a putative complete riboswitch sequence on the basis of pairing behaviors which are evaluated on proper sets of configurations moreover it is able to model the switching behavior of riboswitches whose generated ensemble covers both alternate configurations beyond structural predictions the approach can also be paired to homology_based riboswitch searches availability_and swispot software along with the reference dataset files is available atgene regulation is essential to achieve organism versatility giving cells control over structure and functions and being the basis for cellular_differentiation morphogenesis and adaptability since the discovery of ribozymes it has become more and more evident that rna_molecules are also actively involved in regulatory_mechanisms including the regulation of gene_expression riboswitches are rna_elements mainly found in bacteria that are embedded in untranslated_regions of mrna they are able to sense cellular_metabolites with no involvement of protein factors and consequently modulate either mrna_transcription or translation by adopting one out of two possible structures known as on and off conformations riboswitches are usually built around an aptamer domain which binds to the ligand and an expression platform domain which undergoes a structural_rearrangement upon the ligandaptamer binding furthermore a central role in regulation has been recognized to an overlapping region between these two domains referred to as switching sequence or swseq for short hereafter from an evolutionary standpoint aptamers are typically highly_conserved as a consequence of its recognition specificity towards the ligand in contrast expression platforms are usually far less conserved previous_works have shown that riboswitches can regulate_gene via three main mechanisms i transcription_termination through the formation of a terminator hairpin or a competitive antiterminator structure ii translation_inhibition by sequestering or releasing the shine_dalgarno sd sequence and iii alternative_splicing regulation via sequestration release of alternative_splicing sites understanding the mechanisms of riboswitch structural switching is of broad interest and applicable to a wide_range of scientific fields such as systems_biology or drug_design e g to design novel engineered genetic_circuits or develop riboswitch targeting_drugs previous computational efforts targeting riboswitches can be categorized in riboswitch gene_finders and conformational switch predictors the former category includes several tools such as infernal the founding component of the rfam database and more specific tools such as ribex abreu or ribosw such methods are primarily used for genome_wide analyses and are based on machine_learning the second category encompasses various methods based on a structural_classification of alternative structures such as parnass rnashapes and rnabor family specific approaches for on off structure_prediction have been employed as well here we present a novel computational_method that can predict the two functional conformations of riboswitches using merely as input the plain rna nucleotide_sequence importantly this developed procedure can also be coupled with a classifier to identify putative riboswitch sequences i e to uncover riboswitches based on its potential to generate two alternate configurations the method presented here is capable of predicting the presence of a riboswitchincluding its two alternate conformationsusing as input only its nucleotide_sequence the procedure consists in three major_steps including i prediction of the switching sequence swseq ii prediction of the alternate secondary_structure conformations and iii scoring and consequent classification of the sequence as a putative riboswitch the proposed approach has been tested on the reference dataset obtaining the results reported in supplementary table s moreover it has been used to investigate a complete set of annotated putative riboswitches from the rfam database rfam our method is fully applicable to any prokaryotic organism at a genome_wide level targeting single sequences up to nt each several methods for riboswitch prediction have been proposed which are based either on predicting the presence of conformational switches or on predicting riboswitches using homology_based searches however none of the current methods is focused on predicting the two riboswitch conformational structures such a capability would be extremely useful in driving riboswitch engineering and for synthetic_biology for this reason we propose swispot a novel computational_method to directly address conformational prediction of riboswitches the scarceness of precise data on riboswitch conformations makes it impossible to build a riboswitch predictor that merely uses a statistical or machine_learning approach despite the mentioned data shortage a reference dataset has been defined to properly assess the proposed approach the proposed modeling effort stems from the first significant result presented in this work we find a strong computational evidence of the role of the switching sequence in the characterisation of the whole riboswitch system moreover we find that the switching sequence incorporates most of the information required to drive the switching mechanisms the novelty of our approach relies on the ability to locate switching sequences which are then used to predict the alternative conformations and to finally classify the target rna_sequence as a riboswitch or not notably previous genome_wide methods to search for riboswitches only looked for aptamer motifs thus completely ignoring structural predictions on the other hand we show that swispot can be paired to these methods leading to more reliablernabor results run on the same sequence show only one peak for the off structure a smaller peak with partially free sd is present predictions of putative riboswitches importantly from this experience we observe that the quality of results depends on the capability of selecting the proper subsequence to analyze around the aptamer down to the expression platform and not beyond lessons_learned in using the proposed algorithms indicate possible future improvements although apparently difficult to apply neglecting the energy contribution of the ligand and kinetic cotranscriptional aspects of the folding_process can likely lead to biased samplings of the energy_landscapes where conformations similar to both the alternative structures are not adequately represented this issue could be addressed by introducing additional diverse forms of sampling unfortunately the lack of real structural data prevents any solid assessment of this kind of improvement furthermore the limitation of excluding pseudoknots could be removed devising new algorithms for the swseq extractor and the constrained folder future work will investigate possible improvements within each single module as well as the provision of new functionalities in additional modules
