systems_biology pathway hunting by random survival forests motivation pathway or gene_set has been widely_applied to genomic_data many current pathway testing methods use univariate test_statistics calculated from individual genomic markers which ignores the correlations and interactions between candidate markers random_forests based pathway analysis is a promising approach for incorporating complex correlation and interaction_patterns but one limitation of previous_approaches is that pathways have been considered separately thus pathway cross_talk information was not considered results in this article we develop a new pathway hunting algorithm for survival_outcomes using random survival forests which prioritize important pathways by accounting for gene correlation and genomic interactions we show that the proposed method performs favourably compared with five popular pathway testing methods using both synthetic and real_data we find that the proposed methodology provides an efficient and powerful pathway modelling framework for high_dimensional genomic_data high_throughput such as gene_expression single_nucleotide and next_generation have revolutionized biological and medical_research by making it possible to measure thousands to millions of biomarkers across the genome simultaneously however detecting meaningful signals and making appropriate inferences from these massive datasets remains_challenging because of the high_dimensionality and complex correlation and interactions that are at play to reduce dimensionality and to increase statistical_test power pathway or gene_set has become increasingly popular instead of applying statistical_tests to one gene at a time pathway analysis takes advantages of previous biological_knowledge and examines the gene_expression of a group of related genes e g grouped by biological_functions for their associations with disease outcomes since the well known gene_set gsea method was published a number of pathway analysis approaches have been developed including parametric_analysis of gene_set averaged t statistic gene_set scores the maxmean statistic for improved gsea the random sets method mixed_effects and principal_components web_based pathway tools such as david genetrail and the online gsea interface at the broad institute are also widely used although pathway analyses are designed to test effects from multiple genes in place of single genes typically they rely on test_statistics based on simple summary_statistics e g the mean of individual genes that ignore correlation between genes and more importantly genegene_interactions recent genomic studies have demonstrated the importance of genegene_interactions and gene_networks for complex_diseases that are not being addressed with these methods one recent pathway analysis method for modelling genegene relationships makes use of random_forests rf by constructing rf for genes in each pathway and ranking pathways based on prediction_accuracy this method automatically incorporates two way or high order genes interactions effects with marginal association patterns however a limitation of these rf pathway approaches is that they ignore genes outside of the targeted pathway complex_diseases often result from multiple pathway disturbances and interactions a well known example is the ras pathway which activates multiple signalling_pathways to drive uncontrolled proliferation in cancer therefore a single pathway may not fully explain phenotype variations in complex_diseases goeman anddiscussed the need to include genes outside the gene_sets for pathway testing and they indicated these should be dependent on biological hypothesis the ideal solution is to combine all available candidate pathway gene_expression data together for rf modelling however finding a reliable gene importance measure for ultra high_dimensional genomic_data and resolving the computational issues in rf are challenging in this article we propose a new pathway hunting algorithm for survival_outcomes using random survival forests rsf that prioritize important pathways by accounting for transcriptome wise gene

testing approaches have been developed because of computational and statistical modelling challenges the information from genegene_interactions are either ignored or restricted to within an individual

on a new measure of variable_importance termed minimal depth which has been shown to be an efficient and effective method for variable_selection in high_dimensions our rsf pathway hunting approach is
