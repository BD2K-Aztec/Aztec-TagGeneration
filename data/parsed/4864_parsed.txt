genetics_and virvarseq a low_frequency virus variant detection pipeline for illumina_sequencing using adaptive base_calling accuracy filtering motivation in virology massively_parallel mps opens many opportunities for studying viral quasi species e g in hiv and hcv_infected patients this is essential for understanding pathways to resistance which can substantially_improve treatment although mps platforms allow in depth characterization of sequence_variation their measurements still involve substantial technical noise for illumina_sequencing single base_substitutions are the main error source and impede powerful assessment of low_frequency mutations fortunately base calls are complemented with quality_scores qs that are useful for differentiating errors from the real low_frequency mutations results a variant_calling tool q cpileup is proposed which exploits the qs of nucleotides in a filtering strategy to increase specificity the tool is imbedded in an open_source pipeline virvarseq which allows variant_calling starting from fastq_files using both plasmid mixtures and clinical samples we show that q cpileup is able to reduce the number of false_positive the filtering strategy is adaptive and provides an optimized threshold for individual samples in each sequencing run additionally linkage information is kept between single_nucleotide as variants are called at the codon level this enables virologists to have an immediate biological_interpretation of the reported variants with respect to their antiviral drug_responses a comparison with existing snp caller tools reveals that calling variants at the codon level with q cpileup results in an outstanding sensitivity while maintaining a good specificity for variants with frequencies down to rna_viruses such as hiv and hcv exist in their host as complex populations composed of several closely_related subgroups they are referred to as quasi species and originate from high and error_prone replication rates this heterogeneous mixture of genomes allows a viral_population to rapidly adapt to changing environments the fittest mutants outcompete the others allowing the virus to develop resistance to antiviral_therapy the characterization of sequence_variation within the viral_population is key for understanding pathways to resistance but the identification of low_frequency variants remains_challenging until recently the genetic_diversity of a virus population could be assessed only through genotyping by sanger_sequencing which provides information on only the most abundant viral_variants massively_parallel allow for a more in depth characterization of sequence_variation including low_frequency viral_strains however their measurements still involve substantial technical noise complicating the analysis pyrosequencing commercialized by roche was the most common sequencing method for viral_population sequencing the recent announcement by roche to retract the technology from the market by mid illustrates the pressing need to evaluate and implement alternative technologies recently illuminas sequencing technique has strengthened its position in this field thys et_al manuscript under review illumina also complements the sequenced nucleotides with quality_scores qs that reflect the basecalling substitution error probability the qs however do not have such an intuitive interpretation filtering based on qs has already proven valuable to reduce false_positive it often involves the use of a hard quality threshold unfortunately this does not account for variation in quality between runs resulting in too stringent or too relaxed thresholds most variant_calling tools focus on the detection of single_nucleotide snps or perform haplotype reconstruction haplotype_assembly has to whom correspondence should be addressed its weakness in the detection of low_frequency variants whereas the latter is our main interest instead we prefer to call variants within the read_length to avoid challenges encountered in the haplotype reconstruction on the other hand linkage between the nucleotides is lost when calling variants at the snp level in this contribution we introduce a novel strategy for calling variants at the codon level nucleotide triplets which facilitates immediate biological interpretations particularly in virology applications where drug target_regions are of interest in this article we present an innovative approach for variant_calling at the codon level named q cpileup that reduces the number of false_positive by exploiting the qs of the nucleotides generated by sequencing our thresholding strategy is adaptive to provide an optimized threshold for individual samples in each sequencing run q cpileup is imbedded in a pipeline called virvarseq which starts from fastq_files many sequence variant identification tools have been described in literature to call variants at the snp level most approaches are tailored to call snps in human resequencing projects where snps can be either heterologous or homologous however in viral deep sequencing_projects the snp frequency can vary between and whereas snps present in of the reads also may be of interest further our main focus is the detection of drugresistant variants for which a specific drug target_region has to be investigated hence it would be beneficial to report variants at the codon level per amino_acid position to enable an immediate biological_interpretation of the variants with respect to their antiviral drug_responses variant_calling tools used by the virologists in this research field are either not fully described in house tools noguera julian et_al or build based on snps at the dna or rna level only in the latter case one needs to retrieve the linkage information between the neighboring nucleotides to deduce effects at the coded amino_acid level this process is not always straightforward some of the variant callers developed for viral_population sequencing have add on tools like v profiler for v phaser to convert the list of snps to a list of codon variants however these are mainly developed for data none of the available tools reports the variants immediately at the codon level therefore q cpileup was initially_developed and imbedded in a pipeline by taking the weakest link as a representative for the quality of the codon the filtering remains at the individual nucleotide level but reporting is done at the codon level the approach is adaptive to allow for differences in quality between the runs the intersection point between the distributions of the errors and reliable calls is suggested as a threshold qit however other criteria could also be considered for instance the number of false_discoveries can be controlled by defining the qit as a certain quantile of the reliable call component distribution by using the quantile as a qit of the codons which are truly present in the population are falsely considered as being errors this statement relies heavily on the interpretation of the distributions as errors and reliable calls however the three component mixture distribution should be considered only as a working assumption moreover it is impossible to check the actual interpretation of the mixture distributions hence the interpretation of the different components as error and reliable calls cannot always be warranted particularly when low qs are underrepresented therefore we advise users to assess the distribution plots as diagnostic_tools to critically judge whether the chosen threshold is acceptable and or meaningful instead of applying hard filtering with a qit as suggested in this article the posterior_probabilities of the reliable call distribution could be used the counts of a codon at a particular position can be weighted with these probabilities by doing so codons with a low q will have a low contribution in the final frequency estimates hence data are not filtered but weighted with the probabilities of being truly present in the reliable codon population this method also relies on the interpretation of the different component distributions as error_distribution and reliable call distribution importantly we have shown that the filtering strategy using hard threshold qit is robust to runs where the distributions deviate from the working assumption the impact on the final codon table frequencies was minimal overall our proposed filtering strategy controls the false_positive at reasonable levels with no false_discoveries above a reporting limit of the noise is effectively reduced while retaining the reliable calls even at low_frequency this suggests that the reporting limit of detection at could be lowered although distinguishing true variants from error at remains_challenging depending on the risk one is willing to take to include a small number of false_positive either one of the cutoffs can be used more importantly q cpileup shows a splendid sensitivity that could not be achieved by the snp callers while maintaining a good specificity for variants with frequencies down to this sensitivity will allow further investigation of the reported variants above one of the cutoffs defined by the specificity to search for resistance associated mutations or in the next step to monitor drug_resistance and guide treatment dierynck et_al submitted for publication currently the clinical cutoff is not yet defined for minority drugresistant virus variants and it is still a subject of open debate some studies have found no significant association between the presence of low_frequency variants and subsequent virological_failure whereas others report clear correlations the availability of methods that detect low_frequency variants at the codon level with high_sensitivity and good specificity can help in defining the clinical_benefit of low_frequency resistance_testing a variant_calling tool is proposed for identifying true variants at the codon level within a viral_population using illumina_sequencing the variants are filtered using base_calling qs for reducing false_positive the lowest q of the three nucleotides of the codon is taken as representative for the codon an adaptive strategy is developed to provide an optimized threshold for individual samples in each sequencing run the intersection point of the component distributions of the mixture is suggested as a valuable threshold qit codons with a q below this threshold are not reported the robustness against deviations of the working assumption justifies the utilities of our method for low and high_quality sequencing runs it is shown that the generated filtered codon table is reporting far fewer false_positive compared with the codon table based on the raw_data moreover virvarseq has a superb sensitivity compared with existing snp callers while maintaining a good specificity for codon variants with frequencies down to this suggests that the current reporting limit of detection at can even be lowered the tool is implemented in a userfriendly open_source pipeline virvarseq which allows virologists to call variants at the codon level starting from the fastq_files
