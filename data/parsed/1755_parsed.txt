systems_biology fast and efficient dynamic nested effects models_motivation targeted interventions in combination with the measurement of secondary_effects can be used to computationally reverse_engineer features of upstream non transcriptional signaling_cascades nested effect models nems have been introduced as a statistical_approach to estimate the upstream signal flow from downstream nested subset structure of perturbation_effects the method was substantially extended later on by several authors and successfully_applied to various datasets the connection of nems to bayesian_networks and factor graph models has been highlighted results here we introduce a computationally attractive extension of nems that enables the analysis of perturbation time series data hence allowing to discriminate between direct and indirect signaling and to resolve feedback_loops reverse_engineering of biological_networks is a key for the understanding of biological_systems the exact knowledge of interdependencies between proteins in the living_cell is crucial for the identification of drug_targets for various diseases however due to the complexity of the system a complete picture with detailed knowledge of the behavior of individual proteins is still out of reach nonetheless the advent of gene perturbation techniques like rna_interference rnai opened new perspectives for network_reconstruction by boosting the ability to subject organisms to well defined interventions in general biological_networks are represented mathematically by a graph in which the nodes represent biological_entities and the edges encode functional_relations of various kinds between these entities a number of approaches have been proposed in the literature for estimating networks from perturbation_effects many of these aim at reconstructing a network from directly observable effects for example build a directed disruption graph by drawing an edge i j if gene i results in a significant expression to whom correspondence should be addressed change at gene j uses such disruption networks as a starting_point for a further graph_theoretic method which removes indirect_effects hence making the network more parsimonious enhance this approach by additionally making use of edge probabilities and signs to make the network consistent with the observed biological_effects moreover bayesian_networks have been used to model the statistical dependency between perturbation experiments for this purpose pearl introduces his do calculus an idealized model of interventions other probabilistic_graphical that have been proposed to model interventional data comprise factor graphs and dependency networks in genetics epistasis_analysis is often been applied for learning from indirect downstream_effects for example use expression_profiles from single and double knockdowns to partly reconstruct a developmental_pathway in dictyostelium_discoideum via a simple cluster_analysis embedds epistasis_analysis into a statistical_framework propose a special kind of bayesian_network to infer pathway structures from genetic_interaction data all of these approaches deal with static data however with the increasing availability of time resolved data it is desirable and helpful to model the temporal aspects of signaling to this end differential_equation systems have been suggested e g by our approach is an expansion of nested effects models nems nems are specifically_designed to learn the signaling flowon a transcriptional as well as non transcriptional levelbetween perturbed genes from indirect high_dimensional effects typically monitored by dna_microarrays nems use a graphical modeling framework to compare a given network hypothesis with the observed nested structure of downstream_effects in conclusion nems estimate an interaction_network between hidden entities from a set of observable downstream_effects nems have been applied successfully to a number of datasets e g the immune_response in drosophila_melanogaster a transcription_factor network in saccharomices cerevisiae the er pathway in human_breast a synthetic_lethality interactions network in s cerevisiae murine stem_cell development in mice and the rosetta dataset for s cerevisiae page we developed a novel approach to infer signaling_cascades from high_dimensional perturbation time series measurements via dynonems hence allowing to discriminate direct from indirect perturbation_effects and to resolve feedback_loops our approach directly extends the nems framework introduced bythe static to the dynamic case by unrolling the network_structure over time this idea allows for a fast and efficient computation of the likelihood_function without any time consuming gibbs_sampling our simulations revealed a high_accuracy of network_reconstruction for sufficiently small networks up to nodes thanks to the incorporated network_structure prior we achieved a consistantly high_specificity i e low false_positive applying our dynonems to estimate the network between six proteins five transcription_factors playing a key role in murine stem_cell development we found a good agreement with results published by achang et_al and with the biological_literature we therefore believe that our approach can serve as a useful tool to generate datadriven hypotheses about signaling and or transcriptional_networks based on high_dimensional perturbation_effects
