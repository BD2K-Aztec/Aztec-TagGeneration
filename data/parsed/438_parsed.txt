application of canonical_correlation for identifying viral integration preferences motivation gene_therapy aims at using viral_vectors for attaching helpful genetic_code to target_genes therefore it is of great_importance to develop methods that can discover significant patterns around viral_integration canonical_correlation is an unsupervised statistical tool that is used to describe the relations between two related views of the same semantic object which fits well for identifying such salient patterns results proposed method is demonstrated on a sequence_dataset obtained from a study on hiv preferred integration regions the subsequences on the left and right sides of the integration points are given to the method as the two views and statistically_significant relations are found between sequence driven features derived from these two views which suggest that the viral preference must be the factor responsible for this correlation we found that there are significant correlations at x indicating a palindromic behavior surrounding the viral integration_site which complies with the previously_reported results availability developed software_tool is available atadvances in genome sequencing_technologies provided scientists determine target_sites of viruses in human_genome this concept has brought along an innovative step called gene_therapy in gene_therapy connection parts of viruses to genome which are called as ltrs long_terminal are used for linking helpful genetic_code to target_gene however in order to understand linking characteristics of such a vector to a target_gene first a cell of host_genome must be infected with a virus having proper ltr this methodology has been applied to one of the most popular gene_therapy challenges hiv human_immunodeficiency infected a human lymphoid cell_line with hiv based vector and obtained chimeric sites after transcriptional_profiling they showed a correlation between gene activity and viral insertion preference a hot_spot covering a region of kb was reported to include only of these sites to whom correspondence should be addressed after sequencing phase virus specific patterns motifs can arise in chimeric sequences in order to detect such common patterns a numerous types of motif search approaches have been proposed described a series of components to determine alignments of multiple_sequences they derived log_likelihood scoring_schemes and then implemented a greedy_algorithm for finding alignments of functionally_related sequences in another study presented a gibbs samplingbased method to discover and weigh binding_site patterns in dna_sequences manually identified symmetrical palindromic behavior between the frequencies of bases on each side of integration sites in hiv consensus_sequences reported by in this study in order to find such common sequence_patterns automatically we propose a method based on the wellknown statistical tool called canonical_correlation cca cca seeks correlated functions covariates of two different but related views i e two sets of related variables the availability of such correlated functions of the two views of the same semantic object is likely to exist due to an underlying factor responsible for the correlation in relation to the problem of finding patterns around viral_integration we are given dna_sequences targeted by the virus as the semantic object two nearby windows placed on each sequence can be used as the two views where the fragments falling in windows are represented by some sequence driven features such as base dimer frequencies or a more sophisticated one such as moment descriptors and the correlation of the two functions over these views is expected to be due to the viral preference as the factor responsible for this correlation cca has proved to be a powerful method in previous_studies especially in gwas genome_wide have proposed a canonical correlation based u statistic metric to detect single_nucleotide snp based genegene co association in two sample case control datasets they explored its type_i through simulations on two real_datasets in another study have implemented cca to detect genetic_associations between snps and gene_expression levels by this methodology they claim to reduce the amount of necessary comparisons for large_scale genomic studies suggested using a sparse implementation of cca they divided their dataset into small_subsets of variables belonging to different types and performed variable_selection by maximizing the correlation between these subsets cca based
