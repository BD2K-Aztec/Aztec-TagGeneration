systems_biology modular model of tnf cytotoxicity motivation tumour_necrosis tnf initiates a complex series of biochemical_events in the cell upon binding to its type r receptor tnf r recent experimental work has unravelled the molecular regulation of the signalling complexes that lead either to cell_survival or death survival_signals are activated by direct binding of tnf to tnf r at the cell_membrane whereas apoptotic signals by endocytosed tnf tnf r complexes here we describe a reduced effective model with few free_parameters where we group some intricate mechanisms into effective modules that successfully describes this complex set of actions we study the parameter_space to show that the model is structurally stable and robust over a broad range of parameter_values results we use state of the art bayesian_methods a sequential monte_carlo sampler to perform inference of plausible values of the model_parameters from experimental_data as a result we obtain a robust model that can provide a solid basis for further modelling of tnf signalling the model is also suitable for inclusion in multi_scale simulation programs that are presently under development to study the behaviour of large tumour cell_populations availability we provide supplementary_material that includes all mathematical details and all algorithms matlab_code and models sbml descriptions tumour_necrosis tnf is a cytokine that acts as a key_regulator of immune_functions tnf is the prototypical member of a growing family of cytokines but unlike the other members it can trigger intracellular signals that lead either to cell_survival and proliferation or death this dual role is important in the regulation of immune_response because it provides a molecular to whom correspondence should be addressed basis to cellular_homeostasis these opposing signals might lead to inhibition of tumour_growth or on the contrary to the promotion of tumour_development through direct see e g and indirect_mechanisms e g by tissue_remodelling and stromal development this motivates a detailed study of the molecular_mechanisms in tnf signalling many molecular actors of this complex intracellular machinery have been discovered and studied in a variety of cells see for a comprehensive_review this has attracted the attention of modellers who have attempted to unravel the switching mechanism that leads either to cell_survival or death using standard methods of systems_biology they have mostly stressed the interplay among intracellular molecules and the network of reactions stimulated by the binding of tnf to its type receptor tnf r recent data show that the path that leads to cell_survival is triggered by tnf binding to its receptor at the cell_membrane while the celldeath pathway is triggered by internalized tnf receptor_complexes here we focus on this important bifurcation and develop a reduced model of tnf action and we use modern statistical_techniques to estimate the model_parameters the modular model sketched in and defined by equations a g is a robust structurally stable description of the dual tnf action although it replaces an accurate description of known mechanisms with effective actions it provides a solid basis for more elaborate models it establishes kinetic bounds for modelpage we have computed the fraction of surviving cells has been computed after h of treatment for different initial tnf concentrations for all times the response to tnf has a nearly sigmoid shape this figure is reproduced at a larger scale in the supplementary_material supplementary parameters and helps understand the differences in sensitivity to tnf of various cell_lines the model is also suitable for integration into complex multi_scale simulation programs of tumour_growth such as vbl or other computational_models we plan to use the model to explore in detail the response of tumour_cell clusters to tnf therapy and to investigate tumour immune system interaction dynamics
