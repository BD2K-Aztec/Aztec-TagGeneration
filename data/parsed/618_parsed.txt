data_and automatic generation of bioinformatics_tools for predicting protein ligand_binding motivation predictive tools that model proteinligand binding on demand are needed to promote ligand research in an innovative drug_design environment however it takes considerable time and effort to develop predictive tools that can be applied to individual ligands an automated production pipeline that can rapidly and efficiently develop user_friendly proteinligand binding predictive tools would be useful results we developed a system for automatically generating proteinligand binding predictions implementation of this system in a pipeline of semantic_web technique based web_tools will allow users to specify a ligand and receive the tool within day we demonstrated high_prediction for three machine_learning and eight ligands availability_and the source_code and web_application are freely_available for download at http utprot net they are implemented in python and supported on linux the identification of proteinligand binding_sites is important for understanding protein_function many bioinformatics_methods have been proposed for ligand_binding identification or prediction computational_methods are useful because they can be applied rapidly and at low_cost compared with biochemical_experiments they have a wide_range in enzyme design drug_discovery chemical genetics and other fields the ligand_binding prediction_methods can be classified into sequence_based and structure based_methods with high_throughput yielding large_amounts of sequence_data sequence_based can be applied to a wide_range of proteins even those whose structures have not been determined and can be used for genome_wide analysis in this study we focused on sequence_based when the structure of a target protein is known structurebased methods can achieve high_accuracy however if modeled structures are used additional computation time is required and accuracy depends on model quality the critical assessment of protein_structure casp and the continuous automated model evaluation cameo are world_wide experiments for protein_structure and they have the category of ligand_binding many structure based or model based prediction_methods have been assessed in this category some structure based_methods use structure similarity to template libraries cofactor threads the structure through the biolip protein_function database using local and global structure matches to identify functional sites and homologies we present a user_friendly automatic production pipeline for proteinligand binding_site predictive tools using multi omics big_data the pipelines core data is organized by ontology as an evidence implementation of this system in a pipeline of semantic_web technology based web_tools allow users to specify a ligand and receive the tool within day we have demonstrated its high_prediction for several ligands the present pipeline system has backend linked open data comprising billion triples as an rdf graph it is available as a web_application that can be accessed and used at url http utprot net utprot galaxy we evaluated the software by automatically generating binding_site predictors for eight types of ligand using svm and ga based parameter_optimization we also evaluated performance for three types of ligand and three machine_learning svm rf and nns and two parameter optimization_methods ga based and grid_search we are now developing methods to extract only biologically_relevant ligands in this study we excluded only ligands that are apparently buffer media used for crystallization a general method that accommodates similarity among ligands should be designed our reasoning search of ligands based on ontology hierarchies partially addresses this need but more general ligand grouping based on stereochemistry or minor substituents can be conceived the combination of our system with homology_based or template based_methods is also a subject of future work the best parameters found are as this table the test_dataset was of the full dataset for each ligand and was same as used in
