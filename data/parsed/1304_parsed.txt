structural_bioinformatics defining and predicting structurally conserved_regions in protein superfamilies motivation the structures of homologous_proteins are generally better conserved than their sequences this phenomenon is demonstrated by the prevalence of structurally conserved_regions scrs even in highly_divergent protein_families defining scrs requires the comparison of two or more homologous structures and is affected by their availability and divergence and our ability to deduce structurally equivalent positions among them in the absence of multiple homolo gous structures it is necessary to predict scrs of a protein using information from only a set of homologous_sequences and if available a single structure accurate scr predictions can benefit homology_modelling and sequence_alignment results using pairwise dalilite alignments among a set of homolo gous structures we devised a simple measure of structural conservation termed structural conservation index sci sci was used to distinguish scrs from non scrs a database of scrs was compiled from scop superfamilies containing protein_domains artificial_neural were then trained to predict scrs with various features deduced from a single structure and homologous_sequences assessment of the predictions via a fold_cross method revealed that predictions based on features derived from a single structure perform similarly to ones based on homologous_sequences while combining sequence and structural_features was optimal in terms of accuracy and matthews correlation_coefficient these results suggest that even without information from multiple structures it is still possible to effectively predict scrs for a protein finally inspection of the structures with the worst predictions pinpoints difficulties in scr definitions availability the scr database and the prediction server can be found at http prodata swmed edu scr contact proteins descending from a common_ancestor usually conserve certain features of sequence structure or function these features can often be used to assess evolutionary_relationships although it is generally_accepted that high_sequence implies protein homology it is not uncommon for homologous_proteins to exhibit significant sequence_variability underscoring the need for additional ways to deduce homologous relationships in these cases the use of dimensional structures can aid homology inference as structures tend to be more conserved than sequences distantly_related proteins generally maintain similar structural folds and as a result a large fraction of regions e g can be structurally aligned even given very low sequence_identity e g therefore study of structurally conserved_regions scrs and structurally variable_regions svrs can help characterize protein_families and is useful in applications that rely on homology such as structure modelling and sequence_alignment scrs are generally characterized by but not limited to a set of key secondary_structures arranged in an overall topology shared by most members of a protein_family in practice scrs are usually deduced by aligning a set of two or more homologous structures and then inspecting which positions were alignable in the majority of the structures the number and divergence of available homologous structures can affect scr definition as a positive correlation exists between the fraction of structurally alignable parts and sequence_similarity the exact methodology of aligning structures also affects scr definition scr definitions have often relied on a structural superposition procedure that aims to optimize scoring_functions e g rmsd based on intermolecular distances of structurally equivalent residues a fixed distance cut_off is then selected to define all scrs however rigid structural alignment_methods based on minimizing intermolecular distances might be problematic because proteins are fairly elastic in evolution and can exhibit significant secondary_structure deformations shifts and rotations when divergent structures are compared therefore it has been noted that scrs defined with a fixed cut_off of intermolecular distance tend to underestimate structurally equivalent positions for divergent homologues extensions of these scrs with other geometric features such as backbone_conformations have been shown to improve the performance of comparative modelling more elastic alignment_methods to whom correspondence should be addressed such as those based on comparison of intramolecular contacts emphasize similarities in the local structural environment and allow deducing correspondences even for structural_elements with larger deviations although the number of solved structures is growing rapidly it still pales in comparison with the amount of available sequence_data there are still quite a number of protein_families with few or even no experimental_structures for these cases it is necessary to rely on predictive methods to identify scrs a few methods have been developed to predict the conservation of various structural_properties similar to scrs with measured success hydrophobicity plots and wavelet_analysis have been used to predict hydrophobic cores hydrophobic regions that determine the native like structure of a protein however hydrophobic cores do not comprise the entire set of scrs because not all structurally conserved_residues are buried within a hydrophobic environment in the megamotifbase database conserved structural_motifs were defined based on multiple homologous structures as short isolated fragments that exhibit both high sequence and structural conservation these structural_motifs were subsequently predicted without information about multiple structural homologues by using a neural_network ensemble however the structural_motifs in megamotifbase are different from general scrs which harbour residues that are not necessarily highly_conserved in terms of sequence in fact owing to the requirement of both sequence and structural conservation the fraction of residues in the motifs defined in megamotifbase is quite low as compared with the fraction of structurally conserved_residues in even highly_divergent protein_families to our knowledge methods for prediction of scrs in absence of multiple structures are currently not available in this work we approach the process of scr delineation as two separate challenges when a given protein_family has multiple known structures scrs can be defined by accurate structural_alignments however in the absence of structural homologues scrs can be predicted given information from a single structure and or homologous_sequences here based on dalilite alignments of homologous structures we introduce structural conservation index sci as a simple measure of positional structural conservation using sci we constructed a database of scrs found in scop superfamilies with five or more non redundant members this database was used to develop an scr predictor based on artificial_neural with inputs of various features derived in each case from homologous_sequences and at most a single structure we further analysed the results of scr predictions and identified common problems and difficulties in scr definitions
