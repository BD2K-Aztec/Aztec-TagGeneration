variantbam filtering and profiling of next generational sequencing_data using region specific rules we developed variantbam a c read filtering and profiling tool for use with bam cram and sam sequencing files variantbam provides a flexible framework for extracting sequencing_reads or read_pairs that satisfy combinations of rules defined by any number of genomic_intervals or variant sites we have implemented filters based on alignment data sequence_motifs regional coverage and base_quality for example variantbam achieved a median size reduction ratio of when applied to lung_cancer whole_genome bams by removing large tags and selecting for only high_quality variant supporting reads and reads matching a large dictionary of sequence_motifs thus variantbam enables efficient storage of sequencing_data while preserving the most relevant_information for downstream_analysis as the cost of genome_sequencing decreases the storage and computational_burden of handling large sequencing_datasets is an increasing concern whole_genome of a human_genome to coverage can result in approximately billion reads requiring more than gb of disk_space even in the compressed bam format to mitigate this the cram format was established to provide reference based compression of bam_files resulting in a reduction in file size however the cram format is not currently supported by many analysis tools and can still leave whole_genome files at coverage at gb an alternative is to create trimmed bam_files that contain only the sequence_information relevant for a particular set of scientific questions for instance one group may be interested in only mutations in exons while another may be interested in only reads that support structural_variants furthermore depending on the quality of the sequencing library a large fraction of the low quality reads can be removed with little effect on downstream_analyses even further reductions in size can be achieved by removing alignment tags or subsampling reads in areas of high coverage read filtering that meets all of these needs could reduce the data footprint while preserving the most relevant_information in a compact file the original bams could then be moved to low_cost archival storage or retained on an external server e g dbgap and filtered during retrieval read filtering can also be used directly in analysis_pipelines that operate only on a subset of reads research_questions in different fields e g epigenomics metagenomics etc will tend to focus onthese issues we developed variantbam a scriptable bam cram sam filtering tool designed to provide a robust and flexible method for retrieving custom sets of reads variantbam uses a hierarchical system of filtering rules to determine if a given read should be included in the output unique combinations of filtering rules can be applied to different genomic_intervals allowing for the needs of various analyses e g snps exon variants to be met with a single_pass through the sequencing file variantbam provides advanced filtering options not available through other filtering tools including motif matching to a dictionary of sequences cigar parsing considerations for base quality_scores and the ability to subsample to a maximum sequence_coverage variantbam is written in c and utilizes the rapid c htslib github com samtools htslib to perform i o with high_efficiency output to bam cram sam and standard output is supported
