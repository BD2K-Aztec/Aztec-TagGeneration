systems_biology robustness portraits of diverse biological_networks conserved despite order of magnitude parameter_uncertainty motivation biological_networks are robust to a wide_variety of internal and external_perturbations yet fragile or sensitive to a small minority of perturbations due to this rare sensitivity of networks to certain perturbations it is unclear how precisely biochemical_parameters must be experimentally_measured in order to accurately_predict network function results here we examined a model of cardiac adrenergic signaling and found that its robustness portrait a global measure of steady_state network function was well conserved even when all parameters were rounded to their nearest orders_of in contrast adrenergic network kinetics were more sensitive to parameter precision this analysis was then extended to additional networks including escherichia_coli chemotaxis stem_cell and cytokine_signaling of which nine exhibited conserved robustness portraits despite the order of magnitude approximation of their biochemical_parameters thus both fragile and robust aspects of diverse biological_networks are largely shaped by network_topology and can be predicted despite order of magnitude uncertainty in biochemical_parameters these findings_suggest an iterative strategy where order of magnitude models are used to prioritize experiments toward the fragile network elements that require precise measurements efficiently driving model revision robustness is a key emergent property of many biological_systems systems are considered robust if they are able to retain core functionality in the face of external e g temperature ligand_concentration and internal e g gene or protein expression perturbations robustness despite variations in biochemical_parameters has been observed in a number of computational and experimental_studies including bacterial chemotaxis segment polarity in insect development nfb oscillations and osmoregulation network robustness leads to the hypothesis that proper network function to whom correspondence should be addressed does not require fine_tuning of biochemical_parameters however many of these studies have also shown that the same network can be highly_sensitive to certain perturbations leading to the qualification that complex_networks are robust yet fragile a fundamental challenge presented by this alternate view is that without having measured all biochemical_parameters with high_precision a priori it is uncertain whether one could accurately_predict to which perturbations a network is fragile or robust in this study we asked what is the quantitative precision of biochemical_parameters required to accurately_predict the robust yet fragile nature of a biological_network starting with a wellvalidated model of cardiac adrenergic signaling we systematically characterized this networks steadystate functional_relationships or robustness portrait with both the original fine_tuned model and a model in with each parameter was rounded to its nearest order of magnitude the order ofmagnitude parameter approximation introduced here is analogous to techniques widely used in physics and engineering robustness portraits of the original and approximate models were well correlated even when parameters were approximated to their nearest two orders_of order of magnitude approximate models also outperformed randomized models of equivalent parameter variance we then applied the order of magnitude analysis to additional biological_networks and found that most networks were similarly insensitive to order of magnitude parameter_estimates this indicates that quantitative functional_relationships are largely shaped by network_topology the ability to predict the robust yet fragile nature of biological_networks despite order of magnitude parameter_uncertainty suggests a strategy where order of magnitude models are used to identify the experiments that reveal the most fragile information rich aspects of a biological_network efficiently guiding model refinement in this study we computationally explored conservation of global functional_relationships in biological signaling_networks in the face parameter imprecision starting with a biochemically detailed computational_model of cardiac adrenergic signaling order of magnitude analysis revealed that this network shows a steady_state robustness portrait that is insensitive to parameter precision within two orders_of however predictive_capability was lost when parameter approximations became very rough n oom or when parameters were randomly_assigned suggesting that this networks function depends on both network_topology and biochemical parameter precision within orders_of we then extended this analysis to additional signaling_networks finding that key_properties of these networks were also generally preserved when order of magnitude approximations were applied thus the steady_state robustness portrait of a signaling_network can be predicted even when parameter data are imprecise this systems insight suggests a rational approach for prioritizing experiments towardsthe most fragile elements of a network driving subsequent model revision and quantitative_understanding
