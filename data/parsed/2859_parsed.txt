memdock an a helical membrane protein_docking algorithm motivation a wide_range of fundamental biological_processes are mediated by membrane_proteins despite their large number and importance less than of all d protein_structures deposited in the protein_data are of membrane_proteins this is mainly due to the challenges of crystallizing such proteins or performing nmr_spectroscopy analyses all the more so there is only a small number of membrane proteinprotein_complexes with known structure therefore developing computational_tools for docking membrane_proteins is crucial numerous methods for docking globular_proteins exist however few have been developed especially for membrane_proteins and designed to address docking within the lipid_bilayer environment results we present a novel algorithm memdock for docking a helical membrane_proteins which takes into consideration the lipid_bilayer environment for docking as well as for refining and ranking the docking candidates we show that our algorithm improves both the docking accuracy and the candidates ranking compared to a standard proteinprotein_docking algorithm availability and implementationanalysis of the complete genomic_sequences for several organisms indicates that of all genes code for membrane_proteins due to their central role in a wide_range of fundamental biological_processes membrane_proteins constitute around of approved drug_targets however despite their large number and importance and even though there is an increasing number of solved membrane protein_structures they are still under represented in the protein_data pdb in july only pdb entries were of membrane_proteins http blanco biomol uci edu mpstruc this is owing to the difficulties_involved in expressing purifying and crystallizing these proteins in light of this deficit of empirical information it is particularly important to develop efficient computational_methods for predicting the structure interactions and docking of membrane_proteins docking algorithms aim to predict the atomic_resolution structure of a proteinprotein_complex given the structure of the separate proteins binding of two proteins to form a complex often results in conformational changes of the proteins therefore there is a distinction between docking of bound and unbound protein_structures the conformation of the bound structures is identical to their conformation in the complex whereas the unbound structure conformations are either the native_conformation of the separate proteins in solution or their conformation in other complexes docking unbound structures is a significantly more difficult_task since as mentioned above the unbound proteins might undergo conformational changes upon binding the pipeline of docking algorithms usually includes three steps i rigid docking ii conformational refinement and iii docking candidates re ranking by an energy score numerous methods exist for the first step of rigid protein_docking these include fast_fourier based_methods zdock shape_complementarity search by geometric hashing patchdock monte_carlo based_algorithms or information driven methods e g haddock in the first step of rigid_body docking minor steric clashes between the receptor and the ligand structures are penalized liberally thus tolerating conformational inaccuracies which usually do not affect the protein_backbone but could have a significant impact on the side chain conformations consequently the calculated energy value of a docking candidate could be high even if it is a near native one thus it is necessary in the next step of refinement to remove steric clashes from the structures by exploring the conformational_space of the side_chains while allowing minor movements in the backbone as well all refinement methods use energy based scoring_functions for re ranking the candidate complexes in the last step membrane_proteins have special_properties which are determined by their hydrophobic environment since the membrane imposes strong folding constraints the polar_groups of the polypeptide backbone of the membrane_protein participate in intra_molecular hydrogen_bonds this is typically accomplished through two structural_motifs the membrane_spanning alpha helix_bundle and the beta_barrel one of the advantages of membrane_protein modeling is the smaller conformational search_space which includes those two structural_motifs in the past_decade there was a vast improvement in membrane_protein modeling as outlined in a recent comprehensive_review developing algorithms for membrane_proteins docking is important for understanding various fundamental biological_processes and especially for drug_design performed a systematic study on the suitability of some commonly used protein_docking software_designed for globular_proteins for modeling complexes of membrane_proteins their results indicate that these algorithms can be used for obtaining relatively reliable models of membrane protein_complexes however the proteinprotein docking_results for membrane_proteins are worse than corresponding results for water soluble_proteins they also conclude that the gramm x algorithm may be considered the best performing algorithm for membrane_proteins kaczor et_al explain gramm x success by noting that it takes_into evolutionary_conservation in its scoring_function developed an algorithm for predicting the quaternary_structure of a helical multi homo oligomers based on the zdock docking suite in a post_processing step they filter the results which do not conform with the expected orientation of the transmembrane_segments vis_a the membrane lipid_bilayer also developed a protocol for modeling gpcr dimers in the protocol each monomer is rotated around its z axis by increments of p resulting in dimer models compatible with membrane integration in the next step rosetta proteinprotein_docking is applied using local refinement mode resulting in a final population of dimer models the obtained dimer models are evaluated according to a set of scoring factors especially tailored for gpcr the scoring_function contains up to different parameters such as potential energy electrostatic interaction_energy free_energy of binding energy of hydrogen_bond evolutionary_conservation score shape_complementarity and more the protocol was evaluated on six gpcr dimers the results showed a correct indication for all six dimers developed a tool mpdock which combines rosettamp with the rosettadock algorithm the algorithm conducts a local docking refinement of proteinprotein_complex hypotheses mpdock was tested on five proteinprotein_complexes out of models for each complex the scoring_function was able to rank the native like as a top scoring in about half of the targets recentlydeveloped an algorithm for docking membrane_proteins in their work they use the rigid_body docking algorithm dock pier without adaptation to the membrane_environment then the results are re ranked with a new score developed for membrane_proteins in which a new energy term is added representing the membrane transfer energy the algorithm was applied to a benchmark of protein_complexes and was able to obtain a near native_structure in the top ten solutions for of the complexes in the current paper we present an integrated docking algorithm which includes the docking refinement and re ranking stages designed for docking within the membrane our docking algorithm memdock attempts to customize all three docking steps to the lipid_bilayer environment the first step of our algorithm is based on the patchdock algorithm patchdock is an efficient rigid unbound soft docking algorithm which ranks docking candidates mainly by geometric shape_complementarity between the docked proteins in the modified patchdock mem patchdock the hypothesized placement of the docked proteins is enforced to be in a membrane consistent orientation thus the change in the angle formed between the protein helical axis and the membrane normal in the apo and holo forms of the protein is constrained likewise the shift in the position of the protein helices along the membrane normal cannot change significantly as a result of the docking in the second step a refinement algorithm is used based on the fiberdock algorithm which conducts flexible refinement of docking candidates the method models both side chain and backbone flexibility and performs rigid_body optimization of the ligand orientation in the modified fiberdock mem fiberdock perturbations of the ligand are enforced to be in a membrane consistent orientation similarly to the rigid docking step finally the refined models are re scored and re ranked according to an energy function that was designed specifically for membrane_proteins we evaluated our algorithm on an a helical membrane_proteins dataset and show that it performs well and much faster when docking membrane_proteins compared with the original algorithms designed for the docking of globular_proteins the memdock algorithm is particularly efficient mem patchdock running time on membrane_proteins is by an order of magnitude shorter than that of the original algorithm patchdock moreover the number of docking candidates drops significantly with memdock and the percentage of complexes with an at least acceptable docking candidate increases the results are presented inand inof the supplementary_materials we introduced an algorithm with excellent_performance for docking and refinement of a helical membrane_proteins this improvement is achieved by introducing sampling and scoring specific for membrane_proteins first we enforce membrane consistent orientation in both docking and refinement steps as an integral part of the algorithms rather than a post_processing step second the refined docking candidates undergo re ranking using a scoring_function formulated from combination of knowledge_based derived from statistical_analyses of known d structures of a helical membrane_proteins and the firedock scoring_function terms which are based on the binding forces between the receptor and the ligand the algorithm was applied to a benchmark set of bound proteins structures and unbound protein_structures in of the bound benchmark set and of the unbound benchmark set an acceptable docking candidate was ranked at the top in of the bound benchmark set and of the unbound benchmark set an acceptable docking candidate was predicted among the top ranking results thus the algorithm is shown to perform well both on the bound and on the unbound examples the algorithm significantly_improves docking accuracy and the speed compared to the standard docking a web_server for the memdock algorithm is being currently implemented and will be available at http bioinfo d cs tau ac il memdock
