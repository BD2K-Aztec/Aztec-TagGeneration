recognition models to predict dna binding_specificities of homeodomain proteins motivation recognition models for protein_dna which allow the prediction of specificity for a dna_binding based only on its sequence or the alteration of specificity through rational_design have long been a goal of computational_biology there has been some progress in constructing useful models especially for c h zinc_finger but it remains_a with ample room for improvement for most families of transcription_factors the best available methods utilize k nearest_neighbor knn algorithms to make specificity predictions based on the average of the specificities of the k most similar proteins with defined specificities homeodomain hd proteins are the second most abundant family_of after zinc_fingers in most metazoan genomes and as a consequence an effective recognition model for this family would facilitate predictive_models of many transcriptional_regulatory within these genomes results using extensive experimental_data we have tested several machine_learning and find that both support_vector and random_forests rfs can produce recognition models for hd proteins that are significant improvements over knn based_methods cross_validation analyses show that the resulting models are capable of predicting specificities with high_accuracy we have produced a web_based prediction_tool premotf predicted motifs for transcription_factors http stormo wustl edu premotf for predicting position frequency matrices from protein_sequence using a rf based model it is a long_standing goal to predict the dna binding_specificity of a transcription_factor tf based only on its protein_sequence that ability would allow for the inference of regulatory_networks from genome_sequences alone as well as for the design of tfs with desired recognition_sequences early hopes for a simple recognition code were dashed by the structures of the first few protein dna_complexes as the structures of more dna protein_complexes were determined it became apparent that there were definite preferences for interactions between particular amino_acids and base_pairs and that those preferences might vary depending on the class of tf c h zinc_finger in particular were heavily studied and a degenerate qualitative recognition code was shown to be moderately successful at predicting their binding_specificities choo to whom correspondence should be addressed and this general idea of classspecific degenerate recognition codes was further developed into a quantitative probabilistic code for zinc_finger that was more predictive than previous_models but sill less accurate than desired the homeodomain hd family is the second most abundant tf family in mammals and most metazoans the hd tf family was first discovered in drosophila where mutations in some hd proteins caused_severe homeotic phenotypes homeodomains typically span residues that fold into a stable bundle of three alpha_helices the c terminal helix or recognition helix binds in the major_groove and an unstructured n_terminal arm binds in the minor_groove this domain provides a favorable family for construction of a predictive recognition model because of similarities in docking geometry for a number of family_members and the characterization of specificity for many members of this family present in the yeast drosophila and mouse genomes using specificity data for hd proteins mostly determined using new high_throughput methods allowed us to test different machine_learning and to assess the ability of recognition models to accurately_predict the specificity of hd proteins using a crossvalidation methodology we demonstrate that both support_vector svms and random_forests rfs based_methods produce recognition models that are significantly better than previously_published lists the number of hd proteins from each of five species including variants of fly hd proteins the experimental method used to determine their specificity and the reference for the datasets all wild_type protein_sequences were obtained from uniprobe or flyfactorsurvey the hmmsearch program from the hmmer suite was used to extract the dbd for every protein using the homeobox pfam hmm_model pfam id pf protein binding microarray pbm data are available for mouse hd proteins but of these dbx hoxb hoxb hoxc irx lhx lhx lmx b obox pax phox a six titf tlx were removed from the dataset because their scaled beeml pbm pwms position_weight see below had a total information content ic std below the mean ic for the entire combined set of motifs the hd dbds were aligned using mafft which gave_higher quality alignments with fewer gaps than other programs perhaps the best studied hd protein is the drosophila engrailed protein for consistency with previous_studies hd positions are numbered with respect to the engrailed hd and all columns in the multiple_sequence that contained insertions relative to engrailed were removed only a small minority of the proteins in the dataset had short insertions relative to engrailed the majority of these insertions correspond to the three residue tale insertion between positions and two other types of insertions only occur in the mouse proteins hdx hmbox tcf and tcf displays a sequence_logo for the set of aligned hd proteins used in this study the goal of this study was to find improved recognition models for the hd family of tfs although they are a very abundant tf family in nearly all eukaryotic_organisms previous_models have focused on simple nearest_neighbor type predictions of specificity based on large archives of reference recognition motifs these previous_models have not been informed by the combination of feature_selection derived from mutual_information and modeling against reliably aligned recognition motifs which could limit their predictive_power we had previously_published a nearest_neighbor approach for predicting pwms for new hds but we found that an rf based model trained with the same fly b h sanger data had better performance on a mouse test_set also used a nearest_neighbor approach but they only attempted to predict mer enrichment_scores for novel hd proteins they compared various machine_learning but found nothing that was better than nearest_neighbors but their efforts may have been hampered by an inability to align the motifs they used for training and therefore having to rely on mer enrichments our results demonstrate that with ample high_quality and quantitative training data sophisticated machine_learning are capable of determining very good recognition models for hd proteins we believe that these models should be broadly_applicable to other families of tfs with the caveat that large deviations in domain docking within subgroups could complicate family analysis in support of this view we have preliminary data demonstrating that this type of approach can provide improved models for dna_recognition by zinc_finger even though they have been extensively_studied in the fold_cross analysis the average mse for this rf model was compares the observed and predicted motif logos for different hd dbds that are in the range of the average mse to illustrate the expected_accuracy of the predictions we have produced a webbased prediction_tool premotf predicted motifs for
