inference of historical migration_rates via haplotype_sharing pairs of individuals from a study cohort will often share long_range haplotypes identical by descent such haplotypes are transmitted from common_ancestors that lived tens to hundreds of generations in the past and they can now be efficiently detected in high_resolution genomic_datasets providing a novel source of information in several domains of genetic_analysis recently haplotype_sharing distributions were studied in the context of demographic inference and they were used to reconstruct recent demographic events in several populations we here extend the framework to handle demographic models that contain multiple demes interacting through migration we extensively test our formulation in several demographic scenarios compare our approach with methods based on ancestry deconvolution and use this method to analyze masai samples from the hapmap dataset availability doris a java implementation of the proposed method and its source_code are freely_available atrecent advances in high_throughput enable population wide surveys of genetic_variation although exacerbating challenges associated with data_handling this increase in volume and resolution had the effect of exposing new genomic_features creating the need for new models and computational_tools among these new genomic_features identical bydescent ibd haplotypes have recently_emerged as a new source of information in several genetic applications ranging from genotypephenotype association studies to the reconstruction of recent familial relationships the inference of recent demographic events or the study of natural_selection ibd segments are co inherited from recent common_ancestors by pairs of individuals and are delimited by historical recombination_events such recombination_events can now be detected in cohorts that have been densely genotyped although not requiring the availability of full sequences and several methods have now been developed for efficient ibd detection in large_datasets although shared haplotypes are found to be common even across populations that diverged hundreds of generations ago the average detectable ibd segment is transmitted from shared ancestors that lived tens to a few hundreds of generations before present haplotype_sharing analysis is therefore suitable to reveal the signature of the relatively recent demographic events that followed the agricultural revolution where most classical_methods provide limited insight leveraging this property of ibd several recent surveys relied on shared haplotypes to analyze population demographics in a recent work we studied several theoretical quantities of ibd haplotypes as a function of the demographic_history of a population we used the derived framework to infer the demographic_history of two populations with different characteristics i a population that underwent substantial recent isolation ashkenazi_jews and ii a cohort that deviates from a single population model with migration across small demes likely playing an important role in shaping recent genomic_diversity kenian masai the analytical_models we previously described are limited by the assumption that all the analyzed samples belong to a single population although such models can be used to provide insights in cases of extreme historical isolation fine_scale interactions across populations were frequent in recent history and the reconstruction of these events is of great interest for genetic driven investigation of historical events and genetic_analysis at large in this article we propose an extension of the analytical framework described in allowing to explicitly_model the presence of multiple_populations that interact through migration_rates we test our approach on several synthetic populations with known population_size changes and migration_rates finding that our model accurately matches the empirical distributions and provides a novel tool for the inference of recent demographic events that involve_multiple interacting demes we compare our method with existing_approaches based on the distribution of migrant tracts obtained through ancestry deconvolution and we revisit the analysis of the masai population using the presented formulation in this article we have extended our previous work on the relationship between long_range haplotypes that are shared ibd across individuals from a study cohort and the demographic_history of the individuals populations of origin specifically the described framework removes the limiting requirement that all sampled individuals belong to a single population and allows for explicitly modeling and inferring demographic interactions across multiple demes the evaluation we performed on synthetic populations confirms the accuracy of the derived ibd model and suggests that haplotype_sharing can be used to gain insight into fine_scale demographic dynamics for the past tens to few hundreds of generations provided enough samples are collected our analysis of the hapmap masai samples as well as our previously_reported analysis of an askenazi cohort suggests that this method can be applied to currently available datasets provided that the quality of haplotype_phasing and ibd detection is carefully considered among available methods for demographic inference another approach that explicitly_models the effects of recombination the pairwise sequentially markovian coalescent model psmc was recently_proposed in li and durbin this model relies on a markovian approximation of the coalescent with recombination and is able to simultaneously consider the effects of mutation and recombination the psmc however differs from the proposed ibd based model for its applicability as it requires full sequence_information and is currently focused on the analysis of remote demographic events using single individuals or pairs of phased chromosomes because of the scarcity of coalescent events in the recent history the simultaneous analysis of multiple samples is needed to infer recent demographics an extension of the psmc to handle the analysis of multiple samples however is computationally_challenging and efficient approximations are being developed in addition to these whole sequencebased methods independent current work infers historical demographic changes from length distributions of ibd segments taking a complementary less parametric approach thereby allowing increased flexibility during inference of plausible coalescent time distributions but without providing explicit modeling of migration and population_size changes among other methods aimed at inferring migration our approach is conceptually related to those that rely on the frequency and length of migrant tracts these methods however do not model population_size fluctuations and are dependent on the possibility of reliably performing ancestry deconvolution to assign chromosomal tracts to a set of reference_populations these populations may not be available and more importantly need to be substantially divergent to attain high_quality deconvolution as shown in our analysis although whole sequence_datasets and methodological_developments may improve the performance of deconvolution methods this limitation may prevent methods based on migrant tracts from being effectively used in the reconstruction of fine_scale migration_patterns of the recent millennia methods based on ancestry deconvolution however may in some scenarios be used in concert with methods based on ibd_sharing knowing whether an ibd tract was co inherited from a specific population in fact may provide information on the directionality of migration and also offer further insight into deeper time scales as shown in this direction may be further explored in light of the recently_developed analytical model for migrant tracts and the presented model for ibd the proposed ibd framework will further be enhanced by accurate whole_genome sequence_information as the presence of mutations on ibd segments will improve the timing of common_ancestors and ibd detection of shorter segments finally our model still relies on the assumption of selective neutrality natural_selection has been shown to have an impact on long_range haplotype_sharing although selective forces are mostly visible at local scales demography affects the entire_genome this framework could therefore be used to test local deviations from neutrality and the presented extension which handles the case of multiple population models may further assist the analysis of cross population ibd_sharing in this context
