condop an r package for condition_dependent operon predictions the use of high_throughput to predict dynamic operon structures in pro karyotic genomes has recently gained popularity in bioinformatics we provide the r implementation of a novel method that uses transcriptomic features extracted from rna_seq transcriptome profiles to develop ensemble classifiers for condition_dependent operon predictions the condop package provides a deeper insight into rna_seq and allows scientists to highlight the operon organization in the context of transcriptional_regulation with a few lines of code transcriptome_profiling of bacterial_organisms by high_throughput rna_seq can be used to predict operon structures we have recently_proposed a new computational strategy that integrates rna_seq transcriptome profiles with dna sequence_based information to accurately_predict operons in a condition transcriptome specific_manner our method is capable of highlighting significant changes occurring in the operon map annotated in the door database in specific dynamic conditions assayed at the transcriptome level by rna_seq to this end an ensemble classification system employing genomic and transcriptomic features is trained to distinguish operon pairs ops from non operon pairs nops the ensemble classifier is based on three different machinelearning approaches neural_networks nn support_vector svms and random_forests rfs the training of each model is based on a small set of ops and nops that are systematically selected from the rna_seq transcriptome profile and considered as gene_pairs with a known operon status the trained models are finally used to predict or re define the operon status of the gene_pairs that are excluded from the training and validation steps namely door operon pairs dops and those that are not annotated as operon pairs in the door database namely putative operon pairs pops the ensemble classification system is implemented with a simple majority_voting schema that combines the classification predictions of all the trained models after reclassifying the adjacent gene_pairs a linkage process is compiled to find adjacent genes predicted as ops and group them into operons this process generates a new operon map namely conditiondependent operon map here we present the r software_package condop an implementation of this method freely_available at cran https cran r project org sequence and intergenic_regions namely the cdss and igrs iii it calculates cutoffs to distinguish low expressed rna_seq from high expressed regions on the forward and reverse strand and iv it identifies the start and end_points in transcription the pre processed information is then used as input to the function run condop which develops an ensemble classifier combining both genomic and transcriptomic features to classify operon pairs each gene_pair is characterized by a set of features extracted from the genome_sequence the fasta file and the rna_seq transcriptome profile the condition_dependent operon predictions are defined with the following tasks i start and end_points in transcription associated with operons annotated in door are considered they are respectively named with osps and oeps ii confirmed operons are then determined and the datasets of ops and nops are built iii operon classification using genomic and transcriptomic features of confirmed ops and nops is performed iv the operon status of putative operon pairs pops is predicted and v the condition_dependent operon map is compiled and exported as a tab_delimited file here we show how to use condop to identify changes in the operon organization of escherichia_coli under two different growth conditions library condop data ct ga system file extdata nc gff

read_alignment and the generation of the count table data_files respectively the necessary inputs are included into the condop r package the pre proc function compiles the input data_structures for the main function run condop which is then used to build the condition_dependent operon map an important step of the run condop function is the selection of the confirmed operons upon which the set of ops and nops is built the users can influence this selection by properly modifying the thresholds bkgexprcds and bkgexprigr used for defining the detectable expression above the background supplementary_material s the set of ops and nops is used for the training and validation of three different classification_models which predictions are combined by using a simple voting schema the users can exploit the parameters cons to specify the minimum number of positive votes to declare a gene_pair as operon pair for instance with cons equals to the voting system tags a gene_pair as an op when at least two classifiers have predicted that gene_pair as an op all the models are trained and evaluated by using cross_validation and bootstrap users can indicate the number of folds and bootstrapping iterations by setting the nfolds and cl run parameters respectively further details about the parameter setting and the description of the data inputs output of the condop functions are provided as supplementary_materials supplementary_material s
