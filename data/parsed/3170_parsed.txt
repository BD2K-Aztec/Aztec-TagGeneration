structural_bioinformatics multistructural hot_spot characterization with ftprod computational solvent fragment mapping is typically performed on a single structure of a protein to identify and characterize binding_sites however the simultaneous analysis of several mutant structures or frames of a molecular_dynamics may provide more realistic detail about the behavior of the sites here we present a plug in for visual molecular_dynamics that streamlines the comparison of the binding configurations of several ftmap generated structures availability ftprod is a freely_available and open_source plug in that can be downloaded atthe identification and characterization of ligand_binding in proteins is of utmost_importance for research into drug_discovery and biomolecular function the experimental determination of regions on the surface of the protein with high recurrence of bound probes correlates well with the locations of drug binding_sites interested readers are referred to the following reviews and vajda and guarnieri one popular method for experimental determination of such druggable hot_spots involves the process of multiple solvent crystal_structures mscs during mscs the protein is solvated within various probe compounds the structure determined using x_ray indicates probe binding locations x_ray crystallization of multiple structures is expensive and computational fragment mapping can emulate this process to identify binding_sites various computational_methods for binding_site identification are compared in morrow and zhang the ftmap algorithm seeks to mimic the mscs method and has been shown to predict the analogous binding of probe molecules with a high degree of success to gain a comprehensive understanding about a proteins ligand binding_characteristics structural knowledge alone is often insufficient a single structure ignores protein dynamics which may alter probe binding location number and capacity here we present ftprod a program capable of clustering hot_spots spanning multiple structures and which allows for the ease of identification and characterization of those hot_spots with a graphical_user ftprod is a plug in for visual molecular_dynamics vmd a molecular_visualization program free for academic use we demonstrate ftprods ability to characterize and display cross structural ligand_binding by examining four x_ray crystal apo structures of na obtained from various influenza strains downloaded from the pdb the pdb ids of the strains we used were mwe hu hu and nss the primary role of na in influenza pathogenesis is the cleavage of sialic_acid after binding to the active_site another binding_site the secondary sialic_acid site is also partially responsible for substrate affinity depending on the strain na may possess a so_called pocket a highly_variable site which presents a target for drug_design efforts ftprod successfully identifies important binding_sites across the structures ranking them by decreasing predicted binding ability the sialic_acid binding_site is correctly_identified as the predominant binding location pdb structure hu docks more to whom correspondence should be addressed than twice as many probes as the sites in any other structure this is consistent with the structural understanding of hu which exhibits an open pocket one site identified for nss also corresponds to a location where an acetate ion has been resolved in the nss crystal_structure supplementary additional examples are provided in the supplementary_material the determination of potentially druggable sites on the surface of a protein represents an area of intense interest to drug_discovery and other applications ftprod provides the capability to compare the characteristics of pockets between crystal_structures of structurally_similar proteins the burden is placed on the user to determine_whether two structures ought to be compared rmsd based clustering of molecular_dynamics md trajectories could be one of many methods that may be used to identify input for ftprod along with binding_site similarity analogous structures similar substrates or any other structural similarity_metric ftprods utility is completely extensible toward the analysis of the frames of a simulation trajectory as may be generated by an md_simulation to our knowledge ftprod is the only existing tool that integrates protein structural_dynamics data for the purpose of binding_site characterization the inclusion of cross structural or dynamic information in the analysis of these hot_spots is likely to increase the predictive_accuracy and scope of these computational_methods by providing a more realistic picture of ligand_binding given the high success of the ftmap algorithm we expect that ftprod will greatly aid researchers in the analysis of protein pockets by streamlining interstructural cs comparison ftprod is presented as a plug in for the molecular viewer
