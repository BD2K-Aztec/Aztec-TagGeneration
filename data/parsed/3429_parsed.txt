systems_biology parmigene a parallel r package for mutual_information estimation and gene network_reconstruction motivation inferring large transcriptional_networks using mutual_information has been shown to be effective in several experimental_setup unfortunately this approach has two main drawbacks i several mutual_information estimators are prone to biases and ii available software still has large computational costs when processing thousand of genes results here we present parmigene parallel mutual_information estimation for gene network_reconstruction an r package that tries to fill the above gaps it implements a mutual_information estimator based on k nearest_neighbor distances that is minimally biased with respect to the other methods and uses a parallel_computing paradigm to reconstruct gene_regulatory we test parmigene on in silico and real_data we show that parmigene gives more precise results than existing softwares with strikingly less computational costs availability_and the parmigene package is available on the cran network at http cran r project org_web inferring_gene grns is currently one of the most challenging_task in systems_biology several approaches have been proposed to reconstruct grns using experimental_data paradigm of reverse engineering_approach such as bayesian_networks bn relevance networks rn and graphical gaussian models ggm seefor a comparative review while bn and ggm should be able to distinguish between direct and indirect edges rn does not however bn and ggm hardly work in the case of thousands of genes and with a small number of replicates while rn have the ability to deal with them the seminal paper ofextends rn introducing an algorithm based on the data_processing inequality dpi for removing indirect edges their approach called aracne has been successfully_applied to reconstruct the subnetwork of the myc gene in human b cells at the same time other methodologies have been proposed to remove indirect edges the clr and the mrnet algorithms for additional details see although successfully to whom correspondence should be addressed applied in the reconstruction of grns rn based on mi estimation are still affected by two major_drawbacks i some mi estimators are biased see_supplementary for details and ii even if rn computational_cost is comparatively lower than that of bn and ggm the time required to reconstruct the grn of several thousand genes is still extremely_large here we present parmigene parallel mutual_information calculation for gene network_reconstruction a novel fast and parallel r package that i performs network_inference implementing a minimally biased mi estimator following kraskovs algorithm hereafter knnmi based on k nearest_neighbor distances and ii uses openmp to implement a parallel grn reconstruction with a strikingly fast run times in the following we report i the bias obtained by knnmi compared with the other mi estimators ii the precision obtained by parmigene in the reconstruction of the myc subnetwork using real_data and iii the computational costs for grn reconstruction bias mi bias has been estimated for variables with low and with perfect non linear associations we compare knnmi from parmigene mi based on kernel density estimator implemented in kdemi and variable discretizations implemented in bioconductor_packages biodist and minet the shrinkage entropy estimator the miller madow and the schurmann grassberger estimators hereafter called shrink mm and sg for additional details see_supplementary shows the bias distributions while supplementary table s reports the average biases parmigene with knnmi shows the lowest bias lower ks seem to perform better in both scenarios in the following we will thus report only the results of parmigene with k precision the impact of the mi estimation on grn reconstruction has been verified using real_data on human b cells geo id gse the precision has been estimated using the subnetwork generated by the hub gene myc for which several true interactors are known proposed the aracne algorithm with the dpi implemented using a multiplicative tolerance minet implements only an additive tolerance that gives worse levels of precision parmigene implements both alternatives reports precision and rank score normalized average rank of true_positives values closer to represent the best results see_supplementary for details the aracne inference_method with the multiplicative tolerance gives the highest precision furthermore parmigene alwaysoutperforms the other estimators either for precision or for rank position computational time we tested the time required i to estimate mi and ii to infer grns with increasing number of genes shows the results in the case of large_scale experiments the entire gene_expression matrix parmigene computational time is strikingly better than those of exiting methods it is times_faster in the mi estimation and and times_faster respectively in the aracne and mrnet algorithms using parallel computationswith a quad core system parmigene is times_faster than other methods for mi estimation the mi estimator implemented in parmigene gives almost unbiased results and more importantly more precise results on real_data in addition parmigene has strikingly fast execution times
