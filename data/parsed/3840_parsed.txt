quantitative phosphoproteomics based molecular_network description for high_resolution kinase_substrate interactome analysis downloaded from motivation phosphorylation dependent cellular_signaling is known to play a diverse role in regulating multiple_cellular such as proliferation differentiation and apoptosis recent_technological in mass_spectrometry based phosphoproteomics have enabled us to measure network wide signaling dynamics in a comprehensive and quantitative_manner as conventional proteinprotein_interaction ppi_information based network_analysis is insufficient to systematically analyze phosphorylation_site dependent complex interaction dynamics here we develop and evaluate a platform to provide a high_resolution molecular_network description for kin asesubstrate interactome analysis results in this study we developed a cytoscape based bioinformatical platform named post_translational mapper ptmapper to integrate ppi data with publicly_available kinase_substrate relations at the resolution of phosphorylated amino_acid the previous phos phoproteome data on egf induced cellular_signaling in glioblastoma stem_cells was applied to evaluate our platform leading to discovery of phosphorylation dependent crucial signaling modulation in the p s k related pathway our study revealed that high_resolution cellular network description of phosphorylation_site dependent kinase_substrate signaling regulation should accelerate phosphoproteomics based exploration of novel drug_targets in the context of each disease related signaling availability_and ptmapper and the example data for construction of phosphoryl ation site oriented networks are available at https github com y narushima ptmapper protein_phosphorylation is one of the most well known post_translational ptms at serine threonine and tyrosine_residues within protein_sequences and plays_important various cellular_signaling correlated with cell_fate control due to the technical development of phosphoprotein peptide enrichment methodologies and the analytical improvement of lc_ms systems quantitative phosphoproteomics are now widely used to uncover global phosphorylation dynamics in cellular signaling_networks as with the analysis of genome and transcriptome_data advanced computational methodology is essential to translate phosphoproteome data into high_resolution protein_interaction towards better understanding of the detailed biological_mechanisms triggered by phosphorylation dependent signal_transduction quantitative phosphoproteomics based network_analyses could be mainly categorized into the two methods i visualization of activation dynamics by mapping the quantification data to each signaling_molecules and ii sub network extraction through the statistical calculation of network pathway enrichment based on the quantified phosphoproteome data the former is basically used for explanation of phosphorylation related fold changes in particular signaling_pathways the latter enables us to unbiasedly reveal functionally_important parts of signaling_networks which reflect quantitative changes observed in the phosphoproteome data leading to discovery of regulatory_interactions unannotated in the conventional signaling_pathways these network_analyses are mainly based on protein_protein ppi_information although the phosphorylationinduced reaction is controlled by site_specific kinases phosphatases in recent_studies the information on enzymesubstrate relationships between kinases and the corresponding phosphorylation_sites has rapidly accumulated in public phosphorylation_site databases such as phosphositeplus phospho elm and phosphonetworks the representative protein databases including uniprot kb human protein reference_database and nextprot also keep updating the large_scale information on phosphoyrlation sites and their specific kinases in spite of the drastic expansion of these public_databases there are few platforms to analyze quantitative phosphoproteome data using the kinasephosphorylation site datasets as noted above moreover phosphorylation_site oriented network_analysis is mainly applied for visualization of phosphoproteome data but not for statistical interpretation of network_dynamics therefore we developed a cytoscape based network_analysis platform named post_translational mapper ptmapper which enables us to describe phosphorylation_site dependent ppi dynamics and statistically analyze network_properties through combination with other cytoscape applications the ptmapper based analysis of our previous quantitative phosphoproteome data on egf_stimulated glioblastoma stem_cells led to discovery of phosphorylation dependent association regarding the p s k related pathway upon egf stimulation which was not unveiled in the network_structure based on the conventional ppi_information in this study we developed a bioinformatical platform named ptmapper to characterize the structures of phosphorylation_site oriented ppi_networks from the quantitative phosphoproteome data on egf_stimulated glioblastoma stem_cells our ptmapper based network_analysis unveiled p s k related signaling as one of the most significantly regulated sub networks which was not observed in the conventional ppi_network as some previous_studies demonstrated that p s k was correlated with survival and stemness maintenance of glioblastoma stem_cells the strategy based on phosphorylation_site oriented network_analysis proved to be effective to unbiasedly extract crucial signaling_pathways from the complex signaling_networks our ptmapper based computational_pipeline will be applied not only to phosphorylation but also to other ptms such as acetylation and ubiquitination and contribute to further understanding of highly diversified ptm dependent ppi_networks
