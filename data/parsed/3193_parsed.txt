genetics_and nam association studies in multiple_populations motivation mixed_linear provide important techniques for performing genome_wide however current models have pitfalls associated with their strong assumptions here we propose a new implementation designed to overcome some of these pitfalls using an empirical_bayes algorithm results here we introduce nam an r package that allows user to take into account prior information regarding population_stratification to relax the linkage phase assumption of current methods it allows markers to be treated as a random effect to increase the resolution and uses a sliding_window strategy to increase power and avoid double fitting markers into the model availability_and nam is an r package available in the cran repository it can be installed in r by typing install packages nam since the advent_of genotyping technology extensive efforts have focused on creating efficient mixed_linear mlm to address relatedness and computational issues in genomewide_association however major pitfalls that still must be improved including issues with resolution and detection_power furthermore mlm methods do not take into account the linkage phase associated with the multiple_populations that comprise the association panel association studies rely on persistent linkage_disequilibrium ld between markers and quantitative_trait qtl such associations decay over time through recombination_events triggering ld that allows differentiation between populations therefore association panels containing multiple_populations are more likely to display diverging linkage phases what makes qtl undetectable here we introduce nam a statistical package for association studies that aims to overcome some limitations of the mixed model framework and supports users to work with multiple_populations when a stratification factor is known
