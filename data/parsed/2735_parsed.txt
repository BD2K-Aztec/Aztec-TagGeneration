local statistics allow quantification of cell to cell variability from high_throughput microscope images motivation quantifying variability in protein expression is a major_goal of systems_biology and cell to cell variability in subcellular_localization pattern has not been systematically quantified results we define a local measure to quantify cell to cell variability in high_throughput microscope images and show that it allows comparable measures of variability for proteins with diverse subcellu lar localizations we systematically estimate cell to cell variability in the yeast gfp collection and identify examples of proteins that show cell to cell variability in their subcellular_localization conclusions automated_image methods can be used to quantify cell to cell variability in microscope images contact alan moses utoronto ca availability_and software and data are available atquantitative characterization of variability in gene_expression has been a major area of research in systems_biology pelkmans snijder and pelkmans time lapse movies of reporter_genes in live_cell fluorescence_microscopy demonstrated differences in protein expression between genetically identical cells cell to cell variability in protein_abundance was measured for most yeast proteins using highthroughput flow_cytometry of the gfp collection time lapse fluorescence_microscopy experiments have also revealed examples of proteins that show cell to cell variability in subcellular_localization for example the yeast stress_response transcription_factors msn and msn have been observed to continuously shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus to our knowledge cell to cell variability in subcellular_localization has not been systematically characterized here we set out to test whether cell to cell variability in protein_abundance and subcellular_localization could be systematically extracted from large image collections from automated microscopy still images have been used to quantify cell to cell variability in yeast protein_abundance and advances in automated genetics and microscopy have led to large collections of yeast images recently we and others have showed that quantitative_measurements of protein_localization and abundance can be extracted for single cells in these images however it is not obvious how to define a metric that allows meaningful comparison of variability between different proteins in particular proteins localized to different subcellular_compartments may show cell to cell variability simply due to imaging artefacts small organelles might be missed from cells or due to cell to cell variability in organelle size_and for example yeast mitochondria have highly_variable size_and proteins localized there will have more cellto cell variability than cytoplasmic proteins simply because of the underlying morphological variability another important_complication is due to differential protein regulation during the cell_cycle that creates cell to cell variability in asynchronously growing cells previous_studies of cell to cell variability in subcellular_localization have used protein specific measures for example a study of crz quantified bursts of nuclear_localization using the median intensity of the five brightest pixels in each cell while effective for that case that approach is unlikely to generalize to other proteins or be quantitatively comparable between proteins of differing subcellular_localizations as in efforts to analyze image_based measurements of morphological variability we define a local measure of variability which we call relative variability rv and show that it can be used to compare variability in both protein_abundance and spatial_pattern between proteins with different subcellular_localization classes we compare our image_based cell to cell variability estimates for protein_abundance cell to cell variability in total fluorescence_intensity with previous measurements from flow_cytometry and find reasonable agreement because our analysis is based on images we can also measure variability in the subcellular_localization pattern which we quantify using the spatial spread of the fluorescence in each cell which is not possible using conventional flow_cytometry we identify examples of proteins that show cell to cell variability in their spatial distribution within the cells to our knowledge this represents the first systematic measurement of cell to cell variability in subcellular_localization
