sequence_analysis orione a web_based framework for ngs_analysis in microbiology end_to next_generation microbiology data analysis requires a diversity of tools covering bacterial resequencing de_novo scaffolding bacterial rna_seq gene_annotation and metagenomics however the construction of computational_pipelines that use different software_packages is difficult owing to a lack of interoperability reproducibility and transparency to overcome_these we present orione a galaxy based framework consisting of publicly_available research software and specifically_designed pipelines to build complex reproducible workflows for next_generation microbiology data analysis enabling microbiology researchers to conduct their own custom analysis and data manipulation without software installation or programming orione provides new opportunities for data intensive computational_analyses in microbiology and metagenomics availability_and orione is available online at http application of next_generation ngs in microbiology is becoming a common practice with a profound impact on research diagnostic and clinical microbiology recent_applications include genomic_sequencing differential transcription analysis variant investigation as well as metagenomics studies major challenges include draft assemblies finishing followed by reliable genome_annotation or robust dissection of microbial_communities including those associated with human_health and disease furthermore there is an increasing need to process and present data in a fashion that is transparent and reproducible and to provide analysis frameworks that are usable and cost_effective for biomedical_researchers to address these challenges we developed orione an online framework for integrative_analysis of ngs microbiology data orione is based on galaxy an open platform for reproducible data intensive computational_analysis used in many diverse biomedical_research environment orione is the first freely_available platform that supports the whole life_cycle of microbiology research data from production and annotation to publication and sharing other commercial alternative exists e g clc genomics workbench by clc bio but orione is unique in transparently combining the most used open_source bioinformatics_tools for microbiology orione is currently applied to a variety of microbiological projects including bacteria resequencing de_novo assembling and microbiome investigations see http goo gl dwbgpd for a list furthermore orione is part of an ongoing project to integrate galaxy with hadoop based tools to provide scalable computing a specialized version of omero to model biomedical data and the chain of actions that connect them and irods to efficiently support inter institutional data_sharing this infrastructure is already used in production at center for advanced studies research and development in sardinia for the automated processing of sequencing_data and for quality_control in gene_therapy applications preprocessing quality_control and trimming the fundamental step before any ngs_analysis is the quality_control of reads and their trimming to cope with long_reads and pairedend technology fastx http goo gl gxqyv and fastqc http goo gl tuqd were complemented with specifically developed tools see also workflow in the supplementary_information reads mapping mapping is a key_step in many ngs applications from bacteria resequencing to variant_calling the most widely used aligners are integrated in orione including bwa bowtie bowtie soap and mosaik http git io qrywxg we further added blat shrimp lastz and bfast for use with long_reads from roche de_novo de_novo produces contigs without the aid of a reference_genome different methods either based on a de_bruijn velvet abyss and spades or on a greedy approach ssake edena are available in orione scaffolding after mapping contigs are ordered and oriented to produce even longer_sequences called scaffolds exploiting the mate_pair paired_end information orione includes the most established scaffolders such as ssake sspace sequel and sopra post assembly contigs statistics multi aligning and variant_calling this section of orione includes tools we have developed covering task such as genome_scale alignment high_quality contigs extraction statistics over contigs or draft_genomes n ng values contigs length_distribution high low quality regions gaps in draft_genomes annotation annotation is the process of identifying meaningful biological_information from sequences glimmer and trnascan se were wrapped into orione together with the prokka pipeline enabling easy genbank ddjb ena submission rna_seq we integrated edge pro tool for bacterial rnaseq analysis as edge pro requires genome_annotation files we developed an accessory tool get edge pro files that retrieves them directly from the ncbi refseq repository metagenomics and other tools we added to the standard galaxy metagenomics pipeline metaphlan and metavelvet the metagenemark annotation tool has been added for gene prediction in metagenomic_sequences and a workflow has been developed for bacterial metatranscriptome analysis we complete this section with instruments for data filtering conversion and taxonomy abundance displaying into the krona visualizer
