genetics_and finemap efficient variable_selection using summary data from genome_wide the goal of fine_mapping in genomic_regions associated with complex_diseases is to identify causal_variants that point to molecular_mechanisms behind the associations recent fine_mapping methods using summary data from genome_wide rely on exhaustive_search through all possible causal configurations which is computationally_expensive results we introduce finemap a software_package to efficiently explore a set of the most important causal configurations of the region via a shotgun stochastic_search algorithm we show that finemap produces accurate results in a fraction of processing time of existing_approaches and is therefore a promising tool for analyzing growing amounts of data produced in genome_wide and emerging sequencing_projects availability_and finemap v is freely_available for mac os x and linux atgenome wide association studies gwas have identified thousands of genomic_regions associated with complex_diseases any associated region may contain thousands of genetic_variants with complex correlation_structure therefore one of the next challenges is fine_mapping that aims to pinpoint individual variants and genes that have a direct effect on the trait this step is crucial for fully exploiting the potential of gwas to unveil molecular_biology of complex_traits and eventually provide targets for therapeutic_interventions for a recent review on fine_mapping see spain and a standard approach for refining association_signals is a stepwise conditional analysis an iterative procedure that conditions on the single_nucleotide snps with the lowest p value of association until no additional snp reaches the pre assigned p value threshold while conditional analysis is informative about the number of complementary sources of association_signals within the region it fails to provide probabilistic measures of causality for individual variants to overcome this problem many recent fine_mapping methods have adopted a bayesian_framework approaches for bayesian_analysis of multi snp gwas data include exhaustive_search as implemented in software bimbam mcmc algorithms variational approximations and stochastic_search as implemented in software guess and guessfm bayesian fine_mapping has also been conducted under a simplified assumption of a single causal v c the author published_by the main difference between finemap and caviarbf is the search_strategy to explore the space of causal configurations we compare the computational_efficiency and fine_mapping accuracy of finemap with caviarbf to assess the impact of replacing exhaustive with stochastic_search we also illustrate finemap on data from q snca region that contains a complex association pattern with parkinsons disease ukpdc and wtccc as well as on data from q lipc region associated with hdl c gwas have linked thousands of genomic_regions to complex_diseases in humans and in model_organisms fine_mapping causal_variants in these regions is a high_dimensional variable_selection problem complicated by strong correlations between the variables we introduced a software_package finemap that implements an important solution to the problem a stochastic_search algorithm to circumvent computationally_expensive exhaustive_search in all datasets we have tested finemap achieves similar accuracy as the exhaustive_search but uses only a fraction of processing time for example fine_mapping a genomic_region with snps allowing for at most five causal_variants completes in less than s using finemap while the exhaustive_search implemented in caviarbf is estimated to run over years computationally_efficient algorithms are a key to handle the ever increasing amount of genetic_variation captured by emerging sequencing studies as well as to scale up the analyses to whole chromosomes or even to whole genomes finemap uses a shotgun stochastic_search sss algorithm sss has been inspired by markov_chain mcmc algorithms that are widely used for bayesian_inference for a review on mcmc see standard mcmc methods such as the metropolis hastings algorithm and gibbs_sampler perform a sequence of steps in the parameter_space via a stochastic transition mechanism that ensures a valid approximation to the target distribution mcmc can often quickly reach an interesting region of the parameter_space but at each step it only considers one of the possible neighboring states this means that mcmc is often slow to explore a high_dimensional state_space to improve on this sss generates a whole set of neighboring configurations at each iteration and saves them all for further use in probability calculations this way a large number of parameter configurations with relatively high_probability is quickly explored this explains why an efficient stochastic_search can achieve accurate results in a tiny fraction of the processing time of an exhaustive_search our datasets were generated by requiring that the causal_snps had highly_correlated proxies absolute correlation greater than among the other variants the high_accuracy of finemap throughout these tests makes us believe that finemap is accurate in typical gwas data with complex correlation_structure among the snps although we have not encountered any dataset where finemap would not have performed well theoretically it remains possible that an in exhaustive_search could miss some relevant causal configurations a simple way to assess possible problems is to run many searches in parallel and compare and combine their outcomes another way is parallel tempering where several searches are run in parallel in different temperatures intuitively increasing_temperature flattens the likelihood_function and hence a search in a higher_temperature moves around more freely than one in a colder temperature such an approach together with complex global transition mechanisms to escape from local modes was introduced in an evolutionary stochastic_search algorithm by bottolo and richardson that was later tailored for genetic_analyses of multiple_snps and multivariate phenotypes in the software_package guess these two papers could give ideas how finemap could be further modified if trapping into local modes of the search_space were encountered in real_data of gwas regions summary data based fine_mapping methods require a highquality correlation estimate ideally the correlation_matrix is computed from the same genotype data from which the z scores originate in that case for quantitative_traits the equations in section connecting original genotype phenotype data and gwas summary data are exact and hence no information is lost by working with summary data for case control data a normal_approximation to the logistic likelihood causes some difference between the two approaches but the difference is expected to be small with current gwas sample_sizes for some populations sequencing of many thousands of individuals have either already been carried_out or will complete soon such reference data allow reliable fine_mapping down to low_frequency variants also when the original genotype data are not available a more challenging_problem is large meta_analyses that combine individuals from varying ancestries assuming that the causal_variants are included in the data and have the same effect_sizes across the ancestral backgrounds finemap can be run with the sample_size weighted snp correlation_matrix if these assumptions are not met then a hierarchical_model allowing separate snp correlation structures in each ancestry would perform better summary data based fine_mapping methods assume that the causal_variants are included in the data recent_advances in z_score imputation help to satisfy this requirement also when a causal_variant might not be genotyped however some snps are difficult to impute because they are not tagged well by the snps in the data we do not expect to capture well the association_signal from such snps either through imputation or indirectly through other snps in the data the output from finemap is a list of possible causal configurations together with their posterior_probabilities and bayes_factors similar to caviarbf these probabilities contain all the information from the model needed for downstream_analyses examples of useful derived quantities are the single snp inclusion probabilities single snp bayes_factors credible sets of causal_variants and a regional bayes_factor to assess the evidence against the null_model where none of the snps are causal we believe that finemap or related future applications of shotgun stochastic_search to gwas summary data enables unprecedented_opportunities to reveal valuable information that could otherwise remain_undetected due to computational limitations of the existing fine_mapping methods
