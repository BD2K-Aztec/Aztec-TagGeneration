gene_expression a beta mixture quantile normalization method for correcting probe design bias in illumina_infinium k dna_methylation data motivation the illumina_infinium k dna_methylation beadchip is a prime candidate technology for epigenome_wide ewas however a difficulty associated with these beadarrays is that probes come in two different designs characterized by widely different dna_methylation distributions and dynamic range which may bias downstream_analyses a key statistical issue is therefore how best to adjust for the two different probe designs results here we propose a novel model based intra array normal ization strategy for k data called bmiq beta mixture quantile dilation to adjust the beta values of type design probes into a statistical_distribution characteristic of type probes the strategy involves application of a three state beta mixture_model to assign probes to methylation states subsequent transformation of probabilities into quantiles and finally a methylation dependent dilation transformation to preserve the monotonicity and continuity of the data we validate our method on cell_line data fresh_frozen and paraffin_embedded tumour tissue_samples and demonstrate that bmiq compares favourably with two competing_methods specifically we show that bmiq improves the robustness of the normalization procedure reduces the technical variation and bias of type probe values and successfully eliminates the type enrichment bias caused by the lower dynamic range of type probes bmiq will be useful as a preprocessing_step for any study using the illumina_infinium k platform availability bmiq is freely_available fromin the past_few the field of epigenomics has risen to prominence epigenomics not only offers an improved understanding of fundamental biological_processes such as cellular_differentiation and early embryogenesis but is also widely_recognized to be key in understanding the pathogenesis of complex genetic_diseases like cancer one particular epigenetic mark of interest is dna_methylation indeed dna_methylation markers have been proposed as early detection diagnostic_and in a wide_range of different diseases underpinning this increased interest in epigenomics are significant advances in beadarray technology which now allow routine measurement of dna_methylation at over thousands of cpg_dinucleotides among these the illumina_infinium k human methylation beadchip offers both scalability and coverage probes and is thus suitable for epigenome_wide ewas a key statistical issue with the illumina k beadchip is that probes come in two different designs which causes the methylation_values derived from these two designs to exhibit widely different distributions indeed type probes are typically characterized by a much lower dynamic range compared with type probes even after adjustment for differences in biological_characteristics such as cpg density comparison with bisulphite pyrosequencing_data further showed that type probe values are biased and generally less reproducible to correct for this bias a peak based correction pbc method was proposed which normalises type design probes so as to render them comparable with type probes making the statistical distributions of type and type probes comparable is important for several reasons not doing so may introduce an enrichment bias towards type probes when ranking probes in supervised analyses as the dynamic range of type probes is significantly_higher moreover methods that seek to determine differentially_methylated also assume that probes within these regions are comparable and thus one would want to avoid any sources of technical variation within them finally one would wish to apply unsupervised dimensional reduction algorithms and classification algorithms to one single dataset and not separately to two different assays although the pbc method was validated in one dataset and has now been implemented in a pipeline for k data

the original_work applied to tissue_samples in fact as noted in these studies pbc breaks down when the methylation density_distribution does not exhibit well defined peaks modes hence both studies proposed subset quantile normalization_methods sqn and swan to correct for the type bias and which avoid the pitfalls of pbc in this work we show that pbc often leads to discontinuities holes in the type density_distribution to address this problem we here propose a novel mixture_model based normalization algorithm called beta mixture quantile dilation bmiq we subject bmiq to a rigorous evaluation using numerous independent datasets and using a number of different evaluation criteria to assess its robustness and performance specifically we assess bmiq in terms of reducing i the technical variance ii the type bias iii and the above_mentioned type enrichment bias we further benchmark bmiq against pbc and swan for assessing technical variance and to allow a comprehensive comparison of bmiq to pbc swan across many datasets we use in addition to replicates a novel evaluation framework based on using adjacent type type probe pairs within probe clusters a framework which we show leads to consistent and robust conclusions across independent datasets we demonstrate that overall bmiq compares favourably to pbc and swan in this work we have presented a novel mixture_model based algorithm bmiq for correcting the bias associated with type probe values in k studies confirming the observations in the density distributions which motivated our quest to find a more robust algorithm we have shown that bmiq improves the robustness and can successfully normalize the type distribution avoiding the appearance of such holes moreover bmiq successfully matches the tail ends of the type and type distributions while faithfully preserving the proportions of unmethylated and methylated probes within each of the two designs to further test bmiq we used data on technical_replicates to show that it reduces technical variability and matched bps data to show that it reduces the bias of type probe values using these criteria we have seen that bmiq leads to significant improvements similar to the improvements noted for pbc in relation to these evaluation criteria it is worth pointing out that bmiq was compared with pbc on samples with well defined type methylation peaks i e on data that were used to develop pbc itself hence it is likely that an evaluation of technical reproducibility using replicates and type value bias using matched bps data on data where the methylated type peaks are less well defined would favour bmiq over pbc however we did not have access to technical_replicates or matched bps data in the other specific datasets considered here therefore in order to further assess bmiq we devised a supervised framework across three independent datasets to objectively compare the algorithms in their ability to reduce the expected enrichment bias of type probes first we showed that if no design normalization is performed then there is indeed an enrichment bias towards type probes even when adjusted for cpg density we also showed that in two datasets pbc overcorrected the type data leading to an overinflated dynamic range thus favouring type probes and causing an overshooting of the enrichment_scores reflected by a significant underenrichment of type probes and c in contrast bmiq successfully avoided any type type enrichment bias in all three datasets indicative of an improved normalization of type values we should point out that the overcorrection of type values and the associated overinflated dynamic range caused by pbc is consistent with the presence of holes in the hemimethylated region of the type density_distribution thus with pbc there is an artificial expulsion of data_points from the hemimethylated region to the unmethylated and or methylated extremes in a further assessment of bmiq we conducted a detailed spatial analysis of dna_methylation at the level of probe clusters across independent datasets by carefully analysing adjacent type type probe pairs we observed that pbc can often overcorrect or suppress the data in some cases inducing abnormally large changes in methylation in contrast to bmiq which normalized type values in a way that rendered them more consistent with the values of neighbouring type probes interestingly bmiq also appeared to outperform swan which is part of the popular and widely used minfi package of note the reduction in technical variance achieved by bmiq was not at the expense of a lower biological signal
