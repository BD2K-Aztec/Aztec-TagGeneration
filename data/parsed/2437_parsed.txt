data_and inference of transcriptional_regulatory by bootstrapping patterns motivation transcriptional_regulatory which consist of linkages between transcription_factors tf and target_genes tgene control the expression of a genome and play_important in all aspects of an organisms life_cycle accurate prediction of transcriptional_regulatory is critical in providing useful information for biologists to determine what to do next currently there is a substantial amount of fragmented gene_regulation information described in the medical_literature however current related text analysis methods designed to identify proteinprotein_interactions are not entirely suitable for finding transcriptional_regulatory result in this article we propose an automatic regulatory_network inference_method that uses bootstrapping of description patterns to predict the relationship between a tf and its tgenes the proposed method differs from other regulatory_network generators in that it makes use of both positive_and patterns for different vector combinations in a sentence moreover the positive pattern learning_process can be fully_automatic furthermore patterns for active and passive voice sentences are learned separately the experiments use hif expert tagged articles from pubmed as the gold_standard the results show that the proposed method can automatically generate a predicted regulatory_network for a transcription_factor our system achieves an f measure of availability the software training test datasets and learned patterns are available attranscription factors tfs play_an in regulatory_systems a substantial amount of biological_research is continuously being conducted and the cumulative results obtained from the subsequent analyses are increasing rapidly many of these results are reported in the medical_literature however given this explosive_growth it is becoming more difficult for biologists to search read and assemble the information they need to whom correspondence should be addressed therefore many high_throughput techniques for extracting useful information from the literature have been proposed much research has been conducted on predicting proteinprotein_interactions ppis through text_mining these methods aim to extract more information than what is currently contained in curated databases such as bind kegg swissprot and the database of interacting_proteins however current related text analysis methods designed for finding ppi are not entirely suitable for finding transcriptional_regulatory because the presence of two proteins in a ppi sentence does not necessarily indicate these proteins have a tf and target_gene tgene relationship or that one controls the gene activity of the other the descriptive terms used for determining ppis may be different from those necessary to determine gene_regulation for example the words associate and interact which are descriptions that are useful for predicting ppis will cause a high_throughput automatic method to find substantial_amounts of false_positives in a regulatory_network moreover the regulatory descriptions could be different in articles written in passive versus active voice other existing_systems use manually defined patterns a popular writing style for describing gene interactions however these systems have low recall values furthermore existing_methods rarely discuss how negative terms will cause false_positives sanchez therefore this study takes_advantage of bootstrapping to automatically learn patterns for describing gene_regulation relationships and generating a transcriptional_regulatory this study introduced a pattern learning method using bootstrapping based on our experimental_results we found that users do not need to manually mark sentences for pattern learning in positive pattern training data consisting of tftgenestyle sentences resulted in better performance of the gene network finding method than data consisting of tgenetf style sentences the difference may be due to the writing habits of biomedical_researchers the literature tends to record research achievements page that is positive results and therefore authors are likely to describe their findings using active phrasing we also found that including only three to five abstracts for the initial training_datasets generated acceptable results this may be because many articles are published about the same tf and its specifically regulated_genes therefore it is easy to collect such literature entries into an initial dataset when a tuple is used for bootstrapping training it is easy to find many sentences from which to learn new patterns based on the retrieval effects from the seven vector styles in experiment the recall value of the middle vector is the highest at for tftgene style sentences and for tgenetf style sentences the values of precision are for tftgene style sentences and for tgenetf style sentences this result shows that patterns generated by the middle vector are the most representative this may be because the keywords related to certain tf regulates this particular gene almost always appears in the middle vector for phrases such as activation of induction of transactivation of activate and other similar phrases experiment indicated that the three methods for generating initial datasets do not result in obviously different performances of the gene network finding method performance using manually marked sentences is not always better than using automatically or semi automatically marked sentences in addition the trained patterns were similar whether we manually marked results or used page
