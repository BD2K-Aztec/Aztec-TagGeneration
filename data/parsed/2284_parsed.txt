genome_analysis identification of chromosomal_translocation hotspots via scan statistics motivation the detection of genomic_regions unusually rich in a given pattern is an important undertaking in the analysis of next_generation data recent_studies of chromosomal_translocations in activated b lymphocytes have identified regions that are frequently translocated to c_myc oncogene a quantitative method for the identification of translocation hotspots was crucial to this study here we improve this analysis by using a simple probabilistic_model and the framework provided by scan statistics to define the number and location of translocation breakpoint hotspots a key feature of our method is that it provides a global chromosome wide nominal control level to clustering as opposed to previous methods based on local criteria while being motivated by a specific application the detection of unusual clusters is a widespread problem in bioinformatics we expect our method to be useful in the analysis of data from other experimental_approaches such as of chip_seq and c seq results the analysis of translocations from b lymphocytes with the method described here reveals the presence of longer hotspots when compared with those defined previously further we show that the hotspot size changes substantially in the absence of dna_repair bp when bp deficiency is combined with overexpression of activation_induced the hotspot length increases even further these changes are not detected by previous methods that use local significance criteria for clustering our method is also able to identify several exclusive translocation hotspots located in genes of known tumor supressors availability_and the detection of translocation hot_spots is done with hot scan a program implemented in r and perl source_code are freely_available for download at https github com itojal hot scan the identification of genomic_regions that are unusually rich in a given pattern is a recurring problem in bioinformatics widespread in the analysis of data generated by deep_sequencing an example of this is the detection of regions with an unlikely high clustering of chromosomal_translocation breakpoints recurrent chromosomal_translocations are associated with hematopoietic_malignancies such as leukemia and lymphoma and with some sarcomas and carcinomas there is growing evidence that translocations are not random among basic determinants of these events are the existence of chromosome_territories active_transcription and most prominently targeted dna_damage dna_double dsbs are necessary intermediates in chromosome_rearrangements and they occur in the cell during normal metabolic_processes and can be induced by genotoxic_agents or during physiological dna_recombination in lymphocytes the majority of human lymphomas are of mature b cell origin and many of them carry balanced chromosomal_translocations that involve immunoglobulin_genes this susceptibility is most likely dependent on activation_induced aid the b lymphocytespecific enzyme that initiates class_switch csr and somatic_hypermutation shm two processes necessary for antibody diversification aid initiates shm and csr by deaminating cytosines in immunoglobulin_genes during stalled transcription several dna_repair process the resulting u g mismatch to introduce mutations or produce targeted dsb di besides being targeted to immunoglobulin_genes aid targets a large number of nonimmunoglobulin genes aid induced dsbs are recognized by dna_damage proteins and repaired by nonhomologous_end a process that can fail and result in chromosomal_translocations libraries of aid dependent translocations from primary b to whom correspondence should be addressed cells revealed many discrete sites throughout the genome that are targeted by aid some of these targets are known translocation partners identified in mature b cell lymphomas mutations in the components of dna_repair that process aid induced breaks can lead to defective csr and the most severe_defect is documented in bp deficient b cells bp is a dna_repair that regulates dsb processing and is required for genomic_stability it does so by facilitating distal dsb joining and by protecting dna ends from resection the landscape of aidinduced translocations in bp deficient b cells is different from the one found in wild_type cells deep_sequencing of translocation capture libraries from primary bp deficient b lymphocytes has shown that the profile of translocation hotspots changes most likely owing to increased dna end resection a quantitative method to determine the clustering of translocations was essential for the analysis of chromosomal_rearrangements in translocation hotspots were determined by using a technique similar to that used to define the coordinates of enriched protein binding regions in chip_seq a translocation cluster is defined by concatenating closely_spaced adjacent breakpoints and its significance is then determined by using a test based on the negative_binomial this method assumes that the observed breakpoints are realization of a bernoulli process by taking_advantage of this model here we consider a different approach for the detection of hotspots based on the use of scan statistics the scan statistic is well suited for this task because it provides a genome_wide level to breakpoint clustering using our method we are able to show that translocation hotspots induced by aid in activated b lymphocytes are longer than those previously_identified by the local method furthermore our method shows that long hotspots are more frequent in the absence of bp the frequency of the long hotspots is further increased if aid is overexpressed in bp deficient b cells we also discover a set of hotspots exclusively found by the scan statistic and discuss the potential biological_relevance of our findings here we describe a method for the identification of chromosomal_translocation hotspots in contrast to a previous procedure which we refer here to as the local method the control level for the detection of a cluster is defined on a chomosome wide basis by using scan statistics we show via simulations that scan statistics perform equally well as the local method in datasets where the hotspots are relatively obvious scan statistics are superior than the local method in more challenging situations characterized by a higher translocation rate outside hotspot regions this depends on the width of the scanning window and its choice requires some calibration we present a method that is able to accomplish this we show that inferences made with scan statistics have important consequences in the analysis of translocation hotspots in primary b cells the previous study byshowed that bp deficiency results in an increase of rearrangements to intergenic_regions and changes the frequency and distribution of translocations in immunoglobulin switch regions and other prominent hotspots our analysis adds to these findings by showing that the bp deficiency results in the overall enrichment of longer hotspots these results support the previous conclusion that bp prevents the resection of dna thus resulting in shorter hotspots our analysis here also shows that an increased amount of aid results in a substantial enlargement of pre_existing hotspot regions these changes can only be observed with wider scanning windows i e with w and and are not detected by previous methods because of their local characterization of clustering the success of the scan statistic here is brought by its ability to detect events spread across several scales as is shown by the analyses made with several scanning window widths our analysis with the scan statistic is able to identify several exclusive hotspots whose authenticity is supported by independent
