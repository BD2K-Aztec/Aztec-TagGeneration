genetics_and r phewas data analysis and plotting tools for phenome_wide studies in the r environment phenome_wide studies phewas have been used to replicate known genetic_associations and discover new phenotype associations for genetic_variants this phewas implementation allows users to translate icd_codes to phewas case and control_groups perform analyses using these and or other phenotypes with covariate adjustments and plot the results we demonstrate the methods by replicating a phewas on rs near hla_drb associated with multiple_sclerosis and performing a novel phewas using an individuals maximum white_blood wbc as a continuous measure our results for rs replicate known associations with more significant results than the original study on the same dataset our phewas of wbc found expected results including associations with infections myeloproliferative_diseases and associated conditions such as anemia these results demonstrate the performance of the improved classification_scheme and the flexibility of phewas encapsulated in this package genome_wide gwas have been an important research method for the past_years these studies typically take the form of a case_control where many genotypes are analyzed with a specific phenotype many software_packages such as plink and snptest have been developed to support gwas more recently phenome_wide studies phewas have been used to interrogate with which phenotypes a given genetic_variant may be associated phewas was originally described within an electronic_medical emr cohort and emr based phewas have been recently shown to replicate of sufficiently powered known associations across many disease domains as well as discover new associations phewas methods have been applied to research cohorts as well successfully replicating many known associations and finding potential novel associations visualization software has also been developed to help present and investigate phewas results focused on evaluating many phenotypes for a given set of genotypes phewas methods do not translate well to traditional gwas software which typically follows a one phenotype many genotypes paradigm although it is possible to perform analyses using existing software_packages it requires scripting many runs of the software to foster adoption of phewas we developed an r implementation of the most common functionality needed to perform and visualize emr based phewas this r package follows the methods detailed in but has been designed to use either genetic or non genetic data as the independent variable
