mocat a metagenomic assembly annotation and profiling framework mocat is a software pipeline for metagenomic sequence_assembly and gene prediction with novel features for taxonomic and functional abundance profiling the automated generation and efficient annotation of non redundant reference catalogs by propagating pre_computed assignments from databases covering various functional_categories allows for fast and comprehensive functional characterization of metagenomes availability_and mocat is implemented in perl and python designed for bit unix systems and offers support for high performance computer usage via lsf pbs or sge queuing systems source_code is freely_available under the gpl license atmetagenomics has enabled large_scale studies_investigating the structure function and diversity of microbial_communities the computational_analysis of samples often totaling many gigabases of sequence_data usually involves mapping reads to taxonomic and functional reference_databases which may require the de_novo of predicted genes and subsequent abundance profiling whereas taxonomic_profiling methodology has matured recently functional profiling still remains_challenging due to the difficulties in assigning functions to millions of reads from metagenomes moreover current metagenomic pipelines for functional_annotation and or profiling mainly implement metabolic_pathway or protein domain databases such as kegg seed or pfam here we present metagenomic_analysis toolkit version mocat which was developed to enable functional profiling of metagenomes based on a much wider_range and diversity of functional gene_annotations its features are compared to existing_tools in supplementary table s
