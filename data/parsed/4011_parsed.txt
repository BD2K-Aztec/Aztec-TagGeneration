rigid substructure search motivation identifying the location of binding_sites on proteins is of fundamental_importance for a wide_range including molecular_docking de_novo drug_design structure identification and comparison of functional sites here we present erebus a web_server that searches the entire protein_data for a given substructure defined by a set of atoms of interest such as the binding scaffolds for small_molecules the identified substructure contains atoms having the same names belonging to same amino_acids and separated by the same distances within a given tolerance as the atoms of the query structure the accuracy of a match is measured by the root_mean or by the normal_weight with a given variance tests show that our approach can reliably locate rigid binding scaffolds of drugs and metal_ions availability_and we provide this service through a web_server at http erebus the protein crystal_structures database contains a number of proteins whose functional role is not fully understood identifying potential_binding of small_molecules or metal_ions will allow optimizing docking protocols and may also help to elucidate the unknown protein functions here we introduce a server for identifying similar d protein substructures via direct comparison with a query structure analogous studies have targeted the identification of protein_folding motifs protein similarity detection search of protein_docking and ligand_binding and search of protein surface motifs here we focus on the search of a unique substructure of a larger protein with a known crystal_structure the problem of substructure search is a special_case of the subgraph isomorphism si problem the si problem is well studied and optimized algorithms have been proposed to solve it however here we incorporate tolerance to deviations from the query substructure possibly at the cost of speed or specificity we permit small differences between the pairwise_distances of atoms in the query and the target structures or allow some query atoms to be absent in the identified substructure in order to achieve this aim we capitalizeour implementation of the substructure search avoids the use of any si algorithms as the incorporation of tolerance to variations in atom identities and interatomic distances is not readily compatible with these algorithms instead we employ an iterated sorting and filtering scheme which first scans the target structure and collects those atom pairs that have an equivalent pair of atoms with matching distance as in the query structure these collected candidate pairs are then used to construct candidate substructures followed by the selection of the best matching substructures based on their weights substructure weight is defined as the geometric mean of weights w i of all n atom pairs in the substructure multiplied by an additional penalty w j where w j is the weight of a missing atom to account for up to m of such atoms the tolerance to deviations in atom pair distances is an important requirement as the available crystal_structures have limited_resolution and the conformation of a binding_pocket undergoes constant thermal_fluctuation available computational power imposes a practical limit on the tolerance that can be handled by our algorithm a higher tolerance results in a larger number of matches and therefore an increased structure processing time weshow that we can accurately locate the binding_pockets for small_molecules drugs poisons and adp scaffolds for metal_ions and in certain cases the binding_sites of short_peptides to illustrate these results we have prepared a test query structure using the following seven atoms of the tetracycline binding_pocket from tetracycline repressor pdb id bj h ne n nd n od f ce f ce h ne and q ne we perform a search for this substructure with a tolerance of on the entire pdb current as of october which at this time contains a total of tetracycline repressor structures and protein_structures models overall our method locates of these structures and it is interesting to note that not all of these structures have tetracycline bound the two tetracycline repressor structures ns and ns that we did not identify have active_site conformations very different from other tetracycline repressors most likely caused by mutations introduced in residues near the binding_site finally we point out that our method is not limited to the detection of surface features and can also detect buried substructures by providing information on proteins containing specified atoms and residues in the given spatial_arrangement erebus may serve as the first step in many structure analysis protocols
