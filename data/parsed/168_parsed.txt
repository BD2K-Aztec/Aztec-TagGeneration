structural_bioinformatics a graphical_interface for the foldx forcefield a graphical_user for the foldx protein design program has been developed as a plugin for the yasara molecular_graphics suite the most prominent foldx commands such as free_energy difference upon mutagenesis and interaction_energy calculations can now be run entirely via a windowed menu system and the results are immediately shown on screen availability_and the plugin is written in python and is freely_available for download at http foldxyasara switchlab org and supported on linux macosx and ms windows the empirical forcefield foldx was developed for the rapid evaluation of the effect of mutations on the stability folding and dynamics of proteins and nucleic_acids foldx is normally run from the command_line with userprovided configuration files to increase the usability many core functionalities of foldx have now become available through a complete graphics interface as a plugin for the yasara molecular viewer
