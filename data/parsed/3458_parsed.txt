genome_analysis pathway based visualization of cross_platform microarray_datasets motivation traditionally microarrays were almost exclusively used for the genome_wide analysis of differential_gene but nowadays their scope of application has been extended to various gen_omic features such as micrornas mirnas proteins and dna_methylation dnam most available methods for the visualization of these datasets are focused on individual platforms and are not capable of integratively visualizing multiple microarray_datasets from cross_platform studies above all there is a demand for methods that can visualize genomic_features that are not directly linked to protein_coding such as regulatory_rnas e g mirnas and epigenetic_alterations e g dnam in a pathway centred manner results we present a novel pathway based visualization method that is especially suitable for the visualization of high_throughput datasets from multiple different microarray_platforms that were used for the analysis of diverse genomic_features in the same set of biological_samples the proposed methodology includes concepts for linking dnam and mirna_expression datasets to canonical signalling and metabolic_pathways we further point out strategies for displaying data from multiple proteins and protein_modifications corresponding to the same gene ultimately we show how data from four distinct platform types messenger_rna mirna protein and dnam arrays can be integratively visualized in the context of canonical pathways availability the described method is implemented as part of the incromap application that is freely_available at www cogsys cs uni tuebingen de software incromap the first generation of microarray_platforms was developed as a high_throughput technique for profiling the transcriptome of diverse biological_systems i e cells organs or organisms under various experimental_conditions to date a plethora of different microarray_platforms are readily available these include gene centred platforms that rely on current genome_annotations and unbiased tiling arrays that interrogate large non repetitive_regions of the genome diverse types of platforms have been specifically_designed for the interrogation of different genomic_features ranging from messenger_rna mrna or microrna mirna transcripts through proteins or protein_modifications to relevant functional_elements such as exons single_nucleotide or promoters in addition to arrays serving for the quantification of global gene_expression on the rna or protein level also epigenetic_modifications such as dna_methylation dnam can be monitored on a genome_wide level using microarray_technology microarray_datasets are typically not only inspected on the level of individual genes but rather differential_gene in the context of groups of functionally_related for instance the overrepresentation of genes related to the same biological_process or involved in the same pathway is investigated by using statistical_tests e g fisher test or hypergeometric_test or gene_set traditional overrepresentation analysis methods require fixed sets of up or downregulated genes that are usually defined with fold_change and or p value cut_offs modern gene_set like methods in contrast do not require cut_offs to detect sets of functionally_related showing a trend towards differential_gene as a result of pathway enrichment a list of significant pathways that contain genes with strong differential_expression is returned to obtain more details about this result e g which genes are up or downregulated within a pathway suitable visualization methods are required several tools exist for the visual_inspection of datasets from individual platforms see for some examples as the first microarrays were mostly limited to mrna_transcripts the majority of these visualization_tools are still focused on mrna datasets however the current inventory of publicly_available tools which are capable of integrating and jointly visualizing data from multiple microarray_platforms is still limited although for genomic_features which are not directly linked to genes such as dnam or single_nucleotide data region based visualization methods e g the ucsc_genome are commonly used data from gene centred genomic_features mrnas proteins are often visualized using network based visualization methods e g cytoscape or kegg atlas although the former approach may provide more detailed information about individual genes or genomic_loci conclusions about higher_order mechanisms can often be more easily drawn from a pathway based view of the data thus we propose to first focus on pathways relevant to the studied phenomenon which can be identified using enrichment_analysis methods subsequently network hubs or key_regulators can be inspected in more detail using complementary region based visualization methods here we introduce a method for integrated pathway centred visualization of datasets generated from the same biological_samples using different microarray_platforms which monitor complementary genomic and epigenomic features in recent_years diverse tools were developed which are specialized in pathway analysis e g ingenuity or pathway visualization some of these tools offer visualizing experimental_data in a pathway e g kegarray pathline genmapp or mgv for this purpose the experimental_data are typically mapped to a colour gradient and displayed in the background colour of the pathway nodes genmapp or mgv even have capabilities to display multiple colours in a single_node e g for the visualization of time series experiments mgv goes one step further and offers additional features to put profile plots or heatmaps inside nodes however all of these tools are not able to handle data from genomic_features that have no direct reference to the genes in a pathway e g mirnas or genomic_regions furthermore none of these tools offers viable solutions that are tailored for the integration of multiple datasets obtained from heterogeneous microarray_platforms
