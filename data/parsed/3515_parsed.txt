data_and pgdspider an automated data conversion tool for connecting population_genetics and genomics programs the analysis of genetic data often requires a combination of several approaches using different and sometimes incompatible programs in order to facilitate data_exchange and file conversions between population_genetics programs we introduce pgdspider a java program that can read different file_formats and export data into partially_overlapping other file_formats the pgdspider package includes both an intuitive graphical_user and a command_line version allowing its integration in complex data analysis_pipelines availability pgdspider is freely_available under the bsd clause license onin the last few years high_throughput made it possible to sequence a huge amount of dna at a rapidly decreasing cost allowing for budget tight studies to produce large sequencing and population_genetics datasets a proper analysis of these data requires a combination of several approaches beginning with those describing basic_properties of the data followed by more specialized and often computer intensive analyses most of the times it requires the use of several population_genetic programs and different input_formats which necessitate numerous file conversions however data format conversion can be tedious and error_prone if not fully automatized especially when dealing with large_amounts of data to our knowledge only three programs are available to transfer populations genetics data between programs convert formatomatic and create whereas these programs can sometimes bridge many population_genetics program create reads input_formats and outputs formats convert reads and outputs whereas formatomatics reads and outputs these programs have some limitations for instance create and convert only handle codominant diploid genotypic data to whom correspondence should be addressed create focuses mainly on parentage analysis programs and formatomatics only deals with microsatellite data to improve data_exchange between programs for a vast range of data types we introduce here pgdspider an automated data conversion tool for population_genetics and population_genomics
