gene_expression pepper cytoscape app for protein complex expansion using protein_protein we introduce pepper protein complex expansion using protein_protein a cytoscape app designed to identify protein_complexes as densely_connected subnetworks from seed lists of proteins derived from proteomic_studies pepper identifies connected sub graph by using multi_objective involving two functions i the coverage a solution must contain as many proteins from the seed as possible ii the density the proteins of a solution must be as connected as possible using only interactions from a proteome_wide interaction_network comparisons based on gold_standard yeast and human datasets showed peppers integrative approach as superior to standard protein complex discovery methods the visualization and interpretation of the results are facilitated by an automated post_processing pipeline based on topological_analysis and data_integration about the predicted complex proteins pepper is a user_friendly that can be used to analyse any list of proteins most cellular_processes require a large number of proteins to assemble into functional complexes to perform their activity therefore describing functional protein_complexes taking part in given processes is critical to the underlying_molecular understanding experimental_protocols such as affinity_purification followed by mass_spectrometry ap ms have been devised to pull_down a protein of interest bait together with all the interacting_proteins within the same protein complex preys however these sets of preys may contain both false_positives proteins detected despite not actually interacting with the bait and omit false_negatives proteins interacting in the cellular_context studied but not detected effective control experiments and usage of contaminants repositories can remove some false_positives however false_negative interacting_partners identification thereby the definition of the entire protein complex remains_challenging protein_protein ppi data represents abundant information that can be used for this purpose protein_complexes extraction from ppi_networks is a very active area of research and many methodologies have been developed to tackle this problem these computational_methods generally model protein_complexes as dense subnetworks within the complete set of ppis and thus try to solve a graph_clustering problem or to identify dense regions clustering_approaches were shown to be efficient either on large ppi_networks or with largescale experimental_settings in which big numbers of baits result in context specific ppi_networks however these algorithms were not developed for use in small_scale ap ms experiments e g using only a single bait protein and are unable to integrate experimental_data with repositories of ppi we reasoned that although not all the protein_partners may be detected in a given ap ms experiment these proteins may have been previously_identified as interacting with either the bait or some of the preys of the experiment based on this hypothesis we developed pepper which addresses the problem of finding protein_complexes by combining the experimental_results of a single ap ms assay with the available information from protein interactions in a global ppi_network pepper solves this non trivial problem by using a multi objective evolutionary algorithm which was tested to demonstrate the relevance of our integrative approach to do so we used publicly_available ap ms datasets for yeast and human species and compared peppers results with those of state of the art protein complex discovery methods our findings highlight the relevance of integrating ppi repositories to the analysis of ap ms experiments we propose pepper as a cytoscape application to further refine protein complex predictions through functional and topological analyses
