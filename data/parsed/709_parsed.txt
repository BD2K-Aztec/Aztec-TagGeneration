sequence_analysis benchmarking the performance of human antibody gene alignment utilities using a sequence_dataset motivation immunoglobulin_heavy genes are formed by recombination of genes randomly_selected from sets of ighv ighd and ighj genes utilities have been developed to identify genes that contribute to observed vdj rearrangements but in the absence of datasets of known rearrangements the evaluation of these utilities is problematic we have analyzed thousands of vdj rearrangements from an individual s whose ighv ighd and ighj genotype can be inferred from the dataset knowledge of this genotype means that the stanford s dataset can serve to benchmark the performance of igh alignment utilities results we evaluated the performance of seven utilities failure to partition a sequence into genes present in the s genome was considered an error and error_rates for different utilities ranged from to availability supplementary data includes the s genotypes and alignments the stanford s dataset and an evaluation_tool is available ateffective responses to the antigenic diversity of the microbial world require the human immune system to produce antibodies with specificities of similar diversity the genetic_diversity necessary to encode such an antibody repertoire is generated by recombination for immunoglobulin_genes are created by the joining of a number of genes as each b cell develops within the bone_marrow the rearranged immunoglobulin_heavy igh variable_region are created by essentially random recombination of single ighv v ighd d and ighj j genes each selected from sets of germline genes during the recombination_process the recombining gene ends can be trimmed and variable numbers of non template encoded nucleotides may be inserted between the recombining genes additional diversity is generated during an immune_response by the process of somatic_hypermutation shm which can lead a rearranged vdj gene of around nts to accumulate in excess of point_mutations to whom correspondence should be addressed the processes of vdj recombination and shm when combined with the high similarity of many of the genes lead to difficulty in identifying the germline contributions to igh rearrangements this is particularly true of the d genes which range in length from just nt a number of utilities have been developed to identify the germline origins of vdj rearrangements we have previously used sets of clonally_related sequences to evaluate such utilities this provided a useful test but as rearrangements with differing characteristics long d short d highly mutated etc present different challenges for the utilities larger and more varied datasets are required for proper evaluation here we present an evaluation of igh alignment utilities based on alignment of large sequencing_datasets from single individuals the method is explored using the stanford s dataset the many thousands of vdj rearrangements in this dataset allow the individual genotype at the igh variable gene_loci to be inferred by assessing the number of alignments made to genes that are absent from the individual genotype using our evaluation_tool such datasets of rearrangements can be used for evaluation and improvement of igh alignment utilities no vdj rearrangement can be partitioned with absolute certainty but any alignment made to genes that are absent from the genome of the individual under study must be in error this study did not attempt to identify all incorrect alignments but rather it detected errors by reference to an individuals inferred genotype providing a measure of the minimum frequency of misalignments for each utility the s genotype was independently determined using three utilities these genotypes were found to be in agreement with the exception of minor differences resulting from the presence of allelic_variants in the s genotype that are not present in all repertoires and misalignment of very infrequently rearranged genes the inferred rearrangeable v d and j genes of the s genome are available as supplementary tables s s and s respectively s carries an apparent homozygous_deletion of six contiguous d genes and is homozygous at the five other d loci where allelic_variants exist the ighd gene which we have previously_suggested is non functional was also absent from the s genome these features make the s dataset particularly useful for the evaluation of utility performance on d gene alignment the alignment of d genes is one of the most difficult challenges in the partitioning of vdj rearrangements and the nature of the challenge varies between d gene_families the output from each utility was compared with the s genotype and all errors were noted the results for each utility are summarised asand detailed as supplementary tables s s overall errors were made in the alignment of between ihmmunealign and ab origin of all sequences six unofficial v polymorphisms previously inferred from sequence_analysis are seen in the s genome these polymorphisms were present in of all s vdj genes according to the ihmmune align analysis while failures to identify these polymorphisms were not scored as errors here unless alignment utility repertoires incorporate these newly_identified polymorphisms an additional source of substantial error will remain analysis using the stanford s dataset demonstrates how sequence_datasets can be used to evaluate the performance of igh alignment utilities analysis found the fewest definitive misassignments of the igh genes for ihmmune align joinsolver and igblast this approach should now allow the performance of all utilities to be further refined
