structural_bioinformatics networkview d display and analysis of protein rna interaction networks networkview is an application for the display and analysis of protein rna interaction networks derived from structure and or dynamics these networks typically model individual protein residues and nucleic_acid monomers as nodes and their pairwise contacts as edges with associated weights networkview projects the network onto the underlying d molecular_structure so that visualization and analysis of the network can be coupled to physical and biological_properties networkview is implemented as a plugin to the molecular_visualization software vmd the usefulness of d contact network_visualization in the study of protein_function has already been demonstrated leading to the development of software to display these networks the networkview extension to the visual molecular_dynamics vmd program was developed to help structural biologists study allostery and molecular_signaling through network models of protein_rna in translation residues essential for molecular_recognition and reaction_mechanisms at different states of the system can be determined by using molecular_dynamics md_simulations to calculate variations in contacts and displaying the resulting interaction networks and their properties directly onto the d structure as networks are increasingly used to study the function and dynamics of biological_macromolecules the informative display of network data directly onto d representations of biomolecules is needed networkview provides high_level interactive views of dynamic and or structure networks that enable the analysis and interpretation of molecular_signaling projection of these networks onto d biomolecular structures is useful for rapidly identifying residues which can be targeted in mutagenesis experiments to test mechanistic hypotheses
