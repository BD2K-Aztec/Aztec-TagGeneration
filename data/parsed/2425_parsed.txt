induction of t cell memory by a dendritic_cell vaccine a computational_model motivation although results from phase_iii substantially support the use of prophylactic and therapeutic_vaccines against cancer what has yet to be defined is how many and how frequent boosts are needed to sustain a long_lasting and protecting memory t cell response against tumor_antigens common experience is that such preclinical tests require the sacrifice of a relatively large number of animals and are particularly time and money consuming results as a first step to overcome these hurdles we have developed an ordinary_differential that includes all relevant entities such as activated cytotoxic_t and memory t cells and investigated the induction of immunological memory in the context of wild_type injected with a dendritic_cell based vaccine we have simulated the biological_behavior both in the presence and in the absence of memory t cells comparing results of ex_vivo and in silico experiments we show that the model is able to envisage the expansion and persistence of antigen_specific memory t cells the model might be applicable to more complex vaccination schedules and substantially in any biological condition of prime boosting in the past_years both therapeutic and preventive vaccines have been developed with the aim to fight and prevent different types of cancers the power of vaccines relies on their ability to stimulate a strong and long_lasting antigen_specific immune_response mediated both by b and t lymphocytes although induction of a protective titer of neutralizing_antibodies is the main objective of most of the vaccines against infectious_agents including vaccines to carcinogenic human_papillomavirus and hepatitis_b which also protect from cervical and liver_cancer respectively evidence in humans that antibodies induced by a vaccine can contribute to antitumor_immunity is scanty conversely the major_goal of both prophylactic and therapeutic_vaccines against non infectious tumors which account for of all tumors is to induce a long_lasting antigen_specific t cell immunity in support of this concept high_densities of effector_memory cytotoxic t cells are associated with a longer overall survival in several human_cancers usually an effective vaccine requires multiple immunizations in the form of prime_boost several studies have shown that boosting with a different vector carrying the same antigen is better at enhancing immune_responses than boosting with the homologous vector the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is still obscure heterologous prime_boost approaches are now widely used in efforts to develop vaccines it is also generally_accepted that a strong primary_immune is required to give rise to a large_pool of memory cells however what affects the longevity of memory t cells is not fully understood and much controversy_exists regarding the role of antigens in this process sustained high amounts of soluble_antigens often lead to tolerance or exhaustion both in t and b cells as a result of exhaustion antigen_specific t and b cells express a variety of inhibitory_receptors such as pd lag cd cd tim and ctla dendritic_cell dc based_vaccines have been extensively investigated as potential cancer therapeutic_vaccines because of the primary role of dcs as antigen_presenting apcs and their unique ability in t cell priming dcs pulsed with the antigen of choice induce a potent antigen_specific immune_response and favor the generation of the memory pool this stems from the asymmetric_division of engaged naive t cells into effector and memory cells several phase_ii based on the use of dcs pulsed with tumor_associated are ongoing moreover sipuleucel_t an autologous apc based vaccine has been the first vaccine approved by the food_and for the treatment of cancer patients in a phase_iii in patients affected by castration_resistant sipuleucel_t gave a month benefit in overall survival relative to a control_arm that to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as received unpulsed apcs however no significant effects on the time to objective disease_progression were observed these promising results also suggest that some fundamental biological_questions remain_unanswered for dc based_vaccines it is not yet known whether booster immunizations should consist of dcs or other means it has been reported that antigenbearing dcs are rapidly eliminated by antigen_specific cytotoxic_t ctls when injected in previously vaccinated_mice therefore arguing for a reduced effectiveness of dc based boosts observed in the gl model that dcs are essential for the priming but they are less effective than tumor cell_lysate alone in boosting the antitumor_immune and for the induction of long_term immune_memory another unsolved issue is the frequency of boosting it has been reported that repeated immunizations result in increased frequencies of memory t cells however overstimulation can drive memory t cells toward terminal_differentiation such as activation_induced fratricide or exhaustion to address these biological issues we started analyzing the ability of dc based_vaccines to induce a long_lasting antigenspecific immune_response in mice as immunological readout of antigen primed and functional t cells we measured the interferon_gamma ifn contained in sera of vaccinated_mice and the frequency of cd cd t cells able to release ifn upon ex_vivo specific antigen challenge preliminary_experiments suggested that to optimize the best boosting strategy we would have had to set many experiments each lasting several months to investigate these biological_problems as a first step we began by setting up an in silico model capable to describe the biological_phenomena observed in the animal_model the aim of the model is to verify the memory t cell induction hypothesis by a dc based vaccine observed in vivo and to give new suggestions on the designing of boosting strategies during the past_decades several approaches have been devoted to model the immune system or parts of it with mathematical equation based models_representing the largest slice among these approaches differential_equation based models usually reproduce the dynamics of the average concentrations of the immune systeminvolved entities over time to obtain the main aspects of the immune_response simple models based on systems of ordinary or partial_differential can be easily analyzed to obtain for example asymptotic behaviors on the other hand for more complex scenarios it is usually difficult to build complex ordinary_differential ode based models as well as incorporate new aspects the trade_off between an accurate biological representation and the mathematical feasibility may lead to biologically useless models or to mathematically intractable models cellular_automata ca or agent_based represent a large class of discrete modeling techniques where each entity is followed individually and global behaviors are obtained from local behaviors of all involved entities in this way it is possible to model the immune system in much more detail allowing it to determine behavior distribution and not just the average moreover it is easy to add and remove new entities and nonlinear interactions to expand or update the model to the last biological_insights leaving the problem computationally_tractable cellular_automata and agent_based can be successfully used to simulate without any problems the receptor diversity of the immune repertoire opening the door to natural scale simulations an example of approaches in this direction is discussed in however even such approaches have their own flaws because of the lack of a solid mathematical theory they miss tools allowing any asymptotic analysis and require considerable computational power to simulate individual agents in particular for large_scale simulations some good review_articles that can introduce the reader to the modeling techniques of the immune system are presented in and perelson and weisbuch the problem we are dealing with requires the ability to uniquely represent the immune_response of ctls specific for the immunodominant tag iv antigen from the oncovirus sv and also in vivo measurements refer to this this is a valid argument for supporting the assumption that a monoclonal model based on ode described in this article can be considered_adequate the ode model includes all the relevant entities such as activated ctls and memory t cells needed to confirm the presence of immunological memory we simulated the biological_behavior in the presence and in the absence of memory t cells our in silico model showed the ability to predict the dimension of the immune_response induced in mice by dc vaccination and allowed us to define the relative_contribution of several parameters i e memory cell_differentiation and death_rates and naive cell recovery_rate to the success of the prime_boost strategy it also predicted the role of the second injection boost over the pool of memory t cells nevertheless it allowed the identification of a time window in which boosts may be detrimental supplementary data s these findings appear to be consistent with data reported by us and we have demonstrated that boosting healthy_mice every weeks instead of every month hindered persistence of ifn competent memory cd t cells in addition when vaccinated_mice were challenged with melanoma_cells of the mice that had received a monthly boosting rejected the tumor conversely mice treated with tighter vaccination schedules survived similarly to non boosted mice and remarkably less than mice boosted every month one of the advantages of the system is that several entities and variables can be added each time as an example it might be interesting to investigate the role of endogenous dcs and the antigen formulation e g synthetic_peptide protein or cell fragment in t cell priming induced by the vaccine it has been reported that the requirement of antigen transfer to endogenous apcs for in vivo ctl priming by dc based_vaccines may depend on the antigen formulation furthermore by adding the characteristic of the patient e g age sex weight general_health stage of cancer comorbidities and medications a personalized vaccination schedule might be generated one limitation of the reported data is that they were obtained modeling a healthy_subject and therefore they are applicable only for the design of preventive vaccines the system needs to be challenged against more stringent biological_contexts such as in the presence of minimal_residual or bulky tumors our recent findings_suggest that tumor_antigens released from the tumor as a consequence of either the tumor cell_turnover or the immune attack already boost memory t cells induced by vaccine priming and vaccine boosts may be detrimental on the other hand the model does not take into account the regulation of t cell longevity and the peculiarities of the antigens these issues appear important and future version of the model could incorporate them as wet experiments reveal their roles an additional limit of the study is that it is entirely based on mouse data there are no published clinical_trials in which different vaccination schedules have been compared with induction of long_lasting antitumor_immunity most of the vaccination protocols tested so_far in cancer patients stemmed from the experience with prophylactic_vaccines against infectious_diseases which are dissimilar to non infectious tumors thus reliable preclinical_models are needed to investigate the therapeutic_efficacy of cancer_vaccines mice are the experimental tool of choice for the majority of tumor immunologists because of the remarkable similarities between mouse and human immune system nevertheless significant differences exist between mice and humans in immune system development cell_subpopulations of both the innate and adaptive arms and perception of endogenous and exogenous activation_signals this should sound a word of caution to avoid over interpreting_results obtained in mouse_models due to the fact that information is also available for humans on the six different populations we used to develop the related odes our model might be easily tested in the human context and provide useful information for dc based cancer_vaccines importance of the second injection over the pool of memory ctls predicted by the mathematical_model in
