optimally discriminative subnetwork markers predict response to chemotherapy motivation molecular_profiles of tumour_samples have been widely and successfully used for classification_problems a number of algorithms have been proposed to predict classes of tumor_samples based on expression_profiles with relatively high performance however prediction of response to cancer treatment has proved to be more challenging and novel approaches with improved generalizability are still highly needed recent_studies have clearly demonstrated the advantages of integrating proteinprotein_interaction ppi data with gene_expression for the development of subnetwork markers in classification_problems results we describe a novel network based classification algorithm optdis using color coding technique to identify optimally discriminative subnetwork markers focusing on ppi_networks we apply our algorithm to drug response studies we evaluate our algorithm using published cohorts of breast_cancer patients treated with combination_chemotherapy we show that our optdis method improves over previously_published subnetwork methods and provides better and more stable performance compared with other subnetwork and single gene methods we also show that our subnetwork method_produces predictive_markers that are more reproducible across independent cohorts and offer valuable insight into biological_processes underlying response to therapy in the treatment of cancers patients presenting tumors with similar clinical_characteristics will often respond differentially to the same chemotherapy vant in fact for many types of cancer only a minority of treated patients will observe regression of tumor_growth this is the case for both conventional chemotherapeutic_agents and newer targeted_therapies that affect specific molecules to achieve an effective cancer treatment it is critical to identify the underlying_mechanisms that confer chemoresistance in some tumors but not others the advent of genome_wide technologies has allowed the discovery of novel biomarkers for cancer diagnosis prognosis and treatment vant while some progress has been made toward identifying reliable prognostic_markers for breast and other cancers development of molecular_markers predictive of response to chemotherapy has proved to be far more difficult vant in recent_years a number of studies have used genome_wide to identify genes that could be used as predictors of drug response in breast_cancer in these studies single gene marker methods were used where each gene is individually ranked for differential_expression and the top genes were selected as predictors known as single gene markers additional study required single gene markers not only to be differentially_expressed but also to have similar coexpression between the training and test cohorts while some of these predictive_markers have_shown in a limited number of patient_cohorts many of these signatures have failed to achieve_similar performance in additional validation_studies in addition single gene markers developed from different cohorts have been shown to have very little overlap a further limitation of single gene markers is that they provide relatively limited insight into the biological_mechanisms response to drug response thus predictive_markers with robust performance greater reproducibility and improved insights into drug actionwhich are critical for clinical applicationstill remains_elusive previous_studies have observed that gene_products associated with cancer tend to be highly clustered in coexpression_networks and have more interactions inspired by this observation introduced the use of all members of a proteinprotein_interaction ppi subnetwork as a metagene marker for predicting metastasis in breast_cancer demonstrated that subnetwork markers are more robust i e their results tend to provide more reproducible results across different cohorts of patients motivated by the limitations in predicting drug response using single gene markers and the better performance promised by subnetwork markers this article aims to identify subnetwork markers to predict chemotherapeutic response as detailed below defined subnetwork activity as the aggregate expression of genes in a given subnetwork the discriminative score of a subnetworkwhich reflects how well the subnetwork discriminates samples of different phenotypes or classes was derived from mutual_information between subnetwork activity and the phenotype the study presented greedy algorithms for identifying subnetworks with the highest discriminative scores andpage i i i
