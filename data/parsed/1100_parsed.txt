computational clustering for viral reference proteomes motivation the enormous_number of redundant sequenced_genomes has hindered efforts to analyze and functionally annotate proteins as the taxonomy of viruses is not uniformly defined viral proteomes pose special challenges in this regard grouping viruses based on the similarity of their proteins at proteome scale can normalize against potential taxonomic nomenclature anomalies results we present viral reference proteomes viral rps which are computed from complete virus proteomes within uniprotkb viral rps based on and co membership in proteome similarity based clusters are provided comparison of our computational viral rps with uniprots curator selected reference proteomes indicates that the two sets are consistent and complementary furthermore each viral rp represents a cluster of virus proteomes that was consistent with virus or host taxonomy we provide blastp search and ftp download of viral rp protein_sequences and a browser to facilitate the visualization of viral rps availability_and http proteininformationresource org rps viruses there are existing_methods for reducing protein sequence_space ncbi nr ncbi resource clusters identical proteins while unirefs provide clustered protein_sequences at multiple similarity levels ncbi refseq and uniprots reference proteomes provide users with the ability to perform analyses or create protein_families using a limited set of complete proteomes selected by curators however such approaches are difficult to scale up and do not show the relationships between organisms previously we created representative proteomes rps by clustering archaea bacteria and eukaryota proteomes into related groups and selecting a representative organism from each group compared to unirefs clustering which is based on the similarity of individual proteins rps clustering is based on the similarity of whole proteomes these computationally determined rps are now included in the uniprot reference proteome set however viral proteomes posed special challenges as the taxonomy for viruses is not uniformly defined potentially there are taxonomic nomenclature variations resulting from naming more distantly_related viruses as if they were the same genus or by naming closely_related viruses as if they were in different taxonomic clades to address those challenges we clustered virus proteomes based on the similarity of their overall protein_sequences in a proteome scale using algorithms that can reliably and quickly calculate a hierarchical set of viral reference proteomes viral rps at different co membership cut_offs specifically the clustering of the virus proteomes starts at very high similarity level in order to identify the proteomes that are very similar to other proteomes or proteomes that are an identical subset of other proteomes sub proteomes in addition we incorporate the uniprotkb annotation score http www uniprot org help annotation score into our proteome priority score pps
