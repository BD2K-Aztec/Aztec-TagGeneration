clustering based model of cysteine co evolution improves disulfide_bond connectivity prediction and reduces homologous sequence_requirements motivation cysteine_residues have particular structural and functional_relevance in proteins because of their ability to form covalent disulfide_bonds bioinformatics_tools that can accurately_predict cysteine bonding states are already available whereas it remains_challenging to infer the disulfide connectivity pattern of unknown protein_sequences improving accuracy in this area is highly_relevant for the structural and functional_annotation of proteins results we predict the intra chain disulfide_bond connectivity patterns starting from known cysteine bonding states with an evolutionary based unsupervised approach_called sephiroth that relies on high_quality alignments obtained with hhblits and is based on a coarse_grained cluster based mode lization of tandem cysteine mutations within a protein_family we compared our method with state of the art unsupervised predictors and achieve a performance improvement of while requiring an order of magnitude less of aligned homologous_sequences instead of availability_and the software described in this article and the datasets used are available at http ibsquare be sephiroth cysteine amino_acids are extremely relevant for proteins from both structural and functional perspectives their side chain ends in a thiol group that in an oxidative environment may covalently bond with other cysteines to form disulfide_bonds within the protein or to other proteins these non local_interactions pose structural constraints that reduce the conformational freedom of proteins thus affecting their stability maturation and folding_rate inducing conformational changes and ultimately influencing their function next_generation is producing a flood of new and unannotated protein_sequences there are commonly two prediction steps that can be taken to annotate cysteines in these sequences the first one is to predict whether their thiol group is in a bound oxidized or free reduced state which can help in the functional and structural_characterization of proteins the second one is to reconstruct the most probable disulfide_bonding pattern which represents the connectivity of the covalent_bonds formed between the oxidized cysteines within one sequence intra chain this prediction step is important asknowledge of these connectivities provides clues to the protein fold and structural_similarity to other proteins and in ab_initio structure_prediction it adds long_range constraints and reduces the conformational_space to be searched most of the state of the art prediction_tools follow this division in two steps depending on the case they can deal with the oxidation_states alone the connectivity prediction alone and thus assuming perfect knowledge of the which is the ultimate_goal of this field rubinstein and fiser already observed that methods for the prediction of cysteine oxidation_states have a long history of high performances more than years_ago of accuracy was already reached and recently of cysteines were correctly_classified with of proteins predicted correctly these approaches are distinct from the prediction of disulfide_bond connectivity where typically accuracies of up to are reached starting from known oxidation_states the machine_learning ml methods commonly used to predict connectivity can be improved by coupling them with statistical_approaches based on the analysis of correlated_mutations between cysteine positions in multiple_sequence msas as shown in the information produced by these statistical_approaches is to a certain extent orthogonal and thus complementary to ml methods which can natively integrate these predictions as new dimensions in the feature_vectors in particular show that correlated cysteine mutation analysis can provide a improvement over ml performances the principle underlying methods based on the statistical_analysis of msas is that generally residues that experience spatial_proximity in the three_dimensional protein_structure tend to coevolve during the evolution of protein_families so preserving the propensity of their interaction bonded cysteines are no exception to this behavior their structural and functional_relevance leaves a co evolutionary trace among the cysteine harboring positions in an msa of homologous_sequences in the form of tandem compensatory mutations between contacting pairs evolution thus provides msas with clues of the protein three_dimensional structure but this coevolutionary signal is confounded by the entanglement of spurious transitive network mediated correlations and entropic phylogenetic biases mostly due to the sampling of the sequences during alignment different algorithms have been developed to extract the valuable co evolutionary signal from its noisy background and are routinely used in contact_prediction cp compared with the more general cp problem the disulfide connectivity prediction presents a problem of lesser difficulty because i only a few positions in the msa have to be analyzed and ii cysteines are expected to have a structural or functional impact and thus a strong correlation trace through evolution disulfide connectivities have been predicted from msas this way using correlated mutation analysis methods and using a mutual_information mi approach combined with a sparse inverse covariance estimation method derived from the cp tool psicov so improving the performances of their full annotation predictor although these approaches are effective they do not take into account for example the evolutionary_distances between the sequences or any biological reasoning except for the compensatory mutation process here we address this problem through sephiroth an unsupervised predictor that infers the most likely intra chain disulfide_bond connectivity patterns starting from known or predicted cysteine bonding states sephiroth i relies on high_quality msas obtained with the fast and accurate hidden_markov alignment_method hhblits and ii is based on a novel coarse_grained cluster based modelization of tandem cysteines mutations within a protein_family we compared our method with state of the art unsupervised predictors on the same dataset and achieve a performance improvement of while requiring an order of magnitude fewer aligned homologous_sequences in the order of instead of thus extending the applicability of these tools in terms of increased range of predictable sequences at a lower computational_cost sephiroth can be combined with ml methods and in this case provides a improvement compared with other state of the art supervised prediction_methods in this article we present a novel unsupervised method for the prediction of disulfide_bond connectivity patterns from known or predicted cysteine bonding states it is based on assumptions similar to other statistical_methods cysteine conservation and co evolution but approaches the problem from a different angle directly encoding the cysteine tandem mutations assumption in the structure underlying the problem thus providing constraints for the search of the optimal solutions the availability of homologous_sequences is crucial for these predictors and we adopted a fast and accurate hmm_based iterative search tool hhblits to obtain small but highly informative msas compared with existing predictors we obtain a significant_improvement of the performances while requiring one order of magnitude fewer aligned homologs we also show that sephiroth can provide a relevant improvement over stateof the art ml methods if used as extra feature in svr pipelines for solving the disulfide connectivity prediction task the enhanced reliability of the connectivity predictions coupled with lower requirements in terms of msa sizes and thus time required by database_search can improve the dependability of bioinformatics_methods for the structural and functional_annotation of unknown sequences
