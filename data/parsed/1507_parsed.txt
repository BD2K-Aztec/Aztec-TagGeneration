dynamic deterministic_effects propagation networks learning signalling_pathways from longitudinal protein array data motivation network modelling in systems_biology has become an important tool to study molecular_interactions in cancer research because understanding the interplay of proteins is necessary for developing novel drugs and therapies de_novo reconstruction of signalling_pathways from data allows to unravel interactions between proteins and make qualitative statements on possible aberrations of the cellular regulatory program we present a new method for reconstructing signalling_networks from time course experiments after external perturbation and show an application of the method to data measuring abundance of phosphorylated proteins in a human_breast generated on reverse_phase protein arrays results signalling dynamics is modelled using active and passive states for each protein at each timepoint a fixed signal propagation scheme generates a set of possible state_transitions on a discrete timescale for a given network hypothesis reducing the number of theoretically reachable states a likelihood_score is proposed describing the probability of measurements given the states of the proteins over time the optimal sequence of state_transitions is found via a hidden_markov and network_structure search is performed using a genetic_algorithm that optimizes the overall likelihood of a population of candidate networks our method shows increased performance compared with two different dynamical bayesian_network approaches for our real_data we were able to find several known signalling_cascades from the erbb signalling_pathway availability dynamic deterministic_effects propagation networks is implemented in the r programming_language and available atstudying the molecular_biology of cells and tissues has developed from the investigation of few genes or proteins in one experiment to the analysis of the interplay of many components as a system various array techniques have been devised for analysing cellular behaviour on dna rna and protein level that make it possible to generate thousands of measurements in a single experiment these data can be plugged into de_novo network_reconstruction methods in order to infer regulatory_interactions between the measured components for this purpose several approaches have been developed in the past to whom correspondence should be addressed bayesian_networks bn have been frequently used to reconstruct gene_regulatory from rna expression experiments as well as causal proteinprotein relationships for intensity data from protein quantification the latter is an example where directed perturbations of several measured proteins were performed in order to resolve the structure of the underlying interactions external interventions can be introduced by multiple means for example changing_environmental applying drugs or using gene_silencing methods such as rna_interference another example for bn usage under perturbation conditions is given in besides bns there are several related approaches to infer networks from perturbation data derived networks after knocking out specific genes by analysing expression_patterns in the discretized gene_expression extended this approach to perform inference on nondiscretized expression levels suggested iterative perturbation of the system in order to reveal the underlying network_structure they modelled perturbations as a linear combination of inputs and inferred weights for the pairwise node to node influences improved this idea by using nonlinear perturbation_effects and modelled the interaction behaviour of a number of components after several single and combinatorial perturbations time resolved measurements provide insight into the dynamical behaviour of the system and do not restrict modelling to a snapshot of the systems state a suitable approach for network_inference from time resolved data are dynamic_bayesian dbn a family of reconstruction methods including boolean_network statespace models or regression_models while these methods model the dynamics of the system over time they do not model perturbation_effects directly however studied reverse_engineering methods on simulated_data for time courses and external_perturbations and came to the conclusion that additional perturbation of the system is beneficial so methods that explicitly include perturbations in the modelling approach for time course analysis are still needed in addition most of the current network_reconstruction methods are tailored to the analysis of gene_regulatory based on gene_expression data from microarray_experiments rather few studies deal with the signalling flow between proteins based on the analysis of protein activation and abundance coupled with intervention effects developed a network inference_method for protein networks after knockdown of the measured components that allowsof the approach given a network hypothesis a we generate a set of reachable system states by applying a fixed signal propagation scheme b which in effect reduces the number of possible system states an optimal path through these reachable system states over time is identified by an hmm c using the series of system states from the hmm model_parameters for two gaussian_distributions for each protein one for active one for passive are estimated d and a total likelihood of our measurements given the network and model_parameters is calculated e we use this likelihood_score in a ga in order to optimize the overall score for an evolving population of candidate networks f and generate a final network from this population after we found convergence in the ga time series measurements too but their method treats each time point as independent measurement and does not model the timedependent behaviour of the system explicitly however using only few perturbations and gathering information on the signal flow through longer time series would be desirable too in this study we set up a framework for reconstructing signalling_networks from time course measurements after external perturbation both inhibitory and stimulating shows an outline of the proposed workflow networks are represented as directed cyclic graphs with distinct edge types for activating and inhibiting interactions we model signalling dynamics by a boolean signal propagation mechanism defining state_transitions for a given network_structure an optimal state_transition series is found in a hidden_markov hmm and the fit of the data to such a transition_matrix is assessed by our proposed likelihood_score network_structure search is performed in a genetic_algorithm ga optimizing the overall likelihood of a population of candidate networks our method shows good performance for reconstructing signalling_networks from artificial data and outperforms two current dbn approaches as an application of the algorithm we used protein_phosphorylation measurements for erbb signalling related phosphoproteins the data were generated on reverse_phase protein arrays rppa in the human_breast hcc which overexpresses the erbb receptor that is associated with reduced disease_free in breast_cancer patients note that dynamic deterministic_effects propagation networks ddepn was developed for protein_phosphorylation data but in principle is also applicable to other types of high_throughput data e g for rna microarrays we stimulated the cells with two ligands epidermal_growth egf and heregulin hrg both as separate and combined_stimulation experiments all three experiments were combined to infer a signalling network which was compared with current_literature knowledge ddepn was able to identify several well known signalling chains from the mapk and akt signalling_pathways some of which originally were found in erbb overexpressing_cells this shows the ability of our method to identify meaningful interactions from experimental proteomics_data
