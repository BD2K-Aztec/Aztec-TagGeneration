structural_bioinformatics sequence_based gaussian network model for protein dynamics motivation gaussian network model gnm is widely_adopted to analyze and understand protein dynamics function and conformational changes the existing gnm based_approaches require atomic_coordinates of the corresponding protein and cannot be used when only the sequence is known results we report first of its kind gnm model that allows modeling using the sequence our linear regression_based parameter free sequence derived gnm l pfseqgnm uses contact_maps predicted from the sequence and models local in the sequence contact neighborhoods with the linear_regression empirical benchmarking shows relatively high correlations between the native and the predicted with l pfseqgnm b factors and between the cross correlations of residue fluctuations derived from the structure and the sequence_based gnm models our results demonstrate that l pfseqgnm is an attractive platform to explore protein dynamics in contrast to the highly used gnms that require protein_structures that number in thousands our model can be used to study motions for the millions of the readily available sequences which finds applications in modeling conformational changes proteinprotein_interactions and protein functions protein dynamics which is associated with ever present thermal_fluctuations of atoms and other types of motions that span between rapid picoseconds vibrations and relatively slow microseconds to seconds movements implements various important biological_processes and functions the x_ray studies provide information about the thermal motion which is represented by the debyewaller temperature factors or b factors b factors are proportional to the mean square fluctuations of atomic positions in a crystal due to the thermal motion and positional disorder they have been studied from a variety of viewpoints in the context of protein_function and their relation with conformational changes on proteinprotein_interactions to name just a few consequently the knowledge of b factors provides important insights into the functional dynamics of proteins several computational and physical_models have been proposed to predict the b factors from protein_structures electron_density and sequences to overcome the high_computational of molecular_dynamic several structure based computational_approaches such as the coarse_grained models including normal_mode elastic network model enm packing_density and weighted contact number were developed the enms including the isotropic gaussian network model gnm and the anisotropic network model define spring like interactions between residues that are within a certain cutoff distance they simplify the computationally_costly all atom potentials into a quadratic function in the vicinity of the native_state which allows the decomposition of the motions into vibrational_modes with different frequencies which are known as normal_modes they can determine the concerted collective motions of residues that correspond to the lowest frequency modes comprising large_parts of a given protein being simple and efficient enm and gnm have been widely_applied to study many motion problems such as the molecular_mechanisms of the groel_groes function motor protein_motions and general conformational changes and functions moreover several variations of the classical enms i e the classical gnms and anisotropic network models have been developed for better modeling of protein dynamics however these methods require the knowledge of protein_structure which limits their applications to thousands of known structures in contrast to the millions of known non redundant protein_sequences the sequence_based predictors use only the protein_sequences as their input and thus they are suitable for the analysis of the to whom correspondence should be addressed this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons http

with unknown structures applied support_vector to predict the b factors using positionspecific scoring_matrix generated from the input_sequence proposed a neural_network model that uses evolutionary_information and solvent_accessibility that are generated and predicted from the input chain respectively used the linear_regression to investigate the local impact of solvent_accessibility on the residue flexibility recently developed a random_forest based model that uses the input_sequence and the predicted_secondary and solvent_accessibility andused a sequence fragment matching based_approach to model the protein_flexibility nevertheless the main_drawback of these sequence_based predictors is that they predict only the b factor values of the c atoms and they do not provide the information about the collective motions motivated by recent_advances in high_throughput and lagging of the current structure_determination pipelines a sequence_based model would be invaluable to advance_our of protein motion and flexibility we address this need by proposing a novel sequence_based gnm seqgnm that uses contact_maps predicted from the sequences with the nncon method furthermore inspired by a finding that strength of the relation between solvent_accessibility and flexibility of residues improves when considering a local neighborhood in the sequence and the development of the local contact density model we enhance seqgnm by using a linear_regression that quantifies relation between the local predicted contacts and the flexibility we illustrate the benefits of the seqgnm by applying it to predict b factors and collective motions of residues we demonstrate that results from seqgnm are comparable with the outputs from the structure based gnms the b factors reflect the residue fluctuations and static dynamic and lattice disorders however they depend on the experimental resolution crystal contacts and refinement procedures which is why the b factor profiles of homologous protein are shown to be correlated with each other with the acc of this constitutes an approximate upper_limit for the prediction of the b factor values which applies to the considered gnm based models have recently_proposed a new distance_dependent parameter free gnm in which residue pairs are weighted by the inverse square of their distances this pfgnm method had been shown to outperform the classical distance cutoff based gnm in prediction the b factors here the proposed seqgnm methods pfseqgnm and l pfseqgnm predict the b factors with comparably to the structure based method high correlations equal and on the pdb dataset and and on the pdb the native b factors and the b factors predicted with the gnm pfgnm pfseqgnm and l pfseqgnm methods for a

fluctuations for the lactoglobulin protein pdbid b e chain a computed with a gnm b pfgnm c pfseqgnm and d l pfseqgnm methods the colors range between red strong_positive and blue strong negative correlations the maps of the cross correlations of residue fluctuations for the histamine binding_protein ra hbp pdbid qft chain a computed with a gnm b pfgnm c pfseqgnm and d l pfseqgnm methods the colors range between red strong_positive and blue strong negative correlations the maps of the cross correlations of residue fluctuations for the quorum_sensing protein tram pdbid upg chain a computed with a gnm b pfgnm c pfseqgnm and d l pfseqgnm methods the colors range between red strong_positive and blue strong negative correlations dataset respectively we demonstrate that the pfgnm is also advantageous for our sequence based_approach i e we show that the pfseqgnm outperforms the classical seqgnms furthermore motivated by the findings concerning the impact of local contact density and local solvent_accessibility on the residue flexibility expressed with the b factors we use linear_regression to model the relation between the local predicted contacts and the residue flexibility this led to the development of an improved pfseqgnm that uses the local contacts which is called l pfseqgnm our empirical results suggest that this model provides useful predictions of the residue flexibility and the collective residue motions the key_advantage of the seqgnm is that it can be applied to proteins with unknown structures and known sequences which number in millions in contrast the existing and widely_adopted structure based gnms are limited to a much smaller subpopulation of proteins with known structure our model finds numerous applications in modeling of protein motion conformational changes proteinprotein_interactions and protein functions to name just a few
