jointsnvmix a probabilistic_model for accurate detection of somatic_mutations in normal tumour paired next_generation identification of somatic single_nucleotide snvs in tumour genomes is a necessary step in defining the mutational landscapes of cancers experimental_designs for genome_wide ascertainment of somatic_mutations now routinely include next_generation ngs of tumour dna and matched constitutional dna from the same individual this allows investigators to control for germline polymorphisms and distinguish somatic_mutations that are unique to the tumour thus reducing the burden of labour_intensive and expensive downstream experiments needed to verify initial predictions in order to make full use of such paired datasets computational_tools for simultaneous analysis of tumournormal paired sequence_data are required but are currently underdeveloped and under represented in the bioinformatics literature results in this contribution we introduce two novel probabilistic_graphical called jointsnvmix and jointsnvmix for jointly analysing paired tumournormal digital allelic count_data from ngs experiments in contrast to independent analysis of the tumour and normal data our method allows statistical strength to be borrowed across the samples and therefore amplifies the statistical_power to identify and distinguish both germline and somatic events in a unified probabilistic_framework availability the jointsnvmix models and four other models discussed in the article are part of the jointsnvmix software_package available for download at http in this article we examined the problem of simultaneous analysis of tumournormal pair ngs_data for the purpose of identifying somatic_point we developed a probabilistic_framework called jointsnvmix to allow us to benchmark a model that can borrow statistical strength between samples against standard independent analysis we showed that joint modelling of genotypes confers an increased specificity over simpler or independent analysis section interestingly the frequentist statistics based method joint fisher method which considers both datasets simultaneously shows an increased specificity over its independentanalogue albeit considerably_lower than what was achieved for jointsnvmix
