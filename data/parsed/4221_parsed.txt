databases_and sharing and executing linked data queries in a collaborative environment motivation life_sciences have emerged as a key domain in the linked data community because of the diversity of data semantics and formats available through a great variety of databases and web technologies thus it has been used as the perfect domain for applications in the web of data unfortunately bioinformaticians are not exploiting the full potential of this already available technology and experts in life_sciences have real problems to discover understand and devise how to take advantage of these interlinked integrated data results in this article we present bioqueries a wiki based portal that is aimed at community building around biological linked data this tool has been designed to aid bioinformaticians in developing sparql queries to access biological_databases exposed as linked data and also to help biologists gain a deeper insight into the potential use of this technology this public space offers several services and a collaborative infrastructure to stimulate the consumption of biological linked data and therefore contribute to implementing the benefits of the web of data in this domain bioqueries currently contains query entries grouped by database and theme registered users and end_points that contain biological resource_description information availability the bioqueries portal is freely_accessible at http bioquthe amount of information on the world_wide has increased during the past_few the way that we share and access this information has been especially altered by the lowering of the barriers to access and publish documents and data and applications have difficulties in reusing this information because of data and format heterogeneity and the lack of formal descriptions of their meaning semantics in an effort to address the problems derived from the heterogeneity and the lack of semantics linked data has emerged linked data is commonly defined as a set of best practices with the objective of connecting sharing and exposing data and knowledge the underlying technology supported by an active community encourages the application of standards i the use of http uris ii the sparql query_language and iii resource_description rdf and web_ontology owl for data modelling of data and representation this technology has encouraged the publication of interlinked datasets which in turn has caused a huge increase in the linked data cloud in the past_few datasets in contained billion rdf triples and million rdf links in september this amount had reached billion rdf triples which were interlinked by means of million rdf links latest update the linked data community has produced many tools to take advantage of these data such as rdf editors e g vapour browsers e g tabulator search_engines and semantic_web search machines e g watson with millions of triples indexed however despite the rapid_growth of data and the availability of developed tools there are some problems in the development of applications closer to end_users specifically in the life_sciences domain where there has been a rapid_growth in the amount of biological biochemical and medical data in recent_years for this reason we have developed a web_tool called bioqueries that uses linked data technology in the life_sciences domain and which has been designed for biological and bioinformatic endusers in the life_sciences domain available linked data tools are not usually targeted at biologists because they do not take into account end_user usability to address this there have been some attempts to improve the application of this technology to the biological domain bio rdf is a semantic web_application designed to solve the integration problem in the bioinformatic area bio rdf integrates data from the most popular databases such as uniprot omim kegg reactome and so forth this mash up system offers a graphical_interface in which users obtain the information in rdf keyword based searches and it also provides sparql end_points linked life data lld is another integration project that stores billions of biomedical rdf statements in the life_sciences and health_care domains the lld group implemented rdf representation of pubmed umls entrez_gene and open biological and biomedical_ontologies obo_foundry data_sources furthermore it provides three ways to access the data a web_interface to introduce sparql queries a browser to explore the information and a graphical visualization_tool this platform is similar to bio rdf project and offers the same features the uniprot consortium has also made a contribution and has published their knowledge_base as linked data it offers several end_points to be queried the bio rdf end_point and the end_point provided by the uniprot website the linking open drug data lodd was built around the need to integrate large_amounts of biomedical data from different data_sources because of the development of new therapies for diseases this project stores million triples and links to external sources and is an important framework that interconnects different data from linked clinical_trials dataset drugbank tcmgenedit and diseaome in the approaches cited bio rdf lld uniprot and lodd the main goal is to publish helpful end_points to provide direct access to the data however they are unconnected islands of knowledge that are at best linked bioqueries addresses the problem that users have in locating and using such places of information bioqueries provides a central repository of queries that access distributed end_points therefore bioqueries is not concerned with the publication of data as such but rather sparql queries for retrieving such data in the biological domain biologists are conscious of the importance of interactive wikis in solving the problem of large_scale data management even with the implicit inconsistencies in published and commonly_accepted data in the literature the idea of using wikis in life_sciences was born with the objective of the visualization of intracellular biosignalling pathways to promote biocuration and interactivity between biological users the biological wikis are based on the wikipedia idea where users can edit online with the intention of helping biologists handle large_amounts of information on genes proteins transcripts and metabolites the genomes programme for humans is a wiki which contains unquantifiable information on protein_structure and function biomolecular_interactions metabolic and biosignalling pathways that need to be integrated wikiomics is another wiki for bioinformaticians which contains information on omic concepts and tools ecoliwiki is a social community interested in the escherichia_coli organism wikipathways is a wiki platform created for pathway model curation both wikigenes and gene wiki are wikis for the field of genetics wikigenes contains a set of articles edited to increase the accuracy of the large amount of data produced by sequencing_techniques stored in genbank database gene wiki is a specialized section of wikipedia that focuses on re organizing extending and completing the human gene articles despite the existence of sparqlbin http www sparqlbin com to share sparql queries and the collaborative projects in biological areas there is no biological social community that contributes to the consumption of linked data by sharing biological sparql queries hence we aim to encourage the sharing of users experience trying to take advantage of linked data in the biological domain bioqueries aims to start the process towards a greater understanding of life_sciences linked data_sources by means of online_social we have used social_networks because these have been a key_component in the development of great discoveries in life_sciences bioqueries opens up a way to build up communities around a shared interest in certain biological domains to take advantage of public linked data this is achieved by sharing a virtual space in a wikibased portal for the design and execution of federated and non federated sparql queries that are executed and documented using natural_language descriptions contrary to all the aforementioned biological wikis that use wikipedia software bioqueries is implemented in drupal taking advantages of what this technology offers the main contributions of this work are i a communitybased approach to share sparql queries as a means of sharing the knowledge in life_sciences linked data_repositories ii a set of queries provided as a seed for building the community formed by biological and bioinformatic users and iii a set of software modules to provide a wiki system with sparql evaluation which opens up new possibilities for creating distributed queries to answer more complex queries that can not be answered by a single data source this article is structured as follows section_describes two use cases section_describes the methods applied to implement the system section shows the website navigation the bioqueries content and a system usability scale sus score usability test section_describes the advantages and limitations that bioqueries presents in its current form and finally section summarizes the key_points presented in this article this section is divided_into four sub sections the first sub section_describes the website navigation the second sub section_describes bioqueries content the third sub section shows a system usage analysis and the last section concludes with a system usability assessment in a social space like bioqueries which has a large number of participants in a collaborative space it is important to share different points of views to enrich overall knowledge bioqueries currently has registered users and query entries also we have shown the evolution for year and a month_period before february of the number of registered users against the number of query entries supplementaryshows a registered user increase in the first months of bioqueries because of the publicity given the second increase corresponds to the recent addition of a new federation engine which can be considered as the first federation system integrated in an end_user linked data application in life_sciences information on the top most visited queries is provided by supplementary this table indicates that the kegg mgi and reactome top three queries are the most visited this information derived from users interests could direct bioqueries to solve problems in specific biological areas such as metabolism and genetics however despite that these are the most viewed they are not the most evaluated indicates fraunhofer scai uima hpc and uniprot end_points are the most evaluated followed by kegg end_point these statistics lead us to think that there could be a clear tendency to use registered queries by end_point owners to design new queries to test non published end_points furthermore the sus score obtained from biologist and bioinformatician groups were and respectively supplementary data these sus scores are which means that bioqueries is easy to use for these two groups according to these results we can not ignore the fact that the introduction of sparql queries ab_initio is a hard task for biologists even with the features provided by the system however bioqueries does not limit any biologist who has an interest in and a minimal knowledge of sparql query_language for introducing new queries in this work our main goal has been the construction and dissemination of a tool to create an active community of biologists built around the use of biological linked data the objective of bioqueries is to bring researchers in the life_sciences domain closer to linked data therefore we have developed a social tool to design document and execute in different formats non federated and federated queries in this biological community participants use learn and share opinions and biological_information by using linked data technology this system is freely_available for users to introduce newsharing and executing linked data queries sparql queries and to execute queries and use the services provided by the bioqueries portal the bioqueries community is growing the registration of new queries has improved the usability of the website hence we are considering integrating more features as for future work we propose a query recommender which enables users to select a query from a list of queries according to the user profile and activity
