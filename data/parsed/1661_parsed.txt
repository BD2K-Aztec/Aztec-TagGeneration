evolutionary design principles and functional characteristics based on kingdom specific network_motifs background network_motifs within biological_networks show non random abundances in systems at different scales large directed protein networks at the cellular_level are now well defined in several diverse_species we aimed to compare the nature of significantly observed two and three node network_motifs across three different kingdoms arabidopsis_thaliana for multicellular plants saccharomyces_cerevisiae for unicellular fungi and homo_sapiens for animals results two node feedback is the most significant motif in all three species by considering the sign of each two node feedback interaction we examined the enrichment of the three types of two node feedbacks positivepositive pp negativenegative nn and positivenegative pn we found that pn is enriched in the network of a thaliana nn in the network of s cerevisiae and pp and nn in the network of h sapiens each feedback type has characteristic_features of robustness multistability and homeostasis conclusions we suggest that amplification of particular network_motifs emerges from contrasting dynamical and topological_properties of the motifs reflects the evolutionary design principles selected by the characteristic behavior of each species and provides a signature pointing to their behavior and function systems_biology involves the study of complex interactions between components of a biological system the study of network_motifs within larger_networks can help to unravel the functions of complex biological_networks in biology network motifssubgraphs that recur within a network much more often than expected in random networksinclude negative autoregulation positive autoregulation feedforward loops single input modules dense overlapping regulons and feedback_loops these network_motifs are known to have different dynamical functions and distinct subsets have been found to predominate in various biological_networks such as transcription signal_transduction protein interaction and neuronal_networks or even larger scale ecosystem wide networks most of the previous_studies on network_motifs were however limited to the networks with no interaction sign activation or inhibition although such interaction sign is indispensable for characterizing various dynamical_properties now that networks involving a substantial_proportion of all the signed directed protein networks sdpns within cells are available for organisms from the animal plant and fungal kingdoms we can compare the network_motifs and ask whether there are characteristics which may be kingdom specific and allow us to unravel evolutionary design principles in this article we examine the enrichment of particular network_motifs in the arabidopsis_thaliana multicellular plant saccharomyces_cerevisiae unicellular fungus and homo_sapiens multicellular animal we suggest biological_implications for the sets of network_motifs in each species that arise from their characteristic dynamical and topological_features
