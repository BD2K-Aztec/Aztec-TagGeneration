moderna server an online tool for modeling rna d structures the diverse functional_roles of non coding rna_molecules are determined by their underlying_structure moderna server is an online tool for rna d structure modeling by the comparative_approach based on a template rna_structure and a user_defined target template sequence_alignment it offers an option to search for potential templates given the target_sequence the server also provides tools for analyzing editing and formatting of rna_structure files it facilitates the use of the moderna software and offers new options in comparison to the standalone program availability_and moderna server was implemented using the python language and the django web framework it is freely_available atnon coding rnas have important catalytic and regulatory_functions in organisms from all domains of life the high_costs and numerous obstacles in nucleic_acid structure_determination prompted the development of in silico rna modeling_methods in analogy to similar efforts in the protein_structure modeling field one successful approach is comparative modeling based on the experimental_observation that in evolutionarily_related rnas d structure is typically more conserved than sequence we have recently_developed moderna a standalone tool for rna d structure_prediction based on the comparative modeling_approach here we present a web_server which considerably extends the functionality of our original method
