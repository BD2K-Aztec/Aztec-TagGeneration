genetics_and simrare a program to generate and analyze sequence_based data for association studies of quantitative and qualitative traits motivation currently there is great interest in detecting complex_trait rare_variant associations using next generation sequence_data on a monthly basis new rare_variant methods are published it is difficult to evaluate these methods because there is no standard to generate data and often comparisons are biased in order to fairly compare rare_variant methods it is necessary to generate data using realistic population demographic and phenotypic models result simrare is an interactive program that integrates generation of rare_variant genotype phenotype data and evaluation of association methods using a unified platform variant data are generated for gene regions using forward time simulation that incorporates realistic population demographic and evolutionary_scenarios phenotype data can be obtained for both casecontrol and quantitative_traits simrare has a user_friendly interface that allows for easy entry of genetic and phenotypic parameters novel rare_variant methods implemented in r can also be imported into simrare to evaluate their performance and compare results e g power and type_i with other currently available methods both numerically and graphically currently there is great interest in detecting complex_trait rare_variant associations next_generation e g illumina_hiseq abi and roche solid have made it possible to cost effectively_identify rare_variants through the generation of exome and whole_genome sequence_data it has been demonstrated that for complex_traits testing individual rare_variants is grossly underpowered therefore a large number of rare_variant methods which aggregate variants across a region which is usually a gene have been developed however comparing the power of these methods by reviewing the literature is difficult because there is no regularity in data generation and sometimes to make a particular method appear more powerful than others data are generated in an unrealistic manner although variant data can be obtained for example from the genomes_project and the national_heart lung and blood institute nhlbi exome_sequencing project due to limited samples sizes it is not possible to generate variant data which is reflective of the true distribution of rare_variants e g singletons and doubletons it is therefore crucial to be able to incorporate evolutionary_history to generate large samples of variant data the simrare program was developed to evaluate type i and ii errors of rare_variant complex_trait association methods by generating both variant and phenotype data using realistic models simrare which has a graphical_interface is written in python c and can incorporate r scripts for the evaluation of novel and existing_methods
