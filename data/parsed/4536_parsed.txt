tax fun predicting functional profiles from metagenomic s rrna data motivation the characterization of phylogenetic and functional_diversity is a key element in the analysis of microbial_communities amplicon based sequencing of marker_genes such as s rrna is a powerful_tool for assessing and comparing the structure of microbial_communities at a high phylogenetic resolution because s rrna sequencing is more cost_effective than whole metagenome shotgun_sequencing marker gene analysis is frequently used for broad studies that involve a large number of different samples however in comparison to shotgun sequencing_approaches insights into the functional_capabilities of the community get lost when restricting the analysis to taxonomic_assignment of s rrna data results tax fun is a software_package that predicts the functional_capabilities of microbial_communities based on s rrna datasets we evaluated tax fun on a range of paired metagenome s rrna datasets to assess its performance our results indicate that tax fun provides a good approximation to functional profiles_obtained from metagenomic shotgun sequencing_approaches availability_and tax fun is an open_source r package and applicable to output as obtained from the silvangs web_server or the application of qiime with a silva database extension tax fun is freely_available for download at http tax fun amplicon based sequencing of marker_genes is widely used for large_scale studies that involve many different sampling_sites or time series the common s rrna gene based analysis is a powerful_tool for assessing the phylogenetic distribution of a metagenome but does not provide insights into the communities metabolic potential therefore the prediction of the functional_capabilities of a microbial community_based on marker gene data would be highly_beneficial as a particular difficulty of such a predictive approach for most organisms in marker gene databases the genome and therefore the functional repertoire is not known for instance the silva ssu_rrna database silva full release contains rrna sequences whereas kegg release only comprises complete prokaryotic_genomes in a previous study we introduced a statistical_method for predicting the metabolic_profiles of a metagenome from its taxonomic_composition using a linear combination of precomputed genomic reference profiles a similar method has been proposed for inference of the community_structure from remote_sensing satellite image models in this approach the average ec_number counts of all annotated genomes from a given taxonomic_group e g at order level are used as reference for the linear combination of the community_structure at this v c the author published_by we applied tax fun and picrust to a collection of paired metagenome s rrna datasets that have also been used in the original picrust study see_supplementary section before applying tax fun the silva based s rrna profiles were computed using the qiime tool or the silvangs web_server respectively see_supplementary section and for each paired dataset the spearman_correlation of the whole metagenome and the s rrna predicted relative ko abundance profile was calculated for the computation of the correlation we excluded for each dataset all ko profile dimensions that did not contribute any non zero count in the functional profiles the resulting correlation_coefficients are shown infor the uproc based functional profiles using tax fun the median of the correlation_coefficient varies between soils and guerrero negro hypersaline microbial mat in comparison with picrust the correlation of tax fun is significantly_higher for all four datasets according to a nonparametric sign test p value similar results are obtained using the pauda tool for estimation of the functional profiles see_supplementary section further we compared the coverage of the analysis_pipelines in terms of the fraction of reads that were classified by qiime silvangs and the percentage of otus that were mapped to kegg organisms using tax fun especially for the soil_samples we observed rather low fractions of s rrna sequences that were finally used to predict the functional profiles silvangs tax fun qiime tax fun contrary the coverage for the human_microbiome and mammalian guts datasets is rather high for both qiime silvangs and tax fun silvangs tax fun in our study the soil_samples are probably the most complex communities under investigation further our results revealed that members of the soil communities are poorly represented in the kegg_database however even when applying silvangs tax fun the median of the correlation_coefficients was rather high using merely a fraction of the reads to predict the functional profiles thus a high correlation_coefficient does not necessarily indicate the completeness of the estimated functional repertoire but rather provides a measure of correspondence between the whole metagenome and the s rrna predicted ko abundances therefore the prediction_accuracy is not a function of sample diversity but rather depends on a good correspondence between organisms in genome and s rrna databases even though a sample is very diverse good predictions can be obtained in case that many of the detected organisms or close_relatives are available in both databases in contrast the predicted functional profile of samples with large fractions of unknown organisms can be expected to be incomplete due to the low coverage of database reference profiles thus the coverage of the taxonomic_assignments should always be inspected to check the reliability of the predictions in particular whentax fun predicts the functional profile of a microbial_community just from s rrna sequence_data our approach cannot replace whole metagenome profiling but is useful to supplement s rrna analyses in metagenome pre studies or in situations where shotgun_sequencing is prohibitively_expensive e g for broad surveys in microbial_ecology applications we evaluated our method on four paired data collections from different habitats and compared it to the picrust tool the results indicate a high correlation of the predicted tax fun profiles with the corresponding functional profiles_obtained from whole metagenome sequence_data moreover the results show that tax fun outperforms picrust on all test datasets additionally our results revealed for all datasets a higher correlation between the metagenomic and s predicted functional profiles when using uproc in comparison to the pauda tool see_supplementary section s although we provide functional reference profiles from both tools for tax fun we recommend the usage of tax fun in combination with the uproc based reference profiles for prediction because of the higher sensitivity of uproc tax fun allows easy processing of the output from silvangs qiime or any other analysis_pipeline using the silva database as reference the implementation in r facilitates further statistical_analyses of the tax fun predictions which can be processed within the same r environment
