sparsely correlated hidden_markov with application to genome_wide location studies motivation multiply correlated datasets have become increasingly common in genome_wide location analysis of regulatory_proteins and epigenetic_modifications their correlation can be directly incorporated into a statistical_model to capture underlying biological_interactions but such modeling quickly becomes computationally_intractable results we present sparsely correlated hidden_markov schmm a novel method for performing simultaneous hidden_markov hmm inference for multiple genomic_datasets in schmm a single hmm is assumed for each series but the transition probability in each series depends on not only its own hidden_states but also the hidden_states of other related series for each series schmm uses penalized_regression to select a subset of the other data series and estimate their effects on the odds of each transition in the given series following this hidden_states are inferred using a standard forwardbackward algorithm with the transition_probabilities adjusted by the model at each position which helps retain the order of computation close to fitting independent hmms ihmm hence schmm is a collection of interdependent non homogeneous hmms capable of giving a close approximation to a fully multivariate hmm fit a simulation_study shows that schmm achieves comparable sensitivity to the multivariate hmm fit at a much lower computational_cost the method was demonstrated in the joint analysis of histone_modifications ctcf and rna_polymerase in human cd t cells schmm reported_fewer high_confidence regions than ihmm in this dataset but schmm could recover previously_characterized histone_modifications in relevant genomic_regions better than ihmm in addition the resulting combinatorial patterns from schmm could be better mapped to the states reported by the multivariate hmm method of ernst and kellis availability the schmm package can be freely downloaded from http sourceforge net p schmm and is recommended for use in a linux environment the hidden_markov hmm is an important tool for learning probabilistic_models of sequential data with a local correlation pattern as exemplified in many engineering applications such as speech and handwriting recognition in an hmm it is assumed that the system has a series of unobserved hidden_states following a markov_process the observed data are considered as output from the hidden_states and follow specific distributions in recent_years hmms have been successfully_applied to many problems in computational molecular_biology and statistical genetics in these applications they were used to model spatial_patterns such as genomic_features on the chromosomes similar to temporal_patterns in time series data hmm analysis is already common in genome_wide location studies for example the chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip protocol coupled with microarray chip_chip or next_generation chip_seq is a method of choice for identifying genomic_loci enriched with various histone_modification marks in chip_seq sequence_reads are aligned to the target_genome and data are summarized by counting the aligned_reads in non overlapping contiguous windows e g bp windows because data manifest a clear spatial_correlation an hmm is frequently used to infer the binding status of each window where the hidden state_space consists of binding state and background state with the declining experimental cost it has become increasingly common for genome_wide location analysis to be conducted on multiple regulatory_proteins or epigenetic_marks because many factors interact with each other to carry out biological_processes it is of great interest to understand the correlation among these factors as reflected in the shared binding_sites or modification marks in the context of hmm analysis with two hidden to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions com states in each series one can formulate n separate hmms by assuming independence between every pair of series as illustrated in referred to as ihmm hereafter alternatively one can formulate a single hmm with n hidden_states referred to as fullhmm where n is the number of hidden_states when there are two states in each series they represent two opposite extremes in the sense that ihmm completely ignores the correlation between series whereas fullhmm incorporates the correlation in the multivariate_model for the hidden_states both approaches have advantages and shortcomings ihmm may feature low_statistical but it is computationally_efficient in contrast fullhmm embodies the correlation directly however not all hidden state combinations necessarily appear in the data and it is computationally_expensive if not intractable practically however estimation of an hmm with n hidden_states is computationally_intractable when n is large because n possible transitions need to be followed here we present a novel statistical_model that represents a compromise of these two termed sparsely correlated hmm schmm the schmm approach captures a small subset of non ignorable correlations among data series to avoid modeling all pairwise_correlations this sparsity property is achieved by adopting a regularization regression strategy illustrates our proposed method the dashed_line arrows connecting the hidden_states between series indicate the significant correlations captured by schmm for example the hidden_states at windows t and t in the first series but not the third are used to estimate the transition probability between windows t and t in the second series and vice_versa under this framework there is no need to consider combinations of hidden_states across all series as n tuples as in fullhmm and hidden_states can be inferred considering just four types of transitions in each series separately solid lines the schmm algorithm is able to take advantage of the interactions between correlated series to improve the inference of hidden_states moreover we also reduce the computational_cost by iterating through n series and inferring the hidden state vectors one series a time conditioning on the current hidden state vector estimates of all other series note that the goal of schmm is different from that of the multivariate hmm method developed byfor the analysis of combinatorial patterns of histone_modification using chip_seq schmm aims to infer the hidden_states in the multiple chains simultaneously whereas the multivariate hmm attempts to identify a small subset of representative combinatorial patterns and annotate the genome with respect to such patterns nevertheless the chip enriched windows identified by schmm can be used to facilitate the multivariate hmm analysis potentially improving the quality of genomic annotation
