genome_analysis selenoprofiles profile_based scanning of eukaryotic genome_sequences for selenoprotein genes motivation selenoproteins are a group of proteins that contain selenocysteine sec a rare amino_acid inserted co translationally into the protein chain the sec codon is uga which is normally a stop_codon in selenoproteins uga is recoded to sec in presence of specific features on selenoprotein gene_transcripts due to the dual role of the uga codon selenoprotein prediction and annotation are difficult tasks and even known selenoproteins are often misannotated in genome_databases results we present an homology_based in silico method to scan genomes for members of the known eukaryotic selenoprotein families selenoprofiles the core of the method is a set of manually_curated highly_reliable multiple_sequence of selenoprotein families which are used as queries to scan genomic_sequences results of the scan are processed through a number of steps to produce_highly accurate_predictions of selenoprotein genes with little or no human intervention selenoprofiles is a valuable_tool for bioinformatic characterization of eukaryotic selenoproteomes and can complement genome annotation_pipelines availability_and selenoprofiles is a python built pipeline that internally runs psitblastn exonerate genewise secisearch and a number of custom made scripts and programs the program is available atselenoproteins are a rare class of proteins containing selenocysteine sec an unusual amino_acid which is a cysteine analog with selenium replacing sulfur specific machinery is needed for the recoding of the uga codon usually a stop_codon to sec the main signal for uga recoding is a rna_secondary element called secis from selenocysteine insertion_sequence present in the utr of eukaryotic selenoprotein gene_transcripts to whom correspondence should be addressed selenoprotein homologs not containing sec have been found both as orthologs and paralogs in most of them a cysteine_residue is aligned to sec there are currently known families of selenoproteins in higher_eukaryotes glutathione peroxidases gpx iodothyronine

of these families may contain more than one member in a given genome e g homo_sapiens contains selenoproteins belonging to families all known selenoproteins contain just one sec with a few exceptions selp seln some di isoforms sell in protists selenoproteomes are variable and recently some selenoprotein families limited to protistspecific lineages were identified some lineage_specific selenoprotein families have been identified in algae as well selenoproteins function is wide_ranging and still unknown for many families during the last decade several computational_methods have been developed and used to identify novel selenoproteins see driscoll and chavatte for a review most of these methods rely on the prediction of secis elements a limitation of methods based on predicted secises is that they cannot identify selenoproteins with non canonical secis elements and they can be applied only to the species or taxonomic_groups for which they were developed since bacterial archaeal and eukaryotic secises differ in their structure and also in their localization within the transcript also secis prediction is problematic while there is conservation of the secondary_structure the sequence is poorly conserved thus genomic search for potential secises often lead to a large_number as well as occasionally some false_negatives other strategies not based on secis prediction scan the target nucleotide_sequence searching for orfs with a conserved in frame uga these strategies also produces a large number of selenoprotein candidates in eukaryotic_genomes like those based in secis searches they require substantial manual_curation as a result selenoprotein prediction is usually ignored in the standard genome annotation_pipelines and selenoprotein genes are generally mispredicted either by truncation of end of the gene the uga codon assumed to be selenoprofiles the stop_codon of the coding_region or by truncation of the end the coding_region assumed to start at the first aug downstream of the uga sec codon or by exclusion of the exon or the region containing the uga sec codon as the number of genome_sequences available grows exponentially automatic tools that produce highquality genome_annotations with minimal human intervention are essential here we present a computational_pipeline which we name selenoprofiles capable of producing reliable gene predictions for known eukaryotic selenoprotein families selenoprofiles can be used in conjunction with automatic gene_annotation methods to predict otherwise misannotated selenoprotein genes in eukaryotic_genomes importantly selenoprofiles does not rely on the prediction of secis elements also selenoprofiles does not rely on individual selenoprotein sequences to be used as initial queries but on sequence_profiles characteristic of each eukaryotic selenoprotein family for each eukaryotic selenoprotein family we have thus built an high_quality manually_curated multiple amino_acid sequence_alignment including all known orthologous and paralogous members of the family and we derived a position_specific pssm from it profiles derived from multiple_sequence implemented as pssm markov_models or other structures capture more precisely the intrinsic variation within a protein_family and often lead to searches that are both more sensitive thus allowing for the identification of distant_relatives and more specific easing the identification of spurious hits we show that selenoprofiles can be used with little or no human intervention to accurately identify known selenoproteins in eukaryotic_genomes application of selenoprofiles to the publicly_available reference annotation of metazoan genomes reveals hundreds of misannotated selenoprotein genes
