the swisslipids knowledgebase for lipid biology downloaded from motivation lipids are a large and diverse group of biological_molecules with roles in membrane formation energy_storage and signaling cellular lipidomes may contain tens_of of structures a staggering degree of complexity whose significance is not yet fully understood high_throughput mass_spectrometry based platforms provide a means to study this complexity but the interpretation of lipidomic data and its integration with prior_knowledge of lipid biology suffers from a lack of appropriate tools to manage the data and extract knowledge from it results to facilitate the description and exploration of lipidomic data and its integration with prior_biological we have developed a knowledge resource for lipids and their biology swisslipids swisslipids provides curated knowledge of lipid structures and metabolism which is used to generate an in silico library of feasible lipid structures these are arranged in a hierarchical classification that links mass_spectrometry analytical outputs to all possible lipid structures metabolic_reactions and enzymes swisslipids provides a reference namespace for lipidomic data publication data exploration and hypothesis_generation the current version of swisslipids includes over known and theoretically possible lipid structures over proteins and curated links to published knowledge from over peer_reviewed we are continually updating the swisslipids hierarchy with new lipid categories and new expert curated knowledge availability swisslipids is freely_available www swisslipids org lipids are a large and diverse group of biological_molecules that perform a wide_variety of biological_functions they comprise the bulk of membrane bilayers and energy stores provide markers for the recognition and sorting of distinct organelles and regulate processes such as cell_proliferation and death immunity angiogenesis cardiogenesis and neurogenesis and inflammation the lipid complement or lipidome of individual cells may include hundreds of thousands of lipid structures whose occurrence is tightly_regulated in response to changes in the cellular_environment and lipid availability dysregulation of the lipidome is a feature of many pathological_conditions cardiovascular_disease hypertension diabetes and alzheimer for which lipids may comprise an important source of biomarkers pathogens also manipulate the host lipidome in order to facilitate their own persistence and replication elucidating the roles of lipids in biological_systems requires the integration of quantitative_measurements of lipidome composition with knowledge of lipid metabolic_pathways enzymes and interacting_proteins lipidome composition may be analyzed using mass_spectrometry ms and tandem_mass ms_ms based_approaches which are able to quantify hundreds of lipid_species over a broad dynamic range da silveira dos these approaches provide information on the atomic composition of intact lipids and their component parts such as acyl_chains which can be mapped to prior_knowledge of lipid structures using a standardized hierarchical notation one of the foremost sources of such knowledge is the lipid maps structure database lmsd which provides a comprehensive classification of over lipid structures grouped in major lipid categoriesfatty acyls glycerolipids glycerophospholipids sphingolipids sterol lipids prenol lipids polyketides and saccharolipids other resources and tools for the analysis of lipidomic data include lipidblast which provides a library of lipid structures some derived from lipid maps and associated theoretical tandem_mass lipidhome a database of over million hypothetical glycerolipid and glycerophospholipid structures specifically_designed for ms data_integration and visualization and phospholipid identification valid which provides a search_engine for a library of hypothetical glycerophospholipid structures somewhat similar to those of lipidhome specialized software for annotating ms data include lipidxplorer mzmine and lipid data analyzer a common_feature of all these resources and tools is that they focus mainly on the classification and identification of lipids knowledge of lipid biology including links to metabolic_pathways and enzymes may be found in public_knowledge resources such as brenda hmdb kegg metacyc and reactome although kegg has been used as basis for computational_approaches for matching hypothetical structures to pathways these knowledge resources do not aim to provide comprehensive coverage of the hundreds of thousands of lipids that may exist in nature here we describe the development of a new knowledge resource that is designed to help connect lipidomics and lipid biology swisslipids our aim in creating swisslipids was to provide a comprehensive reference_database that can be used to describe mass_spectrometry based lipid identifications and link them to curated knowledge of lipid structures metabolic_reactions enzymes and interacting_proteins swisslipids was created through an iterative process in which prior_knowledge of lipid structures and metabolism curated from published_literature is used to generate an in silico library of all feasible structures for common lipid categories these structures form the basis for a hierarchical lipid classification that is consistent with currently accepted lipidomic data notation and the classification of lipid maps the result is a reference namespace for lipidomic data publication data exploration and hypothesis_generation allowing users to ask questions such as where has this lipid_species been seen before what structures might this lipid_species have what are the relevant metabolic_reactions and what proteins are known to interact with these putative structures
