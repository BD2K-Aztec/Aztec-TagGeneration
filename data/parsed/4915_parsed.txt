what time is it deep_learning approaches for circadian_rhythms motivation circadian_rhythms date back to the origins of life are found in virtually every species and every cell and play fundamental roles in functions ranging from metabolism to cognition modern high_throughput allow the measurement of concentrations of transcripts metabolites and other species along the circadian cycle creating novel computational challenges and opportunities including the problems of inferring whether a given species oscillate in circadian fashion or not and inferring the time at which a set of measurements was taken results we first curate several large synthetic and biological time series datasets containing labels for both periodic and aperiodic signals we then use deep_learning methods to develop and train bio cycle a system to robustly estimate which signals are periodic in high_throughput circadian experiments producing estimates of amplitudes periods phases as well as several statistical_significance measures using the curated_data bio cycle is compared to other approaches and shown to achieve state of the art performance across multiple metrics we then use deep_learning methods to develop and train bio clock to robustly estimate the time at which a particular single time point transcriptomic experiment was carried in most cases bio clock can reliably_predict time within approximately h using the expression levels of only a small number of core clock_genes bio clock is shown to work reasonably well across tissue_types and often with only small degradation across conditions bio clock is used to annotate most mouse experiments found in the geo database with an inferred time stamp the importance of circadian_rhythms cannot be overstated circadian oscillation have been observed in animals plants fungi and cyanobacteria and date back to the very origins of life on earth indeed some of the most ancient forms of life such as cyanobacteria use photosynthesis as their energy_source and thus are highly circadian almost by definition these oscillations play a fundamental role in coordinating the homeostasis and behavior of biological_systems from the metabolic eckel to the cognitive levels disruption of circadian_rhythms has been directly linked to health_problems ranging from cancer to insulin_resistance to diabetes to obesity and to premature ageing at their most fundamental level these oscillations are molecular in nature whereby the concentrations of specific molecular_species such as transcripts metabolites and proteins oscillate in the cell with a h periodicity modern high_throughput allow largescale measurements of these concentrations along the circadian cycle thus creating new datasets and new computational challenges and opportunities to mine these new datasets here we develop and apply machine_learning to address two questions i which molecular_species are periodic and ii what time or phase is associated with high_throughput transcriptomic measurements made at a single timepoint at the molecular level circadian_rhythms are in part driven by a genetically_encoded highly_conserved core_clock found in nearly every cell based on negative transcription translation feedback_loops whereby transcription_factors drive the expression of their own negative_regulators and involving only a dozen genes in the mammalian core_clock two bhlh transcription_factors clock and bmal heterodimerize and bind to conserved e box sequences in target gene_promoters thus driving the rhythmic expression of mammalian period per per and per and cryptochrome cry and cry genes per and cry proteins form a complex that inhibits subsequent clock bmal mediated gene_expression the master core_clock located in the suprachiasmatic_nucleus scn of the hypothalamus interacts with the peripheral core clocks throughout the body in contrast to the small_size of the core_clock high_throughput transcriptomic dna_microarrays rna_seq or metabolomic mass_spectrometry experiments have revealed that a much larger fraction typically on the order of of all transcripts or metabolites in the cell are oscillating in a circadian manner furthermore the oscillating transcripts and metabolites differ by cell tissue type or condition genetic epigenetic and environmental perturbationssuch as a change in dietcan lead to cellular_reprogramming and profoundly influence which species are oscillating in a given cell or tissue when results are aggregated across tissues and conditions a very large fraction often exceeding and possibly approaching of all transcripts is capable of circadian_oscillations under at least one set of conditions as shown in plants cyanobacteria and algae and mouse in a typical circadian experiment high_throughput omic measurements are taken at multiple timepoints along the circadian cycle under both control and treated conditions thus the first fundamental problem that arises in the analysis of such data is the problem of detecting periodicity in particular circadian periodicity in these time series the problem of detecting periodic patterns in time series is of course not new however in the cases considered here the problem is particularly challenging for several reasons including i the sparsity of the measurements the experiments are costly and thus data may be collected for instance only every h ii the noise in the measurements and the well known biological_variability iii the related issue of small_sample e g n iv the issue of missing_data v the issue of uneven sampling in time and vi the large number of measurements e g transcripts and the associated multiple_hypothesis problem here we develop and apply deep_learning methods for robustly assessing periodicity in high_throughput circadian experiments and systematically compare the deep_learning approach to the previous non machine_learning approaches while this is useful for circadian experiments the vast_majority of all high_throughput expression experiments have been carried and continue to be carried at single timepoints this can be problematic for many applications including applications to precision_medicine precisely because circadian_variations are ignored creating possible confounding_factors this raises the second problem of developing methods that can robustly infer the approximate time at which a single time high_throughput expression measurement was taken such methods could be used to retrospectively infer a time stamp for any expression dataset in particular to improve the annotations of all the datasets contained in large gene_expression repositories such as the gene_expression geo and improve the quality of all the downstream inferences that can be made from this wealth of data there may be other applications of such a method for instance in forensic_sciences to help infer a time of death in any case to address the second problem we also develop and apply deep_learning methods to robustly infer time or phase for single time high_throughput gene_expression in all the tables the best results are shown in bold deep_learning methods can be applied to high_throughput circadian data to address important challenges in circadian biology in particular we have developed bio cycle to detect molecular_species that oscillate in high_throughput circadian experiments and extract the characteristics of these oscillations remarkably bio cycle can be trained with large_quantities of synthetic data preventing any kind of overfitting we have also developed bio clock to infer the time at which a transcriptomic sample was collected from the level of expression of a small number of core clock_genes both methods will be improved as more data becomes available and more generally deep_learning methods are likely to be useful to address several other related circadian problems such as analyzing periodicity in high_throughput circadian proteomic_data or inferring sample time in different species in particular developing methods for annotating the time of all the human gene_expression experiments contained in geo and other similar repositories would be valuable such annotations could be important for improving the interpretation of both old and new data and discovering circadian driven effects that may be important in precision_medicine and other applications for instance to help determine the optimal time for administering certain drugs b deep_learning approaches for circadian_rhythms i
