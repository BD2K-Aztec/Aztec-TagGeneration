systems_biology inferring disease and gene_set associations with rank coherence in networks motivation to validate the candidate_disease identified from high_throughput genomic studies a necessary step is to elucidate the associations between the set of candidate_genes and disease_phenotypes the conventional gene_set often fails to reveal associations between disease_phenotypes and the gene_sets with a short list of poorly annotated_genes because the existing annotations of disease causative_genes are incomplete this article introduces a network based computational approach_called rcnet to discover the associations between gene_sets and disease_phenotypes a learning framework is proposed to maximize the coherence between the predicted phenotypegene set relations and the known disease phenotype gene_associations an efficient algorithm coupling ridge_regression with label propagation and two variants are designed to find the optimal_solution to the objective_functions of the learning framework results we evaluated the rcnet algorithms with leave_one on online_mendelian omim data and an independent test_set of recently_discovered diseasegene associations in the experiments the rcnet algorithms achieved best overall rankings compared with the baselines to further validate the reproducibility of the performance we applied the algorithms to identify the target diseases of novel candidate_disease obtained from recent_studies of genome_wide gwas dna copy_number analysis and gene_expression the algorithms ranked the target disease of the candidate_genes at the top of the rank list in many cases across all the three case studies determination of the molecular cause of diseases is a major focus in genomics research since early s recently powered by the advanced high_throughput numerous large_scale genome_wide disease studies such as genomewide_association dna copy to whom correspondence should be addressed number detections and gene_expression vant were conducted toward this goal typically the objective of a study is to perform a highthroughput scanning for a list of genes that are involved with the disease under study and then a standard follow_up enrichment_analysis or its variants and extensions is applied to analyze the gene_set based on the statistical_significance of the overlap between the genes and gene functional_annotations or associations with disease_phenotypes examples of the well known tools are david gsea gotoolbox and many others however in many cases since the existing annotations of disease causative_genes is far from complete and a gene_set might only contain a short list of poorly annotated_genes enrichment based_approaches often fail to reveal the associations between gene_sets and disease_phenotypes the availability of large phenotypic and molecular_networks provides a new opportunity to study the association between diseases and the gene_sets identified from the high_throughput genomic studies the human disease phenotype network van provides information on phenotype similarities computed by text_mining of the full text and clinical synopsis of the disease_phenotypes in omim large molecular_networks such as the human proteinprotein_interaction or functional linkage network provide functional_relations among genes or proteins based on the observation that genes associated with the same or related_diseases tend to interact with each other in the gene network many networkbased approaches are proposed to utilize the disease modules and gene_modules in the networks to prioritize disease genes a task of ranking genes for studying genetic_diseases in this article we propose a general network based_approach to infer associations between disease_phenotypes and gene_sets utilizing the disease phenotype network and the gene network we formulate the problem as a gene_set query problem by querying the networks with a given gene_set a user expects to retrieve a list of disease_phenotypes with the highest predicted association with the gene_set the principle is that if genes are ranked by their relevance to the query gene_set and disease_phenotypes are ranked by their relevance to the hidden target disease_phenotypes of the query gene_set the known associations between the most relevant_genes and phenotypes tend to be over represented compared with random cases we formulate a simple learning framework maximizing rank illustration of rank coherence in networks a query gene_set of four genes is given in a the four genes are mapped in the gene network and the corresponding nodes are marked with in b the graph laplacian scores are then computed to quantify the relevance between each gene including the query genes and the query gene_set in d if a disease phenotype is selected as the candidate_target phenotype and marked with the graph laplacian scores can also be derived to quantify the relevance between each disease phenotype and the selected phenotype we contrast the case with the target phenotype selected the upper case to the case with an unrelated phenotype selected the bottom case in d to demonstrate the difference in the relevance scores as showed in c the known omim associations are represented as the dashed edges connecting the associated phenotype and gene based on the coherence assumption similarly ranked genes and phenotypes in the two networks should be highly_connected with each other in the upper case and the connectivity will be close to random in the bottom case the edges connecting associated genes and phenotypes are labeled by the discrepancy between their ranking scores clearly the phenotype ranking given by the relevance to the target phenotype is more coherent than the ranking given by the relevance to an unrelated phenotype coherence in networks rcnet with respect to the known disease phenotypegene associations in omim the rcnet algorithms are compared to other methods with leave_one on online_mendelian omim associations and prediction of an independent set of recently_discovered disease gene_associations the rcnet algorithms are then applied to validate findings in datasets from genome_wide gwas dna_copy analysis and microarray gene_expression
