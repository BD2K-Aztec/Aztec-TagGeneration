gene_expression identifying differentially_expressed in two_dimensional electrophoresis experiments inputs from transcriptomics statistical_tools background two_dimensional electrophoresis is a crucial method in proteomics that allows the characterization of proteins function and expression this usually implies the identification of proteins that are differentially_expressed between two contrasting conditions for example healthy versus diseased in human proteomics biomarker_discovery and stressful_conditions versus control in animal_experimentation the statistical_procedures that lead to such identifications are critical steps in the de analysis workflow they include a normaliza tion step and a test and probability correction_for statistical issues caused by the high_dimensionality of the data and large_scale multiple testing have been a more active topic in transcrip tomics than proteomics especially in microarray_analysis we thus propose to adapt innovative statistical_tools developed for microarray_analysis and incorporate them in the de analysis_pipeline results in this article we evaluate the performance of different nor malization procedures different statistical_tests and false_discovery calculation_methods with both real_and we demonstrate that the use of statistical_procedures adapted from microarrays lead to notable increase in power as well as a minimization of false_positive discovery rate more specifically we obtained the best results in terms of reliability and sensibility when using the mod erate t test from smyth in association with classic false_discovery from benjamini and hochberg availability the methods discussed are freely_available in the prot d open_source r package from bioconductor http www bio conductor org under the terms of the gnu general public licensecomparative proteomics_based on d polyacrylamide_gel aims at identifying significant biologically_relevant proteins in most cases protein samples from two conditions are compared e g healthy versus diseased in human proteomics biomarker_discovery or stressful_conditions versus control in animal_experimentation besides the laboratory bench informatics takes a large place in such experiments with digitalization of gels spots detection and matching evaluation of spots volumes and identification of differentially_expressed a large variety of software_designed for the analysis of d digitized images exist both commercial e g delta d from decodon samespot progenesis from nonlinear_dynamics pdquest from bio_rad laboratories and custom researcherdeveloped e g pinnacle from these programs perform three main tasks identification of spots matching of spots from different gels and evaluation of spots volumes each program has its own way to perform these steps therefore software choice has a great impact on the result of the analysis a normalization step is also needed to remove the systemic variation before data analysis an issue with commercial software is the lack of information concerning this critical step as well as the inability to customize the normalization procedure ultimately once spots volumes have been estimated and normalized across gels proteins that are differentially_expressed between groups are identified with software specific methods normalization and identification are also essential steps in de based proteomics_analysis and as compared with other critical steps of the de procedure e g protein extraction staining image_analysis are less studied and under reviewed in the literature on the other hand the same issues have been widely_studied and reviewed for transcriptomic_analysis especially for microarray_studies as pointed_out by some authors the underlying statistical issues are similar between microarrayand de analyses a number of the statistical_tools developed for microarray_analysis have begun to be incorporated in the de toolbox more specifically advances in normalization have been adapted to difference_gel dige analysis statistical_tests developed for microarrays have also been evaluated finally numerous authors highlight the need of correction_for such as false_discovery fdr but few actually evaluate the performance of the different procedures the aim of the present work is to evaluate different methods initially_developed for microarray_analysis to identify differential to whom correspondence should be addressed spots in de experiments to compare these methods real_datasets as well as simulated_data were used we also compare methods for normalization of volumes data before statistical_analysis by evaluating the key_steps of the analysis workflow from normalization to identification of differentially_expressed spots our motivation is to provide a simple and adapted workflow to non statistics expert biochemists all the methods discussed are available as a free open_source r package r core team with highly customizable options the de gel_based experiments are often used in comparative proteomics to identify differentially_expressed or accumulated proteins between two or more conditions the d gels classically allow the visualization of proteins per gel and replication of experiments is needed to minimize the effects of i biological_variations in protein expression between individuals and ii known technical limits such as differential protein extraction strimmer pc storey threshold versus actual fdr for five statistical_tests and four modes of calculation of fdr actual fdrs are calculated as the average of simulations with replicates per condition for comparison purposes a perfect correlation between threshold and actual fdr is represented as a dashed_line bh strimmer pc storey efficiencies comigration of proteins lack of penetration of some proteins in gels or limit of detection of the staining procedure recently different techniques based both on d gel e g dige and gel_free e g itraq techniques have been developed to reduce these technical biases however it seems obvious that whichever technique is used statistical_analysis remains a crucial step in the proteomics workflow to date only a few statistical studies have been dedicated to the specific needs of proteomics and researchers often use the statistical_tools offered in commercial software the statistical possibilities are restricted and researchers have to make decisions based only on a p or q value without knowing the details of the statistical_procedure by contrast with proteomics statistical_tools have been widely developed for transcriptomics applications from a statistician point_of and notwithstanding different forms of data the problem is similar in both applications i e extracting statistically_significant expression from huge datasets in this article we took advantage of many freely_available open_source statistical_tools developed for transcriptomics evaluated their performance to analyze both real and simulated de proteomics datasets and developed an r package adapted to the specific needs of proteomists this r package called prot d is freely_available as part of bioconductor www bioconductor org and includes functions implementing all the methods used in the present article the qt method the fdr calculation method and the moderate t test that were shown in this article to be the best compromises to analyze proteomics_data are preset in the package with the optimal parameters we determined for the fdr calculation mode method from benjamini and hochberg and method from strimmer were shown to be efficient and appropriate for de volume data in all as statistics is one of the most determining step in the comparative proteomics workflow and paradoxically one of the less studied to date we hope that this new package will help improving future de based proteomics_studies
