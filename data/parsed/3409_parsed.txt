genome_analysis pair paired allelic log intensity ratio based normalization method for snp cgh arrays motivation normalization is critical in dna_copy analysis we propose a new method to correctly identify two copy probes from the genome to obtain representative references for normalization in single_nucleotide the method is based on a two state hidden_markov unlike most currently available methods in the literature the proposed method does not need to assume that the percentage of two copy state probes is dominant in the genome as long as there do exist two copy probes results the real_data analysis and simulation_study show that the proposed algorithm is successful in that i it performs as well as the current methods e g cghnormaliter and poplowess for samples with dominant two copy states and outperforms these methods for samples with less dominant two copy states ii it can identify the copy_neutral and iii it is efficient in terms of the computational time used copy_number cnas have been associated with many genomic disorders insertion or deletion of dna_sequences can directly alter the gene_expression levels and thus potentially cause genetic_diseases for example in a st jude study of b progenitor and t lineage acute_lymphoblastic all patients recurring regions of cnas were identified in addition many of these recurring cnas were specific to different subtypes of all associated with prognosis indicating that resistance to therapy in all might be caused by specific genetic changes in another st jude study deletion amplification and other types of cnas were found to be in of b progenitor all cases facilitated by the human_genome the development in comparative_genomic cgh array technology has made it indispensable for cna study among many types of cgh arrays the single_nucleotide cgh snp cgh array is widely used because of its high_resolution and its ability to provide genotype estimates although advances in next_generation are rapidly_changing the landscape of genetics the snp cgh array offers a cost_effective way in cna studies complementary to next_generation in addition the snp cgh array has advantages in voluminous publicly_available data and a wealth of data analysis tools integrative_analysis of genomic_data generated from different platforms requires snp cgh data of high_quality the raw signals from the snp cgh array are inherently noisy because of sampling and or technical variation to reduce such noise the logarithms of signal_intensity ratios between tumor and normal samples from the same individual are usually used for cnas detection a large portion of the sampling_variation may be removed this way because of strong similarities between paired tumor and normal samples in addition tumor normal pairs are expected to be run in the same laboratory and in the same batch to remove experimental variations as much as possible loss_of loh describes the loss of normal function of one allele in a gene and loh detection plays an important role in discovering dna_segments that harbor tumor_suppression genes copy neutral loh cnloh refers to duplication of one of the two alleles and concurrently loss of the other allele so that there is no change in a dna_copy as a result it is difficult to detect cnloh by conventional copy_number measurements on the other hand the methods for accurate cnloh detection often require both tumor and control samples from the same patient many statistical_models and algorithms have been proposed for cgh array based cna analysis normalization is critical for obtaining biologically_meaningful an appropriate normalization method should be able to substantially remove systematic variations while signal changes because of biological alterations are preserved some of the early cgh data normalization_methods directly adopt those developed for microarray_gene such as quantile normalization rank invariant set normalization lowess normalization and so forth a fundamental assumption in these algorithms is to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com that the distributions of the log signal_intensities from all samples are the same however this assumption may not hold in a cna study for example nearly all solid_tumor cancers exhibit whole chromosome gains losses and the proportion of gain loss probes in the tumor genome can vary substantially from sample to sample these translate into substantial differences in distributions of log signal_intensities of different tumor_samples therefore directly applying normalization algorithms developed for gene_expression data might result in over normalization of segments of cnas van to address this problem several methods have been proposed specifically for cgh array normalization for example based on genotype_calls and log_ratio of signal_intensities a reference alignment_method identifies chromosomes in two copy state which are then used as internal references in normalization alignment one problem in this method is that the number of reference chromosomes identified is usually small and thus they might not represent the two copy probes well another method poplowess identifies probes in two copy state using k_means on the segmented mean values and subsequently normalizes the data by lowess regression using probes identified as references the weakness of this approach lies in that only coarse separation can be achieved because of probe pre selection and that k_means requires a pre determined number of clusters the ridge tracing normalization method normalizes cgh data by applying ridgeline regression on the highest ridgeline of a d log intensity_distribution and then using the expectation_maximization to centralize the copy_number ratio this method assumes that the most frequently occurring copy_number probes correspond to the two copy states more recently iterative normalization strategies such as italics for one channel array and cghnormaliter for two channel array have been proposed in both cases segmentation is the key_step and the subsequent normalization depends on the results of segmentation tumorboost was developed to normalize the allele b fraction in tumor whereas total copy_number signals are not normalized in this article we propose a new normalization procedure for snp_array this is motivated by the following reasons i although applying paired_samples in experimental_design could substantially reduce noise in data estimating the true copy_number is often complicated by other experimental and biological_factors such as imperfect dissection of the primary_tumors the existence of the multiple_clones in the tumor_cell ploidy of a sample the spatial signal variation and so forth these factors can reduce the expected signalnoise ratio snr and make it difficult to accurately estimate the true underlying copy_number as a result the conventional segmentation_methods such as circular_binary cbs which works well in partitioning a snp sequence into segments of the same underlying copy_number do not provide estimation of the underlying copy_number for each segment ii almost all current normalization_methods do not take into consideration the existence of cnloh since the mean value of probes in a cnloh segment may be slightly different but not significantly from the mean value of probes in segments with true normal two copy state it is difficult to identify and subsequently remove them from the reference probe set therefore it is necessary to develop new strategies that have strong statistical_power in distinguishing probes in two copy state from those having cnas and simultaneously take into account the existence of cnloh we will briefly present affymetrix snp_arrays in the next section and then describe the proposed algorithm in two parts the first part is to partition probes into the segments of ums uni modal state defined in section or bms bi modal state using a hidden_markov hmm the second part is to apply the cbs segmentation_method on the piecewise average log_ratio palog ratio defined in section to separate probes in two copy state and other even number copy_number states the application of our method on a publicly_available dataset followed by a comparison of our method with two currently available methods is presented in section at the end of the article we discuss the advantages and limitations of our method and possible improvements we demonstrated the performance of pair algorithm by applying it to a public dataset where multiple_myeloma samples were analyzed by affymetrix k array set nsp sty among them samples have matched peripheral_blood performed on the same array types these data were generated inand can be downloaded from the public_domain geo with access id gse correctly identifying reference probes in two copy state from the snp_array is not trivial we propose an algorithm pair that can accurately distinguish two copy state probes from those with cnas the proposed pair algorithm first partitions the whole_genome into segments of ums or bms the normal two copy probes if they exist can then be narrowed down to the segments of ums this algorithm does not assume that two copy probes dominate the whole_genome this is an advantage compared with the methods that require this assumption in contrast to the conventional methods pair has the advantage of being able to identify segments of cnloh this is preferable as the mean log_ratio values of probes in some cnloh segments can be different from those in normal two copy segments and this could cause a bias in the step of centralization should the cnloh segment be large furthermore with the optional allelic normalization we are able to equalize the log intensities of a and b alleles and thus remove one source of false discovery we did not integrate log_ratio and dalog r analyses into the hmm_model but instead we adopted a two step process in part ii we applied cbs segmentation to palog ratios instead of the raw log ratios by doing so we could substantially reduce the computational time meanwhile comparing with the methods using log_ratio the risk of false detection can be reduced if signal drift and uncorrected genomic wave exist we obtained the monotone relationship between log_ratio and dalog ratio and proposed to use dalog ratio instead of baf in cnloh detection and underlying copy_number estimation to avoid_unnecessary data manipulation the proposed method reduced the computation time when comparing with cghnormaliter for the samples with a large number of segments it takes only min to complete the normalization process using our method but usually min using cghnormaliter when the algorithms were run on lenovo t laptop cnas are different from sample to sample and sometimes can be complicated it may be difficult to fully specify all cna forms by a hmm_model bearing this in mind the proposed two state model although it might miss some focal cnas can greatly reduce the risk of misclassification of large segments of cnas this in our opinion is sufficient for a normalization method to be acceptable one of the assumptions of the pair algorithm is that there are at least some normal two copy heterozygous probes in the genome that need not to be dominated the simulation result shows that the pair algorithm has almost power for correctly detecting the normal two copy states when the proportion of two copy state probes are as low as in the extreme cases where virtually no two copy probes exist that is the whole_genome is in the same state we could still determine_whether the whole_genome is in one copy gain loss from two copy it will be more challenging to accurately centralize the probes however this is not the focus of this article
