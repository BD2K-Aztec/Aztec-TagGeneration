genome_analysis gsearch a fast and flexible general search tool for whole_genome background various processes such as annotation and filtering of variants or comparison of variants in different genomes are required in whole_genome or exome analysis_pipelines however processing different databases and searching among millions of genomic_loci is not trivial recent_technological in next_generation have made it possible to sequence whole genomes at unprecedented speeds and low costs one of the crucial goals of whole_genome wgs is to seek a small number of variants related to a phenotype to this end millions of variants are heuristically filtered according to allele_frequencies conservation gene models and predicted impact on protein_function as described in there exist several tools for such analysis additionally selected variants can be analyzed further or visualized for biological or clinical insights even though many annotation and filtering_methods for wgs to whom correspondence should be addressed have been proposed challenges still remain such as processing sequence_variants from many genomes and working with customized reference data current methods require a significant amount of time for processing one genome and are hardly scalable to thousands of genomes additionally many tools adopt their own data_formats and the use of customized annotation data is supported in a limited way we address_these by providing a search tool that enables flexible annotation and filtering of wgs_data from an individual in seconds on normal desktop computers to this end we focus on locus comparison as it is the root functionality of any annotation or filtering tool furthermore locus comparison can be utilized for other tasks e g finding de_novo mutation from a family dataset we developed efficient algorithms for searching variants against a large dataset and implemented multi_threaded versions of them using the c language it should be noted that our tool is not bound to a specific set of annotation databases instead it facilitates the use of custom and public reference files from ucsc ncbi and ensembl by supporting a wide_range of formats for genome_annotation we compared the performance and accuracy of our method with the region based and filter_based functionalities of annovar version march using the dataset of million variants from the known variants kaviar the kaviar files hg and hg were converted to gvf format for gsearch and to the standard input format for annovar each query file hg or hg contained million variants all analyses were performed on a desktop pc equipped with an intel core i processor cores at ghz and gb of ram to compare exact search the hg kaviar variant file was annotated with allele_frequencies from the genomes_project ftp ftp trace ncbi nih gov genomes ftp release that covered over millions of loci gsearch was run in its exact search mode and annovar was run in its filter_based mode gsearch completed the annotation_process in s while annovar took s the annotation results from both tools were the same to compare range search the hg kaviar variant file was annotated with their overlap with million tfbss prepared with the tfbsconssites table from the ucsc table browser annovar was run in its region based mode and gsearch was run in its range search mode it took s for gsearch to annotate the query file whereas annovar took s two methods produced exactly the same result although a majority of previously_published wgs analysis tools include novel data_formats in their pipelines our proposed method can be used with diverse annotation resources in standard genome_annotation file_formats with notable improvements in search speed and flexibility for multiple annotation file_formats gsearch can be used as a stand alone genomic search tool or integrated into existing analysis_pipelines using gsearch users can expeditiously annotate and filter variants in many genomes with various resources on their desktop computers
