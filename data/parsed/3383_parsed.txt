structural_bioinformatics orempro web_server orientation and assessment of atomistic and coarse_grained structures of membrane_proteins the experimental determination of membrane_protein orientation within the lipid bi layer is extremely_challenging such that computational_methods are most often the only solution moreover obtaining all atom d structures of membrane_proteins is also technically_difficult and many of the available data are either experimental low_resolution structures or theoretical_models whose structural quality needs to be evaluated here to address these two crucial problems we propose orempro a web_server capable of both i positioning a helical and b sheet transmem brane domains in the lipid_bilayer and ii assessing their structural quality most importantly orempro uses the sole alpha_carbon coordinates which makes it the only web_server compatible with both high and low structural resolutions finally orempro is also interesting in its ability to process coarse_grained protein models by using coordinates of backbone beads in place of alpha carbons availability_and http www dsimb inserm fr orempro determining the orientation of membrane protein_structures in the lipid_bilayer is necessary to understand their functionwith numerous medical and industrial_applications membrane_proteins are difficult to study due to the laborious and expensive solubilization purification and reconstitution methods they require this is worsened by the need of working on multimeric complexes since membrane_proteins often function as such actually the orientational disorder that exists in the lipid_bilayer makes membrane positioning so difficult that data are available for only proteins which most often makes computational_methods the last resort besides visual_analysis moreover the determination of an all atom structure of membrane_protein is already a challenge and the relevance of positioning side_chains in environments that strongly differ from a biological lipid_bilayer i e detergents and solvents is questionable these difficulties result in an important number of low_resolution structures n ca co backbones and caonly the quality of which needs to be evaluated the same goes for the modelling of membrane protein_structure which is less advanced than for globular_proteins due to the complexity of the lipid_environment therefore making low_resolution and coarse_grained approaches widely used here we present orempro the first web_server aimed at orienting and evaluating membrane protein_structures alpha_and from the sole ca coordinates and thus compatible with both high and low structural resolutions our web_server is also able to process coarse_grained structures such as those used with the martini force_field by using coordinates of backbone beads bb in place of ca v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup comthanks to the use of a minimalistic representation of protein_structures orempro is the first web_server capable of processing lowresolution and coarse_grained models of membrane_proteins thus meeting the need for treating the growing number of these structures our web_server offers a complementary combination of membrane assignment and structural quality_assessment by integrating the innovative anvil membrane positioning algorithm and the maiden statistical potential into a user_friendly interface despite its dual_function orempro is fast and processes most protein_structures within a minute
