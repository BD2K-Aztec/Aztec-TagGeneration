tnt a set of libraries for visualizing trees and track based annotations for the web there is an increasing need for rich and dynamic biological data visualizations in bioinformatic web_applications new standards in web technologies like svg or canvas are now supported by most modern web_browsers allowing the blossoming of powerful visualizations in biological data analysis the exploration of different ways to visualize genomic_data is still challenging due to the lack of flexible tools to develop them here i present a set of libraries aimed at creating powerful tree and track based visualizations for the web its modularity and rich api facilitate the development of many different visualizations ranging from simple species_trees to complex visualizations comprising per node data annotations or even simple genome_browsers availability_and the tnt libraries have been written in javascript licensed under the apache license and hosted at https github com tntvis the web has become the preferred platform to present biological data to the scientific_community several improvements in web technologies are enabling the blossoming of new web_applications for visualising this data first support of well established standards like svg and canvas by all modern web_browsers enables the creation of rich interactive visual displays second the vast improvement in web_browser performance has increased the complexity of visualizations third the proliferation of restful services providing data from reference biological resources permits easy access to biological data directly from the browser the direct availability of this data also facilitates the development of reusable visualizations embeddable directly in web_pages reusability is another key_component in modern web development and a strong trend in current biological visualizations aims to compile reusable widgets for biological data visualization it compiles over components at the time of writing however writing reusable visualizations is a complex task in which the developer has to take into account the scope and the environment of the host application in which the visualization will be embedded representation of tree data_structures has become very popular in different biological fields like phylogenetics or ontology visualization while the representation of track based annotations is central to genome_browsers sequence_alignments or general display of coordinate based features such as protein_sequence domain here a new set of libraries aimed at creating configurable dynamic and interactive re usable visualizations of trees and trackbased annotations is presented they are collectively called tnt standing for trees and tracks and are distributed as independent npm packages for easier integration in web_applications the development of the tnt libraries have been driven by two main design principles flexibility and reusability flexibility is achieved by exposing all its internals in a powerful and carefully_designed api reusability is maximized by developing the libraries as independent units that can be combined tnt is being used by ensembl to display comparative_genomics annotations and the centre for therapeutic target_validation http www targetvalidation org to display both genomic_features and tree based annotation in their websites the tnt libraries have been written in javascript using the d library http d js org as its main dependency it uses svg to render all the visual elements in the browser shows the interdependency graph of the different libraries a short description of each one follows
