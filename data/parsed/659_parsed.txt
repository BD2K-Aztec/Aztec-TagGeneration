genome_analysis bases adjacent to mononucleotide repeats show an increased single_nucleotide frequency in the human_genome mononucleotide repeats mnrs are abundant in eukaryotic_genomes and exhibit a high degree of length variability due to insertion_and however the relationship between these repeats and mutation_rates in surrounding sequences has not been systematically investigated we have analyzed the frequency of single_nucleotide snps at positions close to and within mnrs in the human_genome overall we find a to fold increase in the snp frequency at positions immediately adjacent to the boundaries of mnrs relative to that at more distant bases this relationship exhibits a strong asymmetry between and ends of repeat tracts and is dependent upon the repeat motif length and orientation of surrounding repeats our analysis suggests that the incorporation or exclusion of bases adjacent to the boundary of the repeat through substitutions in which these nucleotides mutate towards or away from the base present within the repeat respectively may be another mechanism by which mnrs expand and contract in the human_genome tandem_repeats of short_sequence are common in the genomes of eukaryotic_species estimated that microsatellites with repeat motifs between and bp account for at least of the human_genome mononucleotide repeats mnrs repeats of a single base are the most abundant class of microsatellites in the human_genome however this class of repeats has been frequently_overlooked in studies of microsatellite evolution and variation one of the most salient characteristics of short_tandem is the high variability in length exhibited by these sequences within populations due to the insertion or deletion of repeat_units most likely reflecting difficulties in replication and repair this variability has led to the widespread use of these sequences as polymorphic_markers for mnrs this type of instability is an important characteristic of some tumors in particular mismatch_repair deficient cancers of the gut and ovary alterations in the rate and spectrum of point_mutations have also been reported in sequences surrounding microsatellites several studies considering small numbers of di and trinucleotide repeats have found evidence of an increase in the mutation_rate near the repeat however there is a lack of consensus regarding this trend with other publications proposing that the frequency of mutations decreases toward microsatellites or remains_stable in this article we have investigated the relationship between mnrs and mutation_rates in the human_genome using data from the dbsnp database we took the number of single_nucleotide snps in the region_surrounding mnrs as a measure of the propensity of a particular site to be affected by mutations we hypothesized that any variation in the frequency of snps is likely to be strongest at positions closest to the repeat as homopolymeric regions are more likely to be subject to errors during replication which could result in the misincorporation of a base at adjacent positions the boundaries of mnrs can also be more easily and clearly defined than those of repeats with longer motifs since sources of ambiguity such as adjacent truncated motifs do not occur therefore by using mnrs we were able to focus in particular on positions immediately adjacent to the repeat in order to discern with greater_accuracy the extent to which any change in mutation_rate is specific to the bases at the boundary between repetitive and unique_sequence
