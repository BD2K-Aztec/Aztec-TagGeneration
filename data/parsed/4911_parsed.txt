sequence_analysis wessim a whole_exome simulator based on in silico exome_capture we propose a targeted re sequencing simulator wessim that generates synthetic exome sequencing_reads from a given sample genome wessim emulates conventional exome_capture technologies including agilents sureselect and nimblegens seqcap to generate dna_fragments from genomic target_regions the target_regions can be either specified by genomic_coordinates or inferred from in silico probe hybridization coupled with existing next_generation simulators wessim generates a realistic artificial exome_sequencing which is essential for developing and evaluating exome targeted variant callers availability source_code and the packaged version of wessim with manuals are available atgeneration of simulated next_generation ngs_reads serves the essential gold_standard in developing and evaluating variant detection_algorithms many tools including wgsim have been developed for artificial ngs read generation recent_studies such as art pirs and gemsim have accomplished more realistic simulation by reproducing known biases coming from sequence_context and empirical platform dependent errors although the current simulators mainly focus on realistic ngs read generation we address another important problem on specifying target_regions whole_exome wes is currently being regarded as a superior option for disease variant finding studies it is cost_effective much smaller in size and easier to interpret results as typical statistics of whole exome_sequencing e g coverage read_distribution and bias are distinct from that of whole_genome sequencing_data variant detection_tools are usually required to calibrate their algorithms for practical use of exome data this naturally demands more realistic simulation of exome_sequencing to promote accuracy of variant_calling tools by providing a statistical base for performance evaluation wessim emulates the exome_capture procedure that forms the basis of major commercial solutions such as agilents sureselect and roche nimblegens seqcap by implementing i dna shearing to generate random fragments ii probe capture by hybridization and iii single or paired_end of the selected fragments other important features including fragment length and gc_content were rigorously considered to reproduce more accurate coverage biases we compared our synthetic data with real wes data to confirm the similarity of major statistics the exome_capture process is highly optimized so that the overall running time is only bounded by the ngs read generation step
