sequence_analysis scorer an algorithm for distinguishing parallel dimeric and trimeric coiled_coil sequences motivation the coiled_coil is a ubiquitous helical protein_structure domain that directs and facilitates proteinprotein_interactions in a wide_variety at the protein_sequence level coiled_coils are quite straightforward and readily recognized via the conspicuous heptad repeats of hydrophobic and polar_residues however structurally they are more complicated existing in a range of oligomer states and topologies here we address the issue of predicting coiled_coil oligomeric_state from protein_sequence the coiled_coil is a protein_structure domain comprising two or more helices wound around each other usually in a lefthanded fashion by using the superfam method to detect coiled_coil containing superfamilies of proteins it has been estimated that on average of open_reading across all genomes contain regions that encode coiled_coils range moreover coiled_coil domains play roles in mediating protein_protein across a wide_array of biological_functions from transcription through membrane_remodeling to cell and tissue structure and stability despite this ubiquity and diversity a relatively straightforward sequence_motif of hydrophobic h and polar p residues hpphppp underlies most coiled_coil structures the positions in these so_called heptad repeats are labeled a through g with the hydrophobic sites falling at the a and d positions traditionally it is these repeats that are identified by coiled_coil region prediction_algorithms vide infra however this apparent simplicity of coiled_coil sequences hides considerable complexity in their d structures coiled_coil assemblies can have different numbers of helices which may be in parallel or antiparallel arrangements and may be formed from the same homo or different hetero helical sequences coiled_coil structure_prediction then can be aimed at one or more of three problems given a protein_sequence can we accurately identify coiledcoil regions given a coiled_coil sequence can we correctly assign its architecture and topology given two or more coiled_coil sequences can we predict how these combine to form functional assemblies here we focus on the second problem and specifically on oligomerstate prediction however the first problem of locating coiled coilpage
