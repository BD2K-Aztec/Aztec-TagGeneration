enhanceratlas a resource for enhancer annotation and analysis in human cell tissue_types motivation multiple high_throughput have recently been developed and allowed the discovery of enhancers on a genome_scale in a single experiment however the datasets generated from these approaches are not fully utilized by the research_community due to technical_challenges such as lack of consensus enhancer annotation and integrative analytic tools results we developed an interactive database enhanceratlas which contains an atlas of enhancers for cell tissue_types a consensus enhancer annotation was obtained for each cell by summation of independent experimental_datasets with the relative_weights derived from a cross_validation approach moreover enhanceratlas provides a set of useful analytic tools that allow users to query and compare enhancers in a particular genomic_region or associated with a gene of interest and assign enhancers and their target_genes from a custom dataset availability_and the database with analytic tools is available at http www enhan ceratlas org enhancers are distal regulatory_dna that regulate transcription_levels of target_genes they play_an in development and diseases unlike promoters enhancers often regulate expression of their target_genes independent of their relative location distance or even the gene orientation furthermore enhancers are often tissue or cell_type due to the relative location and tissue_specificity it is challenging to identify enhancers recently many technologies were developed to map the enhancers on a genome_scale i clusters of transcription_factor tf_binding often represent regulatory_elements and chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip_seq or chip_chip can be used to identify the binding_sites of various tfs or other regulatory_factors ii a few enhancer specific factors have been used to identify enhancers for example ep a histone_acetyltransferase activates_transcription via acetylating the histones therefore the binding_sites of ep were often used to predict enhancers iii it was reported that rna_polymerase rnapii binds to thousands of enhancers therefore binding_sites of polr a the largest subunit of rnapii are considered to be the active regulatory_regions iv dnase_i sites dhs represent the open_chromatin many of which cover the enhancers v formaldehyde assisted isolation of regulatory_elements faire coupled with sequencing is another method to identify large_numbers of active regulatory_elements including enhancers vi some histone_modification patterns reflect different chromatin_states for example the combination of h_k and h k ac is a widely used mark for enhancers vii the dna_sequences of enhancers could also be transcribed and these transcribed enhancer rnas ernas are an indicator of active enhancers viii approaches to determine the threedimensional conformation of chromosomes e g c and chia_pet capture c are able to provide enhancer promoter interactions these above approaches have been demonstrated as powerful_tools to detect enhancers on a genome_wide scale and they have been applied to many cell_types or tissues however the datasets generated by these approaches are not fully utilized by the research_community due to several technical_challenges first these datasets are often disseminated in different databases a centralized data portal is still lacking that is specially_designed for enhancer analysis second enhancer annotations based on different technologies showed large discrepancies a consensus of enhancers will provide more reliable annotation of enhancers third although several genome_annotation databases e g ucsc_genome are currently available to visualize various datasets they do not provide useful tools for enhancer analysis such as comparing enhancers across different cell_types generating network views for enhancertarget interactions and predict enhancers for a custom dataset the goal of our work is of two fold first we combined a large number of available datasets in each cell tissue type to produce a consensus of enhancers that represent the most reliable prediction of enhancers for this purpose we develop an unsupervised_learning approach to evaluate the quality of each dataset in one cell_type and generate a consensus for more reliable enhancer identification using this method we produced enhancer predictions for cell_lines and tissues these enhancer predictions have high_quality compared with single dataset second we constructed a userfriendly interactive online database enhanceratlas org to facilitate the analysis of enhancers for different cell_types a series of analytic tools were developed to extract compare and visualize the enhancers in different cell_types
