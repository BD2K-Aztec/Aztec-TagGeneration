identification of sequence structure rna binding_motifs for selex derived aptamers motivation systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment selex represents a state of the art technology to isolate single_stranded ribo nucleic_acid fragments named aptamers which bind to a molecule or molecules of interest via specific structural regions induced by their sequence_dependent fold this powerful method has applications in designing protein inhibitors molecular_detection systems therapeutic_drugs and antibody replacement among others however full understanding and consequently optimal utilization of the process has lagged behind its wide_application due to the lack of dedicated computational_approaches at the same time the combination of selex with novel sequencing_technologies is beginning to provide the data that will allow the examination of a variety of properties of the selection process results to close this gap we developed aptamotif a computational_method for the identification of sequencestructure motifs in selex derived aptamers to increase the chances of identifying functional_motifs aptamotif uses an ensemble based_approach we validated the method using two published aptamer datasets containing experimentally_determined motifs of increasing complexity we were able to recreate the authors findings to a high degree thus proving the capability of our approach to identify binding_motifs in selex data additionally using our new experimental dataset we illustrate the application of aptamotif to elucidate several properties of the selection process aptamers are synthetic but biologically_active single_stranded ribo nucleic molecules typically ranging between and nt these short_sequences can be designed to bind with high_affinity and specificity a vast spectrum of molecular_targets apatopes spanning from small_organic over macromolecules such as proteins to entire organisms their high structural_stability over a wide_range of ph and temperatures and their diverse functionality the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as the study performed in part when these authors were at department of computational_biology and applied algorithmics max planck institute for informatics campus e saarbrcken germany to whom correspondence should be addressed make aptamers ideal candidates for a broad_spectrum of in vitro assays and in vivo tools applications for aptamers include protein inhibition and purification molecular_detection systems therapeutic_drugs and antibody replacement the latter being of high interest in the pharmaceutical_industry due to substantially lower production_costs shelf lives of years and in many cases higher target_specificity moreover since aptamers are chemically_synthesized they provide a more consistent source of material than antibodies that are secreted by cells aptamers targeting a specific apatope are experimentally_identified through the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment selex protocol the experimental_design of selex is based on the assumption that a large enough pool of candidate_sequences is likely to contain nucleotide strands capable of binding to any target_molecule the traditional selex procedure iterates over five basic steps defining one selection cycle incubation binding partitioning and washing target bound elution and amplification starting with a singlestranded ribo nucleic_acid sequence library of typically random species flanked by primer sites to aid amplification at each cycle a sequence pool is incubated with target_molecules the species in the pool potentially bind the target with specificity depending on their sequence and structure at the end of each cycle low_affinity binders are removed from the solution whereas bound species are eluted and amplified forming the input for the next round eventually only molecules that bind with high_affinity remain however detailed understanding and studies regarding precise aptamerapatope interaction and consequently the evolutionary_processes induced by this interplay lag behind the wide_application of selex products aptamer binding_properties are a function of both sequence and structure however current analyses are predominately focused on sequence until now a common practice was to sequence a sample of aptamers from the last cycle of selex and examine them for possible sequence_motifs using ad_hoc approaches or motif_finding programs such as meme or glam these motifs are then validated in expensive_and wet_lab frequently by introducing a series of point_mutations into the identified sequence_regions with the goal of inducing conformational changes in the structures using adequate binding_affinity assays then allows for the quantification of this mutation with respect to the binding_strength considering the region as functionally_active
