alignment_free local structural search by writhe decomposition motivation rapid methods for protein_structure search enable biological discoveries based on flexibly defined structural_similarity unleashing the power of the ever greater number of solved_protein projection methods show promise for the development of fast structural database_search solutions projection methods map a structure to a point in a high dimensional_space and compare two structures by measuring distance between their projected points these methods offer a tremendous increase in speed over residue_level structural alignment_methods however current projection methods are not practical partly because they are unable to identify local similarities results we propose a new projection based_approach that can rapidly detect global as well as local structural_similarities local structural search is enabled by a topology inspired writhe decomposition protocol that produces a small number of fragments while ensuring that similar structures are cut in a similar manner in benchmark tests we show that our method writher improves accuracy over existing projection methods in terms of recognizing scop domains out of multi_domain while maintaining accuracy comparable with existing projection methods in a standard single domain benchmark test availability the source_code is available at the following website in the era of structural_genomics comparing a large number of structures can be a dauntingly time consuming task therefore a number of databases store precomputed structural_similarities to accelerate structural_comparison queries however such approaches have several limitations first these databases are not always updated in a timely fashion due to the sheer burden of computational requirements even if one applies a program that can compare two structures in s it would take more than year to perform all versus all comparisons of proteins from the non redundant protein set of astral which is only a subset of over solved_protein in the pdb the second drawback of existing structural_similarity databases is that they offer a rigid classification of structural_relationships according to some predefined set of parameters this precludes production of alternate classifications such as building phylogenies for a particular subset of proteins while applying different scoring_functions in addition analysis of a large number of artificial structures such as clustering of models generated by structure_prediction efforts demands ultrafast structure comparison therefore there is an increasingly compelling need for tools that can rapidly compare a large set of structures similarity of protein_structures is typically measured via structural_alignment whose goal is to find a three_dimensional d transformation that brings into correspondence the largest number of atoms between two structures the quality of a d superposition is often measured by the number of matched c atoms and the distances between the matched atoms the exact solution for the pairwise_structural is computationally_expensive therefore heuristic approaches have been developed to find good solutions with remarkable efficiency for a review see even so typical superpositionbased heuristic programs are still too slow for many purposes they take hours to perform a one versus all structural query for example running combinatorical extension ce for one protein_structure against non redundant structures would take about h on a modern desktop computer and thus several cpu months to complete an all versus all comparison a major speed increase for structural_comparison was achieved by considering schemes of reduced representation of protein_structures instead of their full d coordinates of atoms the most popular scheme for reduced structure representation is the secondary_structure element sse and a number of structure matching methods based on sses have been developed since the s since the s ideas from differential geometry and topology have been explored to encode d structures into d representations like a comparison of protein amino_acid a d representation allows much faster structure comparison than a full d alignment more recently several groups developed alternative d methods using innovative shape descriptors such as discrete torsion_angles turning angles between smoothed backbone segments withbefore describing our assessment protocol we discuss a common bias in existing benchmark tests existing benchmark tests typically use representative scop or cath domains however scop or cath domains are not generally typical protein_structures a user may encounter scop or cath domains are normally cut from whole pdb structures by experts of structure classification and automated tools for a new protein to be compared against existing ones delineating its domain boundaries is a non trivial task for its own right therefore we use two benchmark tests for evaluating our method in the first experiment we follow the common benchmark scenario and use single domains from a representative set of scop proteins we use this test to verify that our methods performance is comparable with existing projection methods and also to provide an assessment consistent with those used previously the second experiment adopts a more realistic setting where multi_domain are queried against a scop representative set of single domain protein_structures projection and sse based_methods are aimed to be used as quick filters for more elaborated but slower similarity search_methods a good example is d lookup method used as a filter in dalilite program a filter method should quickly compute a short list e g about of potentially similar structures some protein superfamilies or families may contain a large number of structures therefore returning all similar structures from one superfamily may result in too many matches if the number of total matches is capped some high_scoring and truly similar superfamilies might be excluded from the filter if they are simply less similar than the highest scoring superfamily this problem becomes especially acute when a query is a multi domain protein and we search for all domain representatives therefore we suggest to use a scheme where instead of returning all similar structures only superfamily representatives that received the highest_score are returned in other words a result list of a filter method does not contain two structures from the same superfamily in this way we keep results list short and it covers the largest number of structural superfamilies this scheme was used to evaluate all filter methods below writher is compared against the following projection methods and leading non projection filter programs sgm a projection_method based on gi comparison employing the same procedure used in the basic stage of writher where two segments are compared the gi vectors are generated using the program gi c and the vector comparison is carried_out by an inhouse perl implementation ssef a leading projection_method the sse footprint vectors are computed by a downloadable program and the vector comparison is carried_out by an inhouse perl implementation ssea the filter for vorolign ssea treats a structure as a string of sses and aligns a pair of structures by the standard dynamic_programming on this sse string as the raw alignment score gave unsatisfactory results we normalized it as follows where q and p are query and target_proteins and s raw p q is the raw score from ssea method the algorithm is evaluated using an inhouse c implementation ssea is not a projection_method d lookup algorithm the filter for dalilite the database_search is carried_out by the wolf program in the dalilite package
