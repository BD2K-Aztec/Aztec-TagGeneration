cas analyzer an online tool for assessing ge nome editing results using ngs_data genome_editing with programmable nucleases has been widely_adopted in research and medicine next_generation ngs_platforms are now widely used for measuring the frequencies of mutations induced by crispr_cas and other programmable nucleases here we present an online tool cas analyzer a javascript based implementation for ngs_data analysis because cas analyzer is completely used at a client side web_browser on the fly there is no need to upload very large ngs_datasets to a server a time consuming step in genome_editing analysis currently cas analyzer supports various programmable nucleases including single nucleases and paired nucleases availability free access at http www rgenome net cas analyzer contactprogrammable nucleases such as zinc_finger nucleases zfns transcription_activator talens and rna_guided endonucleases rgens derived from crispr_cas cpf systems which are adaptive_immune in bacteria and archaea are widely used for genome_editing in many research_fields including biology biotechnology agriculture and medical_science the type_ii cas nuclease from streptococcus_pyogenes spcas was the first crispr nuclease used for genome_editing since that time various orthogonal cas nucleases such as stcas nmcas and sacas have been developed recently putative type v cpf nucleases from acidominococcus and lachnospiraceae were reported to mediate efficient genome_editing in human cells and mice moreover dimeric crispr nucleases such as rna_guided nickases and rna_guided foki nucleases or biochemical improvement of wild_type spcas have been developed for genome_editing to reduce off target effects programmable nucleases introduce dna_double dsbs at user_defined target_sites in the genome ultimately inducing targeted gene_knockout or knock in via the cells own repair systems error_prone non_homologous nhej or homology_directed hdr in the presence of a dna_template respectively the induced mutation_rates in cells can be estimated in a straightforward manner by using surveyor nuclease the t endonuclease i t e assay polyacrylamide_gel page or droplet digital pcr however these methods do not allow analysis of mutant sequences and are limited by relatively poor_sensitivity recently we and other groups have used targeted deep_sequencing to detect programmable nucleaseinduced mutations with high_sensitivity and precision and to analyze mutation_patterns however analysis of next_generation ngs_data is difficult for many researchers although a few web_based tools such as crispr ga ageseq and crispresso are available they are inconvenient to use because their web interfaces require a very long time to upload large associate editor prof alfonso valencia the author s published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons http creativecommons org_licenses which permits non commercial re use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com data_files supplementary note ageseq and crispresso also support a command_line but they are not accessible to researchers who are not familiar with bioinformatics to address_this we present a web_based cas analyzer that is constructed with a javascript based algorithm thus it wholly runs on the client side so that large_amounts of sequencing_data do not need to be uploaded to the server thanks to the improvements in the newest javascript engines in the most recent web_browsers supplementary this tool works in a reasonable time currently cas analyzer supports a variety of nucleases including single nucleases spcas stcas nmcas sacas cjcas and ascpf lbcpf and paired nucleases zfns talens cas nickases and dcas foki nucleases
