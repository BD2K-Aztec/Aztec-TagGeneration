structural_bioinformatics relax the analysis of biomolecular kinetics and thermodynamics using nmr relaxation_dispersion data nuclear_magnetic nmr is a powerful_tool for observing the motion of biomolecules at the atomic_level one technique the analysis of relaxation_dispersion phenomenon is highly suited for studying the kinetics and thermodynamics of biological_processes built on top of the relax computational environment for nmr dynamics is a new dispersion analysis designed to be comprehensive accurate and easy to use the software supports more models both numeric and analytic than current solutions an automated protocol available for scripting and driving the graphical_user gui is designed to simplify the analysis of dispersion data for nmr spectroscopists decreases in optimization time are granted by parallelization for running on computer clusters and by skipping an initial grid_search by using parameters from one solution as the starting_point for another using analytic model results for the numeric models taking_advantage of model nesting and using averaged non clustered results for the clustered analysis availability_and the software relax is written in python with c modules and is released under the gplv_license source_code and precompiled binaries for all major operating_systems are available from http www nmr
