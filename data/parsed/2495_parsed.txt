genome_analysis integirty a method to identify genes altered in cancer by accounting for multiple mechanisms of regulation using item_response motivation identifying genes altered in cancer plays_a in both understanding the mechanism of carcinogenesis and developing novel therapeutics it is known that there are various mechanisms of regulation that can lead to gene dysfunction including copy_number change methylation abnormal expression mutation and so on nowadays all these types of alterations can be simultaneously interrogated by different types of assays although many methods have been proposed to identify altered genes from a single assay there is no method that can deal with multiple assays accounting for different alteration types systematically results in this article we propose a novel method integration using item_response integirty to identify altered genes by using item_response that allows integrated analysis of multiple high_throughput assays when applied to a single assay the proposed method is more robust and reliable than conventional methods such as students t test or the wilcoxon_rank when used to integrate_multiple assays integirty can identify novel altered genes that cannot be found by looking at individual assay separately we applied integirty to three public cancer datasets ovarian_carcinoma breast_cancer glioblastoma for cross assay type integration which all show encouraging_results availability_and the r package integirty is available at the web_site bioinformatics mdanderson org main oompa overview cancer_progression involves successive genetic and epigenetic_alterations that transform normal cells into malignant derivatives by acquiring the eight hallmarks of cancer sustaining proliferative signaling evading growth suppressors resisting cell_death enabling replicative immortality inducing angiogenesis activating invasion and metastasis reprogramming energy_metabolism and evading immune destruction as a result it is of great interest to identify altered genes as potential_therapeutic in the past this would have been a daunting task considering that the human_genome contains more than genes using rapidly_evolving high_throughput researchers can now profile the whole_genome with multiple assay modalities in a time and cost effective_manner the cancer_genome tcga is one current initiative that exploits these technological_advances for the same set of samples tcga applies a variety of technologies including gene_expression microarray microrna array methylation array array_cgh snp_array and sequencing to interrogate the genomes of several types of cancer tcga and similar datasets pose a great challenge and opportunity for integrative bioinformatics_research over the last decade several methodologies have been proposed for integrating genome_wide expression and copy_number cn data these methods can be roughly grouped into four categories stepwise regression_based correlationbased and latent_variable many existing_methods focus on the correlation between assays and or outcome for example developed a stepwise method called sodegir to identify overlapping genomic_regions of differential_expression and genomic imbalance used linear_mixed to search for genes whose expression is affected by cn change peng et_al proposed penalized multiple_regression to model the dependence of rna expression on dna cn there are also methods based on canonical_correlation that aim to find associations between cn and expression or even with outcome comparison of existing two way integration methods is available the cnamet method developed by takes methylation data into account and is able to integrate three types of assays our proposed method integration using item_response integirty is a latent_variable approach with a different goal integirty aims to use multiple assays to identify genes that are altered in cancer samples compared to normal_controls this general task is similar to differential_expression in a tumor normal comparison for which good reviews are available conventional methods for differential_expression only deal with one to whom correspondence should be addressed type of data integirty extends the analysis to multiple assay types and defines an overall metric for gene alteration integirty automatically adjusts for heterogeneity in the data and in principle can be applied simultaneously to any number of whole_genome assays the integirty model is motivated by the biological observation that tumor_suppressor can be blocked or oncogenes can be activated by different mechanisms in different patients one patient may have a deletion of the chromosomal_region containing a gene another may exhibit hypermethylation a third may have a mutation that hampers transcription or translation or leads to a loss of function each kind of alteration could be sufficiently rare that the importance of the gene might be overlooked in analyses that study only one kind of assay mechanism driven analytical_methods for data_integration such as those that prioritize genes with evidence that cn alterations lead directly to mrna_expression changes could still overlook genes that are sometimes deleted and sometimes hypermethylated we address this situation statistically using a binary latent_variable that serves as an indicator of whether a gene is important for an individual patients cancer conditional on this latent_variable we assume that changes in different assay platforms cn mutation methylation etc are statistically independent changes in mrna_expression may still occur independently of these assays if for example they result from failures of regulation by mirs or transcription_factors thus the goal of our method differs from existing_methods we want to identify genes that are frequently altered in cancer regardless of the kind of alteration we base integirty on irt which is widely used to construct score evaluate and compare psychological and educational tests a test consists of a set of items or questions designed to measure a certain ability unlike earlier test theories irt models a persons response to a test at the item level rather than the test level therefore irt can simultaneously model two entities i the examinees latent_trait or ability that determines his or her performance on the test and ii the characteristics of each item represented by its difficulty and discrimination this ability to simultaneously model examinees and test items makes irt ideal for modeling complex and heterogeneous genomic_data where different genes and samples from various assays behave differently to transform the irt terminology to our application we treat genes as examinees and samples as items in this way we can unleash the power of irt to address many difficulties in integrative_analysis i the heterogeneity between assays can be resolved by the auto adjustable item parameters making the estimation of an overall latent_trait of alteration possible and meaningful ii integration across assays can be easily achieved by assembling a larger test with different assays supplying the items iii the estimated latent_trait of gene alteration as well as the item difficulty parameters are intuitive and can be used for further inference we have applied this method to three public datasets two tcga datasets ovarian_carcinoma ov the cancer_genome research network and glioblastoma gbm and one breast_cancer brca dataset all three datasets contain multiple high_throughput assays interrogating the same set of samples we estimated the latent_trait of alteration for each gene from each individual assay and after combining assays we show that after integrating_multiple assays novel genes can be identified the new method was also compared to conventional methods such as students t test and wilcoxon_rank and to the cnamet approach for integrating different assays to assess_statistical which is not provided by ordinary irt applications we used a permutation_test to compute empirical p values we performed a simulation_study to show that the model can recover both the item parameters and latent traits in an integration setting see section in supplementary_material we then investigated three public datasets details about the samples and preprocessing_steps are provided in section in supplementary_material both the ov and gbm datasets contain three types of assays interrogating expression expr methylation methy and cn the brca dataset only contains data for expression and cn all three datasets have been examined in detail however due to page limitations we mainly focus on ov data and present other datasets when necessary the pl pl and pl models have been fitted on each dataset based on bic the pl model is shown to be the preferred model in all datasets supplementary hence all results presented below are from pl model as the cost of high_throughput technology drops dramatically it becomes common to interrogate samples with multiple_modalities of assays simultaneously however systematically integrating these assays is rarely achieved by existing_methods here we propose a natural and interpretable framework to integrate heterogeneous high_throughput datasets using irt this is the first application of irt to integrative bioinformatics_research in our approach both samples and genes are simultaneously modeled through the item response model the heterogeneity among different datasets is automatically adjusted by fitting different item parameters the integrated latent_trait provides a nice metric to define the overall propensity to alteration in all assays importantly the integrated latent_trait can be used to identify novel genes that cannot be identified by looking at each dataset individually furthermore the estimated latent_trait together with item parameters characterizing the properties of genes and patient samples can be used as an intuitive visual aid to examine the high_dimensional dataset compared to conventional methods our method is able to identify altered genes that are more reliable and likely to be biologically_meaningful with increased sample_size the conventional method has increased power to detect a difference between tumor and normal samples however in many cases such differences are dubious and irrelevant to the underlying biology in comparison genes identified by our method ensure a biological difference the reason is that latent traits are computed from the dichotomized data with the biology alteration status already built in another advantage of our method is that it does not make any distributional assumption about the data this enables us to identify genes that are missed by conventional methods such as the t test it should be pointed_out that our method mainly focused on the alteration status rather than the correlations between different assays as a result the direction of regulation is not modeled for instance identified alteration in expression can be either overexpression or underexpression nevertheless when a gene is overexpressed in one group of patients while underexpressed in another group our method has the advantage to still identify such genes even when the mean expression is unaffected in this respect it is similar to the ppst test introduced to find markers in mrna_expression data we have chosen to dichotomize all of the assays as part of our approach to integration this approach simplifies the integration step because all of the data inputs are binary while the logistic_model in equation requires binary_data the heart of our approach lies in the latent_variable that indicates alteration and appears as a probability on the left_hand side of the equation irt has been generalized to other kinds of data by changing the right hand side of equation for ordinal data with more than two categories which might arise from categorizing cn data as loss normal or gain one can use the generalized partial credit model the rating_scale model or the graded_response model for continuous bounded data like that from a methylation array one can use beta distributions for normally distributed data such as log_transformed mrna_expression data the natural generalization of the irt model is equivalent to factor_analysis fa fa has been used previously to integrate expression data profiled by different microarray_platforms for individual assays it is likely that one of these alternative_models that preserve more of the continuous input_data would prove more effective than the logistic_model that we present however using different models on each data type presents other difficulties in order to integrate the data from multiple assays it becomes necessary to specify the joint distributions which could result in an elaborate and unwieldy model integirty resolves this issue by coding all of the data from all assays into binary we believe that this simplification of the model provides further benefits by making the results more d expression is turned off in both tumor and normal samples due to hypermethylation since there is little difference between tumor and normal both methods suggest it is not altered interpretable but only further research will determine if more complex models can produce better results
