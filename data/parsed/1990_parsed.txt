gene slider sequence_logo interactive data visualization for education and research gene slider helps visualize the conservation and entro py of orthologous dna and protein_sequences by presenting them as one long sequence_logo that can be zoomed in and out of from an overview of the entire_sequence down to just a few residues at a time a search function enables users to find motifs such as cis_elements in promoter_regions by simply drawing a sequence_logo representation of the desired motif as a query in addition to displaying user supplied fasta files our demonstration version of gene slider loads and displays a rich database of conserved non coding_regions across the brassicaceae indexed to the tair col arabidopsis_thaliana sequence it also displays transcription_factor enabling easy identification of regions that are both conserved across multiple species and may contain transcription_factor sequence_logos are a well known bioinformatic data visualization paradigm for displaying conservation and entropy in aligned sequences each of the residues in a sequence is represented by a series of stacked characters in which the height of the stack signifies the degree of conservation for that position and the height of the characters signifies the frequency of that residue traditionally sequence_logos are generated with tools such as weblogo and seq logo in which any sequence beyond or so bases must be broken into separate rows this makes_it to identify motifs that span_multiple rows skylign addresses this problem by generating long sequence_logos that can to whom correspondence should be addressed be zoomed in and out of however it is still difficult to identify amino_acid when there is wobble in one or more of the bases gene slider addresses these challenges by combining the ability to make long sequence_logos with a search panel that automatically highlights motifs of interest even when there is a high degree of wobble slider controls assign certainty thresholds for each position of a search query to control whether the search function will recognize partially conserved matches up to six different motifs can be searched for with each motif containing up to eight different bases a navigation slider at the bottom of the screen indicates which region of the sequence is currently being displayed coloured markers along this slider indicate where query motifs have been identified making it easy to see where multiple matches have been found shows a portion of an alignment in which there is only one occurrence of the motif aaaca without the search function it would be challenging to find this motif because of the entropy in positions and of the match phenss application of the shannon entropy formula individual bit scores are summed to make a total bit score for the column symbols are then scaled according to the frequency of residues found in each column and drawn to the screen according to the start and end_points of the view settings the usual shannon logo can be misleading because column heights do not take insertion_and into account a base that is only found in one sequence while each of the other sequences show a gap will have the same bit score and column height as a base that is conserved across every sequence gene slider provides two modes for visualizing how many sequences are contributing to the bit score for any given base the first mode uses a horizontal bar indicator as can be seen inwhere positions only have one species with a base in that column the second mode manipulates the saturation_level of each column which takes_advantage of the preattentive ability in our visual_cortex to quickly recognize subtle changes in luminance motifs in the promoter of kat at g it has been shown that the transcription_factor soc affects stomatal opening which is regulated by kat the left panel shows a well conserved soc binding_site yellow immediately_upstream of the kat promoter while the right panel shows a soc site that is not well conserved the hypothesis would be that the former is the functional soc binding_site the panels are displayed with the same vertical weighted bit score scale gene slider provides another method for overcoming this problem by introducing a new logotype we call a weighted shannon this approach factors the number of sequences contributing to the bit score into the calculation of that positions height by multiplying the bit score with the number of residues in that column divided by the total number of sequences in the alignment in contrast to the various kullback_leibler modifications in seq logo this produces a logotype that is similar to the convention but highly conserved_regions are not conflated with ones having just one or two residues in an otherwise gapped region work sessions can be saved and reloaded via a dynamically generated url accessed through the share button the screen grab button creates high_resolution images suitable for publication gene slider can display dna or protein fasta files as well as gff files that are uploaded by the user gene slider was written in processing js and runs in most web_browsers it can display a large number of sequences of any length however performance decreases as the sequence_length and sequence number goes up contemporary laptops can display sequences up to bases long without noticeable lag data can be loaded directly from the users hard drive however conserved noncoding sequence_data can be loaded from restful web_services running on the bar
