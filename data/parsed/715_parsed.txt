structural_bioinformatics betaware a machine learning_tool to detect and predict transmembrane beta_barrel proteins in prokaryotes the annotation of membrane_proteins in proteomes is an important problem of computational_biology especially after the development of high_throughput techniques that allow fast and efficient genome_sequencing among membrane_proteins transmembrane barrels tmbbs are poorly represented in the database of protein_structures pdb and difficult to identify with experimental_approaches they are however extremely_important playing key roles in several cell functions and bacterial pathogenicity tmbbs are included in the lipid_bilayer with a barrel structure and are presently found in the outer_membranes of gram_negative mitochondria and chloroplasts recently we developed two top performing methods based on machine_learning to tackle both the detection of tmbbs in sets of proteins and the prediction of their topology here we present our betaware program that includes both approaches and can run as a standalone program on a linux basedtransmembrane barrel proteins tmbbs are important proteins that cross the lipid_bilayer with a series of strands arranged in a cylindrical geometry and forming a structure that resembles a barrel although all living_organisms have transmembrane_proteins organized into all helical bundles tmbbs are presently found in the outer_membranes of gram_negative mitochondria and chloroplasts despite their relevance few tmbb structures are available at atomic_resolution from gram_negative about of all the structures from gram_negative in the protein database pdb several computational_methods have been developed to predict tmbbs from protein_sequences two prediction_problems can be addressed i tmbb detection in genomes and ii the prediction of protein topology here we present betaware a tool based on machinelearning approaches to detect tmbbs in large sets of proteins and predict their topology betaware is available under gpl license as a standalone program which is particularly well suited for large_scale genome analyses for the prediction of tmbb topology it has been shown on comparative_analyses that approaches based on grammatical modelling are the best performing while for the detection of tmmbs in a set of proteins the best performing method is based on n to extreme learning machines elm in this application notes we present betaware a standalone program that can detect with high_reliability tmbbs in large sets of proteins and that furnishes a state of the art performance in the task of the prediction of tmbb topology the program can be installed on a linux based machine and can be used in house for wide screening applications for the indices see_supplementary
