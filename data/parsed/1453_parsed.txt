sequence_analysis dnaapp a mobile application for sequencing_data analysis there have been numerous applications developed for decoding and visualization of ab dna_sequencing files for windows and mac platforms yet none exists for the increasingly popular smartphone operating_systems the ability to decode sequen_cing files cannot easily be carried_out using browser accessed web_tools to overcome this hurdle we have developed a new native app called dnaapp that can decode and display ab sequencing file on android and ios in addition to in built analysis tools such as reverse complementation protein_translation and searching for specific sequences we have incorporated convenient functions that would facilitate the harnessing of online web_tools for a full range of analysis given the high usage of android ios tablets and smartphones such bioinformatics apps would raise productivity and facilitate the high_demand for analyzing sequencing_data in biomedical_research restriction_sites and tags seefor the android graphical_user gui of to aid users in further analysis dnaapp is capable of generating all six possible translations of a dna_sequence to proteins the copy and search functions are applicable for protein_sequences should the user require storing the sequence_data as a human_readable text_based document the dnaapp allows the export of fasta_format files because the analyzed sequence would be too long to fit within the device screen in a single_line we incorporated the use of fast and end scrolling icons for different speed scrolling for longer_reads the app also adapts by autorotation to landscape orientation in the development of dnaapp the biggest challenge was the decoding of the sequencing ab file using the abif applied biosystem inc format the elements of data stored in the ab file include the trace data of the four signal channels corresponding to dna bases adenine a guanine g thymine t and cytosine c the array of peak locations the dna_sequence inferred by the base caller of the sequencing system and the quality_score array dnaapp acquires each data item by looking up the desired entry in the file directory figures out the starting offset data size of each data element and number of elements the data item has and finally performs the reading chromatograms are shown by plotting the arrays of trace data of the four channels a g t and c using spline interpolation to generate the reverse complement chromatogram inference was done by trace b i trace b l i in which b fa g t cg where b is the complement base of b l is the sequence_length i l this feature assesses the confidence of reverse complement bases for the segment searching feature we used the knuth morrispratt algorithm dnaapp is created for on the go visualization and quick analysis of ab files on mobile computing platforms it has been built to facilitate integration with online web_tools accessible through mobile browsers for in depth analysis if needed examples of such analyses that can be performed are available in the app download pages and user guide the android version of the application is available in google play store for android version onward and is compatible with both smart phones and tablet pcs at configurations as low as ghz cpu and mb ram the ios version is available in app store for ios and above
