snoopy a unifying petri_net framework to investigate biomolecular networks to investigate biomolecular networks snoopy provides a unifying petri_net framework comprising a family of related petri_net classes models can be hierarchically_structured allowing for the mastering of larger_networks to move easily between the qualitative stochastic and continuous modelling paradigms models can be converted into each other we get models sharing structure but specialized by their kinetic_information the analysis and iterative reverse_engineering of biomolecular networks is supported by the simultaneous use of several petri_net classes while the graphical_user adapts dynamically to the active one built in animation and simulation are complemented by exports to various analysis tools snoopy facilitates the addition of new petri_net classes thanks to its generic design availability our tool with petri_net samples is available free of charge for non commercial use at http www dssz informatik tu cottbus de snoopy html supported operating_systems mac os x windows and linux selected distributions petri_nets combine an intuitive bipartite graphical_representation with formal semantics allowing for model execution to experience the net behaviour as well as exhaustive analyses to prove certain net properties the rich body of petri_net theory comprises structural and dynamic analysis techniques coming up with conclusions on behavioural properties under any timing constraints petri_nets enjoy an explicit notion of concurrency they provide a flexible modelling language and allow the unambiguous representation of mass flow and biochemical or genetic_regulation mechanisms at arbitrary abstraction level within one model ranging from molecular via cellular to multi cellular_level describing for example developmental_processes in multi_cellular pattern formation most importantly petri_nets may serve as umbrella formalism integrating qualitative_and i e stochastic continuous or hybrid modelling and analysis techniques supported by quite a number of reliable tools developed by the international community of computational_methods accordingly snoopy is set up as unifying to whom correspondence should be addressed petri_net framework comprising a family of related petri_net models sharing structure but specialized by their kinetic_information qualitative time free place transition petri_nets qpn as well as quantitative time dependent petri_nets such as stochastic petri_nets spn and continuous petri_nets cpn this provides the grounds to investigate one and the same model in various complementary ways to move easily between the qualitative stochastic and continuous paradigms models can be converted into each other obviously with loss of information in some directions cf arrows labelled with abstraction in different net classes can be used simultaneously
