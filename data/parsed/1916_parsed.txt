genome_analysis fx an rna_seq analysis tool on the cloud fx is an rna_seq analysis tool which runs in parallel on cloud_computing infrastructure for the estimation of gene_expression levels and genomic variant_calling in the mapping of short rna_seq fx uses a transcriptome based reference primarily generated from mrna_sequences from refseq ucsc and ensembl databases this approach reduces the misalignment of reads originating from splicing junctions unmapped reads not aligned on known transcripts are then mapped on the human_genome reference fx allows analysis of rna_seq on cloud_computing infrastructures supporting access through a_user availability fx is freely_available on the web at http fx gmi ac kr and can be installed on local hadoop clusters guidance for the installation and operation of fx can be found under the documentation menu on the website accurately quantifying gene_expression levels and identifying variants in the transcriptome is important for research into cell_differentiation and disease diagnosis recently various genome research groups have developed genome and transcriptome_analysis software based on cloud_computing technology to facilitate the analysis of large_amounts of sequencing_data without the purchase of computing_resources bioinformatics cloud resources using the hadoop map reduce framework have been released such as cloudaligner cloudburst crossbow and myrna to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first three authors should be regarded_as supplementary however operation of cloudbased analytic tools can be difficult for non expert users such as biologists and medical_doctors in our previous study we found a problem inherent to rna_seq analysis tools that align to the human_reference reads coming from spliced junctions of large introns cannot be aligned due to indel insertion and deletion sensitivity of alignment tools to resolve this problem recent_studies have analyzed gene_expression and alternative_splicing by aligning short rna_seq against previously known or predicted transcripts following this approach we enhanced the mapping of short_reads by aligning toward a reference composed of known genes and their isoforms to identify unannotated transcripts fx aligns the remaining unmapped reads onto human_genome reference when short_reads align to multiple cdna_sequences from the three databases only the hit with the highest mapping score is used supplementary this method allowed us to profile gene_expression and call variants with great accuracy in this work we implemented these methods in the user_friendly gene_expression analytic tool fx allowing rna_seq to begin immediately upon completion of sequencing fx can be run by researchers without investment in their own high_performance hpc at low_cost using the amazon_web aws http aws amazon com the results output by fx are gene_expression snp calls and short indels supplementary_material this service can be accessed through our web_interface alternatively fx is freely_available for local distribution we developed fx as described in section to run on local hadoop systems as well as the amazon cloud system fx was implemented using jdk designed to run on clustered computers using the hadoop distributed file system hdfs built by apache hadoop http hadoop apache org a_user was designed allowing researchers to adjust the bioinformatic filter conditions as desired we analyzed the transcriptome_data of a korean individual designated ak using fx sequencing page
