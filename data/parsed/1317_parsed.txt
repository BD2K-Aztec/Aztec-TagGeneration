genome_analysis de_novo detection of copy_number by co assembly motivation comparing genomes of individual_organisms using next_generation data is until now mostly performed using a reference_genome this is challenging when the reference is distant and introduces bias towards the exact sequence present in the reference recent improvements in both sequencing read_length and efficiency of assembly algorithms have brought direct comparison of individual_genomes by de_novo rather than through a reference_genome within reach results here we develop and test an algorithm named magnolya that uses a poisson_mixture for copy_number estimation of contigs assembled from sequencing_data we combine this with co assembly to allow de_novo detection of copy_number cnv between two individual_genomes without mapping reads to a reference_genome in co assembly multiple sequencing samples are combined generating a single contig graph with different traversal counts for the nodes and edges between the samples in the resulting coloured graph the contigs have integer copy_numbers this negates the need to segment genomic_regions based on depth of coverage as required for mapping based detection methods magnolya is then used to assign integer copy_numbers to contigs after which cnv probabilities are easily inferred the copy_number estimator and cnv detector perform well on simulated_data application of the algorithms to hybrid yeast genomes showed allotriploid content from different origin in the wine yeast y and extensive cnv in aneuploid brewing yeast genomes integer cnv was also accurately_detected in a short_term laboratory evolved yeast strain genomes can differ in many ways several types of variation are commonly distinguished from small local differences such as single_nucleotide and short insertions_and indels to variation involving dna_fragments kbp i e structural_variation structural_variations can be divided_into balanced and unbalanced mutations balanced mutations such as inversions and translocations preserve the copy_number of a given allele whereas unbalanced mutations such as indels and duplications change the number of copies of the involved allele differences between genomes in the latter respect are referred to as copy_number cnv algorithms for variant discovery have until recently started by mapping sequencing_reads to a reference_genome subsequently variation between the sequenced_genome and the reference is inferred by analysing aberrantly mapped_reads read_depth variation split_read mappings or a combination of aberrantly mapped read_pairs and read_depth variation optionally reads from the target sample in regions with many aberrantly mapped_reads can then be locally assembled to infer genomic_sequence not present in the reference_genome recently the cortex assembler was introduced the first fully de_novo variant detection algorithm not reliant on a reference_genome cortex is a de_bruijn assembler capable of co assembling multiple sequencing samples in the underlying data_structure the de_bruijn the nodes and edges are coloured by the samples in which they are observed by observing bifurcations in the graph that separate the colours bubbles sequence_variation is detected while bubble finding works well for detecting simple variation it does not easily allow cnv_detection a duplication event introduces an almost identical sequence in the genome i e a repeat furthermore larger cnv regions are likely to contain repetitive_regions inherent to the genome such as transposons and paralogous genes the resulting repeats pose a problem for assemblers which collapse them into single contigs because it is unknown how such collapsed repeats should be traversed i e which pairs of incoming and outgoing edges should be connected via the repeat a bubble cannot be detected thus in a de_novo variation detection setting bubble calling is not suitable to detect_cnvs the number of times a contig occurs in the genome can be inferred from read_depths exploiting the fact that assembly automatically segments the genome into contigs of integer copy_number previously the a statistic has been proposed to determine_whether a contig is unique or represents a collapsed repeat medvedev andestimated the copy to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com number of a contig using a maximum_likelihood flow solving algorithm assuming a known genome_size here we introduce a poisson_mixture pmm approach to estimate the copy_number cn of a contig without making assumptions on genome_size the use of a pmm for modelling read_depths in segments across multiple samples that have been mapped to a reference_genome was recently_introduced here we use a pmm in a de_novo setting to obtain a genome_wide model for one genome rather than in a local segment across multiple samples the algorithm relies on de_novo for segmentation we show how this mixture_model can be applied in coloured assembly graphs to detect_cnvs the algorithm was named magnolya matched genomes de_novo assembly_graph analysis in contrast to cortexs de_bruijn approach we use an overlap_layout assembler to generate a contig string_graph contig string graphs are generated by first calculating pairwise overlaps between reads a node in the resulting graph represents a read and an edge between two reads represents an overlap the graph is subsequently simplified by transitive_reduction which removes redundant edges followed by unitigging a process of collapsing simple paths without branches the result is a contig string_graph in which now the nodes represent collapsed reads called contigs and edges represent reads spanning two contigs the contigs cannot be collapsed further as for each pair of contigs connected by an edge the inor out degree dependent on strand is string_graph assemblers were first developed in the sanger era to assemble relatively long sequencing_reads the advent of nextgeneration_sequencing ngs yielding short_reads of length_bp required development of assemblers not reliant on pairwise overlaps of reads the widely used de_bruijn assemblers however increasing read_lengths produced by ngs_technology including the third generation single_molecule sequencers are renewing interest in overlap_layout assemblers such as string_graph assembler capable of efficiently assembling mammalian_genomes we extended the string_graph by assigning each read a colour corresponding to the sample from which it originated in the resulting coloured contig string_graph we then detect variation by modelling read_counts per colour with a mixture of poissons and inferring the probability of a cnv to our knowledge we here for the first time apply a pmm to detect_cnvs fully de_novo between samples from two individuals this approach has two main advantages first no read_count based_segmentation of the genome is required to distinguish regions with different copy_numbers this is handled in the co assembly second there is no bias to a possibly distant reference_genome in experiments copy_number estimation using magnolya is demonstrated both on simulated_data and on data from the genome of an allotriploid wine yeast furthermore cnv_detection with magnolya applied to co assemblies is tested on simulated_data and demonstrated on the aneuploid genomes of two saccharomyces pastorianus brewing yeasts and a laboratoryevolved yeast strain
