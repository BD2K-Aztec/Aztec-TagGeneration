gene_expression model_based for rna_seq motivation rna_seq technology has been widely_adopted as an attractive alternative to microarray based_methods to study global gene_expression however robust statistical_tools to analyze these complex datasets are still lacking by grouping genes with similar expression_profiles across treatments cluster_analysis provides insight into gene_functions and networks and hence is an important technique for rna_seq results in this manuscript we derive clustering_algorithms based on appropriate probability models for rna_seq an expectation_maximization and another two stochastic versions of expectation_maximization algorithms are described in addition a strategy for initialization based on likelihood is proposed to improve the clustering_algorithms moreover we present a model based hybrid hierarchical_clustering method to generate a tree_structure that allows visualization of relationships among clusters as well as flexibility of choosing the number of clusters results from both simulation_studies and analysis of a maize rna_seq dataset show that our proposed methods provide better clustering_results than alternative_methods such as the k means algorithm and hierarchical clustering_methods that are not based on probability models availability_and an r package mbcluster seq has been developed to implement our proposed algorithms this r package provides fast computation and is publicly_available at http www rnext generation sequencing ngs_technologies have revolutionized studies of genome_structure gene_expression and epigenetics one important application of ngs_technologies is in the study of gene_expression by measuring messenger_rna levels for all genes in a sample this technology is called rna_seq and several reviews have described this nascent technology here we briefly describe how rna_seq can be generated the complete set of messenger rna_molecules are first extracted from a sample and converted to a library of short complementary dna_fragments then these fragments are sequenced simultaneously by ngs_technology the resulting millions of short_sequences which are commonly called reads are then aligned to a reference_genome or reference transcripts gene_expression is measured by the enumeration of reads_mapped to each gene where the gene can be defined as a collection of exons or other appropriate definitions given the context of a study the resulting rna_seq are essentially digital signals that can be used to quantify levels of gene_expression this differs from microarray_technologies that measure gene_expression by fluorescence_intensities detected from hybridized samples inescapable factors such as cross_hybridization secondary_structure of the dna and technical_challenges associated with fluorescent detection used in microarray_analysis limit both the sensitivity and dynamic range compared with microarray_technologies ngs_technologies permit quantitative_measures of gene_expression over a much larger dynamic these advantages have rapidly accelerated the adoption of the ngs_technologies in studies of gene_expression and present new challenges to data analysis in the pioneering studies using rna_seq only two treatment groups were analyzed more recently rna_seq experiments that examined multiple treatment groups have been published for example carefully_selected a developing leaf from a corn plant that captures multiple_stages of photosynthetic differentiation they exploited illumina sequencing_technologies to profile gene_expression from four representative sections of the leaf blade one major_goal of this study was to survey gene_expression along different developmental_stages to gain understanding of the transcriptional_network associated with the development of c photosynthesis in this endeavor cluster_analysis is an important tool as it often reveals groups of genes with similar expression_patterns where genes within such groups tend to be functionally_related took a heuristic approach by applying the k means algorithm to partition log transformed_data for the differentially_expressed the k means algorithm starts from an initial partition of the objects genes and proceeds by iteratively calculating the centers means of clusters and reassigning each object to the closest cluster according to some measurement of distance such as euclidean_distance this iteration continues until no more reassignments take place although this heuristic approach is easy to implement its to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com performance was not evaluated for rna_seq studies of clustering_algorithms with microarray_data revealed that heuristic_algorithms performed_worse than model based_algorithms surprisingly there has been few published statistical research to examine cluster_analysis of rna_seq although it is urgently_needed due to the huge amount of data being generated model based_algorithms for microarray_data are based on finite_mixture of normal_distributions and cannot be directly applied to rna_seq that are discrete counts and often skewed rna_seq have been modeled using poisson or negative_binomial nb distributions witten describes a hierarchical_clustering method to cluster samples experimental units based on the rna_seq of all genes within each sample using poisson_model and dissimilarity measure based on likelihood_ratio statistics often the case as in clustering gene_expression is of interest in this article we aim to cluster genes based on the differential expression_patterns across treatments using modelbased statistical_methods in other words we are interested in grouping genes that share the same or similar expression foldchanges with respect to the mean expression_level across all treatments to do this we derive model_based algorithms for cluster genes based on either poisson or nb models for rna_seq and we evaluate the performance of the modelbased approach and heuristic_algorithms including the k means method to cluster genes we describe the poisson and nb distributions in section and show how our model_based method handles both probability models in a unified fashion we present an expectation_maximization em_algorithm for estimating the model_parameters and cluster membership in section in addition a model based initialization algorithm is proposed in section to reduce the dependence on the initialization we also describe two stochastic versions of em algorithms in section that are intended to reduce the chance of being trapped at local solutions a model based hierarchical algorithm is proposed in section to generate a hierarchical_structure of the clusters and allow more flexibility of choosing cluster numbers in section we simulate data and compare the proposed method with others using three commonly used criteria sensitivity specificity and mutual_information mi in section we apply the model_based to the data fromand evaluate our results by comparing the clusters with gene_annotations we summarize in section that our results from extensive_simulation and an analysis of an rna_seq dataset all show that our proposed_method alternative_methods namely the k means algorithm and self organizing map som in this article we derived clustering_algorithms based on finite_mixture of poisson or nb models we proposed an em_algorithm with model based initialization and show this initialization method greatly_improves the performance of the em clustering compared with heuristic_algorithms such as k means method our method has the following advantages first we build our approach of clustering rna_seq based on more appropriate probabilistic_models such as poisson and nb distributions owing to the nature of rna_seq technology the observed count_data are discrete and skewed poisson_model has been shown to fit well to data without biological_replicates and nb model to data with biological_replicates anders and b
