navigating protected genomics data with ucsc_genome in a box genome_browser in a box gbib is a small virtual_machine version of the popular university of california santa_cruz ucsc_genome that can be run on a researchers own computer once gbib is installed a standard web_browser is used to access the virtual server and add personal data_files from the local hard_disk annotation data are loaded on demand through the internet from ucsc or can be downloaded to the local computer for faster access availability_and software downloads and installation_instructions are freely_available use at https genome store ucsc edu gbib requires the installation of open_source virtualbox available for all major operating_systems and the ucsc_genome which is open_source and free for non commercial use commercial use of gbib and the genome_browser requires a licensecustom data display is a popular feature of modern genome_browsers allowing users to view their own private genome_annotations alongside publicly_available data the university of california santa_cruz ucsc_genome has supported user generated custom annotation tracks since and recently added support for track and assembly data hubs that allow the user to host collections of large data_files on a local server and configure many details of the visualization however these solutions require the data_files to be uploaded onto a web_server or stored on a genome_browsers servers a drawback that has become increasingly problematic as data file sizes expand and analysis involves sensitive genomic patient data locally installed genome_browser applications like integrative_genomics mitigate this problem but typically include significantly_fewer genome_annotations the ucsc_genome in a box gbib circumvents these issues offering secure local use of private data_files while still providing access to the full suite of ucsc_genome tools and annotations we use an x virtual_machine which simulates a complete computer guest on a normal pc host thanks to the hardware support offered by current cpus this configuration has become almost as fast as a real machine this kind of virtualization technology is the basis of cloud_computing typically used in bioinformatics to distribute analysis tasks on demand on machines offered by external providers virtualization tools have become very easy to install on personal_computers and therefore have been used to simplify the installation of complex bioinformatics_analysis tools like clovr and the encode_project analysis_pipeline for a website like the ucsc_genome the large amount of annotation data makes virtualization more difficultat the time of writing ucscs database includes more than tb of data for the v c the author published_by
