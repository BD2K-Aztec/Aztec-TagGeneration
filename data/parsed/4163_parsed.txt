genetics_and seca snp effect concordance analysis using genome_wide association summary results the genomics era provides opportunities to assess the genetic overlap across phenotypes at the measured genotype level however current approaches require individual_level genome_wide association gwa single_nucleotide snp_genotype in one or both of a pair of gwa samples to facilitate the discovery of pleiotropic_effects and examine genetic overlap across two phenotypes i have developed a user_friendly web_based application called seca to perform snp effect concordance analysis using gwa summary results epidemiological and clinical studies indicate many human complex_disorders co occur within an individual whereas family and twin_studies suggest correlations in familial and genetic liabilities since genome_wide gwas have been performed to identify common single_nucleotide snps associated with phenotypes disease endpoints or quantitative_traits a surprising finding of gwas is that many loci show pleiotropic_effects by being associated with more than one distinct phenotype a study of genes and snps listed in the nhgri catalog of published gwas www genome gov gwastudies accessed february found of genes and of snps show pleiotropic_effects identifying and taking_advantage of genetic overlap across phenotypes can improve detection of genetic risk_factors because when risk is correlated across phenotypes pooled analyses will be better powered than individual disorder analyses genetic overlap can also help determine_whether our current_classification and categorization of diseases are valid or whether genetic_similarities traverse current divisions understanding pleiotropic_effects is also important for drug_development for example if a gene has opposing effects on different common diseases drug_development and marketing will be greatly complicated knowledge of pleiotropic associations could help to predict and avoid adverse_side polygenic prediction or genetic_risk grs analysis and bivariate linear_mixed bivariate gcta analysis have recently been developed to assess the genetic overlap across phenotypes grs analysis requires gwas summary results for a discovery sample dataset to construct a score in an independent target sample dataset by forming the weighted_sum of associated alleles i e a grs within each subject thus requiring individual_level gwa snp_genotype for the target sample association between the grs and a phenotype in the target sample implies genetic overlap between the discovery and target phenotypes the bivariate gcta approach_requires individual_level population_based gwa snp_genotype for both the discovery and target sample to estimate the genetic_correlation explained by snps between pairs of quantitative_traits or pairs of binary_traits for example the snp based genetic_correlation r g snp will be positive when the cases of one discovery trait show higher genetic_similarity i e pairwise genetic_relationship estimated from genome_wide snp_genotype to the cases of the other target trait than they do to their own discovery controls the sharing of individual_level genotype and phenotype data requires application material transfer agreement informed_consent and ethical consideration given most large gwa studies meta analyze summary results from multiple independent samples the sharing of individual_level gwa snp_genotype is often difficult if not impossible therefore to overcome these challenges i have developed a user_friendly webbased application called seca to perform snp effect concordance analysis using gwas summary results using publicly_available gwas summary data seca corroborates recent results from the cross disorder group of the psychiatric genomics consortium finding significant polygenic overlap between bipolar_disorder major_depressive schizophrenia and autism_spectrum but generally not with attention_deficit further details and results are provided in the supplementary_material
