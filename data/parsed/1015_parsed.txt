systems_biology cmgrn a web_server for constructing multilevel gene_regulatory using chip_seq and gene_expression data chip_seq technology provides an accurate characterization of transcription or epigenetic_factors binding on genomic_sequences with integration of such chip based and other high_throughput information it would be dedicated to dissecting cross interactions among multilevel regulators genes and biological_functions here we devised an integrative web_server cmgrn con structing multilevel gene_regulatory to unravel hierarchical interactive networks at different regulatory levels the newly_developed used the bayesian_network modeling to infer causal interrelationships among transcription_factors or epigenetic_modifications by using chip_seq moreover it used bayesian_hierarchical with gibbs_sampling to incorporate binding signals of these regulators and gene_expression together for reconstructing gene_regulatory the example applications indicate that cmgrn provides an effective web_based framework that is able to integrate heterogeneous high_throughput data and to reveal hierarchical regulome and the associated gene_expression programs the combinational performance of transcriptional and epigenetic_factors is central regulatory_mechanisms to control gene_expression networks a fundamental challenge in post genome era is to dissect such complex regulation associations underlying biological_functions chip_seq technology allows high_fidelity mapping of different regulators such as transcription_factors tfs or epigenetic_modifications to genomic_locations thus providing a basis for profiling transcriptional or epigenetic regulatory_relationships accurate binding features of these factors on the genomic_sequences can also be used to identify regulatory_modules and reconstruct gene_regulatory grns various algorithms and computational_methods have been proposed to investigate gene_regulation promoted by cooperation of tfs and epigenetic_alterations some online tools or servers were designed to build grns derived from chip_seq for instance cscan and chip array although the existing web_based software can predict potential target_genes of the multiple regulators they are not able to discover hierarchical organizations formed by cross interactions between the regulators and genes simultaneously currently there is a lack of effective web resources to generate the topology of networks controlled by the interacting_factors at transcriptional post_transcriptional and epigenetic layers to provide an easy to use bioinformatics tool to interpret these chip_seq high_throughput data we devised an integrative web_server constructing multilevel gene_regulatory cmgrn to unveil interrelationships between tfs or epigenetic_modifications and to robustly construct hierarchical regulatory network_structures in biological complex systems it is system wide and enables biologists to analyze the mixture information of chip_seq and gene_expression levels using standard data formatted with minimal need of bioinformatics skills
