gene_expression nucleofinder a statistical_approach for the detection of nucleosome_positions motivation the identification of nucleosomes along the chromatin is key to understanding their role in the regulation of gene_expression and other dna related processes however current experimental methods mnase chip mnase seq sample nucleosome_positions from a cell_population and contain biases making thus the precise identification of individual nucleosomes not straightforward recent works have only focused on the first point where noise_reduction approaches have been developed to identify nucleosome_positions results in this article we propose a new approach termed nucleofinder that addresses both the positional heterogeneity across cells and experimental biases by seeking nucleosomes consistently positioned in a cell_population and showing a significant_enrichment relative to a control sample despite the absence of validated dataset we show that our approach i detects fewer false posi tives than two other nucleosome calling methods and ii identifies two important features of the nucleosome_organization the nucleosome spacing downstream of active promoters and the enrichment deple tion of gc at dinucleotides at the centre of in vitro nucleosomes with equal or greater ability than the other two methods availability the r code of nucleofinder an example datafile and instructions are available for download from https sites google comeukaryotic genomes exist in highly packaged structures called chromatin dna wraps around globular protein cores and appears as beads on a string by electron_microscopy the bead or nucleosome is the fundamental structural_unit of the chromatin and consists of base_pairs coiled times around a histone_octamer core comprising two h a h b and two h h heterodimers the string also called the linker is a dna stretch ranging from to bp depending on species cell_type and chromatin region nucleosomes can further be folded into higher_order organizations to eventually form a chromosome the need for these high_level structures arises from a packaging problem the dna_molecule is long chromosomes range from to cm in human and negatively_charged resulting in electrostatic repulsions that stiffen the polymer and prevent it from fitting inside the nucleus owing to the highly basic charge of histone_proteins dna charges are neutralized allowing a compaction up to a factor of this compaction is not homogeneous throughout the genome and restricts both the binding of transcription_factors and the recruitment of effector protein_complexes such as chromatin_remodelling complexes to certain regions chromatin has commonly been viewed as being in either an active form euchromatin or a repressed form heterochromatin the former characteristic of active transcribed regions is lightly packed up to the nm fiber compaction and allows regulatory_proteins and transcription_complexes to bind to the dna the latter tightly_packed is associated with gene_silencing and the protection of chromosome structures such as centromeres and telomeres because of its influence on the binding of transcription_factors the packaging of dna into nucleosomes provides important regulatory_functions in yeast for instance demonstrated that gene activation and repression are associated with changes eviction appearance or repositioning of one or two nucleosomes in promoter_regions the development of high_throughput assays has allowed the mapping of nucleosomes across the genomes of various model_organisms these recent_studies have revealed common features across species at expressed genes i the sim base_pairs region upstream of the transcription_start tss is depleted of nucleosomes ii nucleosomes show a regular spacing at the end of genes and iii this regular nucleosome spacing also called phasing gradually decreases from the to the end of the coding_region even if our understanding of the nucleosome_organization has considerably improved the questions of the relative influence of cis and trans factors in the nucleosome_organization as well as the role of nucleosome_positioning in gene to whom correspondence should be addressed the recent development of high_throughput methods has provided a global insight into how the combination of nucleosome_positions and their post_transcriptional are key to gene_regulation the precise identification of nucleosomes is therefore crucial to understanding what determines the nucleosome architecture and how changes in this organization induce variation in gene_expression this task is made non trivial by the fact that nucleosomes are assayed across cell_populations and consequently result in complex patterns of reads another difficulty also arises from the known bias of mnase toward at ta motifs which potentially can limit the accuracy of nucleosome detection from our knowledge no existing mnase seq methods have addressed this issue to fill this gap
