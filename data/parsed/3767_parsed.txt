protpos a python_package for the prediction of protein preferred orientation on a surface atomistic molecular_dynamics is a promising technique to investigate the energetics and dynamics in the proteinsurface adsorption_process which is of high relevance to modern biotechnological_applications to increase the chance of success in simulating the adsorp tion process favorable orientations of the protein at the surface must be determined here we present protpos which is a lightweight and easy to use python_package that can predict low_energy protein orientations on a surface of interest it combines a fast conformational_sampling algorithm with the energy calculation of gromacs the advantage of protpos is it allows users to select any force_fields suitable for the system at hand and provide structural output readily available for further simulation_studies availability_and protpos is freely_available for academic and non profit uses atunderstanding the mechanisms of protein_adsorption on surfaces is important for many biotechnological_applications such as the design of medical implants protein biochips drug_delivery and point of care devices etc by virtue of molecular_modeling and simulations the protein_adsorption processes its dynamics and subsequent proteinsurface interactions can be studied at the molecular or atomic_level of detail however a successful simulation of the adsorption_process depends largely on the initial protein orientation relative to the surface to avoid sampling protein trajectory which will eventually fail to adsorb a work around is to firstly determine the preferred orientations of the protein and use them as starting structures in molecular_simulations essentially a search for the low_energy protein orientation on a given surface is an optimization_process which includes a conformation generation strategy and a scoring_function for the former a systematic rotation and translation of the protein or a monte_carlo is commonly used for this structure_determination problem a simplified scoring_function accounting for only proteinsurface interactions is usually preferred for higher computational_efficiency interaction parameters can be taken from an empirical force_field or modification from the scoring_function of a docking method interestingly unlike other structure prediction_problems such as proteinligand docking or proteinprotein_docking where numerous tools exist to simplify the prediction task there are only limited choices available for fast proteinsurface structure_prediction one such option is rosettasurface which is included in the rosetta molecular_modeling package and hence the use of rosettasurface entails a deep learning_curve other prediction_methods mentioned above to our knowledge are unavailable publicly for general use hence to fill this gap we have developed a self contained lightweight and easy to use software_package called prediction of protein preferred orientation on a surface protpos based on the protein surface docking method described in it combines particle_swarm pso algorithm with energy_minimization to perform global and local_search over six degrees_of of the protein_translation and rotation on v c the author published_by
