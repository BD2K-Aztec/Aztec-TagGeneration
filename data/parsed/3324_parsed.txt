systems_biology omicsanalyzer a cytoscape plug in suite for modeling omics_data omicsanalyzer is a cytoscape plug in for visual omics based network_analysis that i integrates hetero omics_data for one or more species ii performs statistical_tests on the integrated datasets and iii visualizes results in a network context availability implemented_in omicsanalyzer runs with cytoscape and binaries documentation and video walkthroughs are freely_available atthe widespread use of omics related biotechnologies has led to many heterogeneous omics_datasets software_packages facilitate the interpretation of omics_data by using graph models where nodes represent bio elements and edges are bio interactions between these elements however the complexity of biological_systems and omics_datasets require an integrative analytical environment which allows network manipulation at different levels of detail flexible mappings between multiple omics_datasets coupled with data visualization and providing statistical_analysis and system simulation and visualization of resulting analysis cytoscape an open_source platform software dedicated to network modeling in biology provides a highly_flexible environment for combining these elements to meet the above requirements omicsanalyzer i manipulates networks through interface connection with third_party plug_ins ii maps omics_datasets within or across species and manages the datasets iii visualizes dynamic data using plots and animations and iv analyzes data using built in statistical functions the integration of these key analysis functionalities is a key building_block for omics_data analysis in systems_biology
