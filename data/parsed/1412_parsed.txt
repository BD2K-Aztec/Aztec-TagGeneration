gene_expression discrete mixture modeling to address genetic_heterogeneity in time to event regression motivation time to event regression_models are a critical tool for associating survival time outcomes with molecular data despite mounting evidence that genetic subgroups of the same clinical disease exist little attention has been given to exploring how this hetero geneity affects time to event model_building and how to accommodate it methods able to diagnose and model heterogeneity should be valuable additions to the biomarker_discovery toolset results we propose a mixture of survival functions that classifies subjects with similar relationships to a time to event response this model incorporates multivariate_regression and model_selection and can be fit with an expectation_maximization we call cox assisted clustering we illustrate a likely manifestation of genetic het erogeneity and demonstrate how it may affect survival models with little warning an application to gene_expression in ovarian_cancer dna_repair illustrates how the model may be used to learn new genetic subsets for risk_stratification we explore the implications of this model for censored observations and the effect on genomic pre dictors and diagnostic analysis availability_and r implementation of cac using standard packages is available at https gist github com programeng b b b edf f data used in the analysis are publicly_available in cancer genomic studies unobserved heterogeneity obfuscates the effort to build accurate descriptive models of risk_stratification in ovarian_cancer for example argue that the set of patients with the same clinical disease have distinct_molecular diseases with respect to inference this implies that the same regression_models may not be valid for every patient and further that it is unclear which patients should be considered together therefore a major statistical task is to organize patients into previously_unknown classes while simultaneously fitting their time to event models the examples throughout the article are taken from our ongoing analysis of data from the cancer_genome tcga which has the goal of cataloging all of the genomic_alterations in cancer for each patient there is a tremendous amount and variety of data genes in expression arrays million singlenucleotide polymorphism genotypes exome and whole genome_sequences methylation of thousands of cpg islands and the expression of microrna from this plurality of data we anticipate that exploratory methods will serve to extract and characterize genetic subgroups relevant to survival time clinical_outcomes for summarizing the impact of a genetic signature one often stratifies patients to demonstrate separation between classdefined survival_curve estimates unfortunately asreview current methods either awkwardly dichotomize a continuous score at a post_hoc threshold or rely on hierarchical_clustering to define subgroups with no necessary relation to survival in that sense it is desirable to have a method that identifies genetic subgroups supervised by their survival_times the standard methods for dealing with non homogenous time to event data do not apply when our goal is to discover unknown subgroups continuous frailty models treat all individuals separately and therefore do not produce subgroups oemphasize the use of random_effects and stratified regression_models when subgroups are known classification_and methods have been adapted for survival responses however these methods partition the predictor space to form a single piecewise functional estimate and our interest is in the subgroups that exist in similar regions some treatment of heterogeneity relevant to survival time where a subgroup of patients does not expire appears in the cure_rate model literature our situation is distinct in three ways a subgroup may have variable time to event outcomes cured patients have infinite survival_times the variables of interest to each mixture component may be distinct and the set of patients in each subgroup is not known in this article we propose a discrete mixture regression_model that synergizes with potential heterogeneity in time to event data concretely we assume that observations belong to unlabeled classes with class specific proportional_hazards ph regression_models relating their genetic covariates to survival time outcomes section this conditional semi_parametric model leads to a surprising variety of model effects which we illustrate to whom correspondence should be

highlight the use of censored_data section and a data analysis demonstrates a single pathway hypothesis driven model section our discussion section again emphasizes the exploratory role that this analysis may address in this article we have presented a model for heterogeneity in time to event data although its actual formulation is straightforward the treatment of unknown classification a consideration of the implications for censoring the effect on genomic predictors and diagnostic analysis have not been previously_considered finally we have presented a novel and informative analysis in section which begins to identify the set of survivalassociated and subgroup dependent alterations in expression admirably this model relaxes the whole model ph assumption to conditional ph given cluster membership in an exploratory situation the utility of this flexibility cannot be overstated both our simulated and applied analysis highlight that our understanding of censoring has been augmented and the use of information in the model is intuitively simple in a data analytic view informaticists are familiar with unsupervised_clustering analysis and class label supervised clustering analysis our algorithm may be seen as a way to use a survival time possibly censored to supervise the clustering of gene_expression data this clustering property is distinct from ensemble type methods e g where covariate information may be used to reweight components as we saw with its treatment of posterior class probabilities the mixture believes each observation comes from a single component while averaging over weak learners or hidden layers may be relevant to a more admixed sample with respect to developing ovarian_cancer biomarkers our data analysis has shown an example where class identification leads to risk_stratification we might further identify high and low_risk classes within the assigned clusters as is standard practice but this is no longer a required post_processing part of the expression analysis the cac algorithm has also given us its posterior weights allowing a concrete measure of uncertainty for downstream_analyses in the tcga project as in many other cancer genomic studies there are issues of both high_dimensional and variable_selection as presented the cac regression_framework does not incorporate these but it can be extended with additional study
