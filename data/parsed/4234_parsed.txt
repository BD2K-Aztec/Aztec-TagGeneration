bioinformatics btq tex data_and sicago semi_supervised cluster_analysis using semantic distance between gene_pairs in gene_ontology despite the importance of using the semantic distance to improve the performance of conventional expression based clustering there are few freely_available software that provides a clustering_algorithm using the ontology_based semantic distances as prior_knowledge here we present the sicago semi_supervised cluster_analysis using semantic distance between gene_pairs in gene_ontology system that helps to discover the groups of genes more effectively using prior_knowledge extracted from gene_ontology availability based on the assumption that genes with similar expression_patterns are more likely to have similar biological_functions many clustering_algorithms have been used to predict the function of a gene from the known functions of other genes in the cluster however most existing_methods are limited in improving the clustering performance since microarray_expression are noisy noise comes from the damage caused by the experimental device or observing system error thus it has been observed that some genes with similar expression_patterns do not have common biological_characteristics in some cases coregulated genes did not exhibit similar expression_patterns new clustering_approaches have been proposed to handle the limitations of the conventional methods they attempted to incorporate prior_biological into clustering_algorithms exploiting known gene_functions in the process of clustering the machine_learning community terms this semi_supervised clustering it uses existing domain_knowledge to guide the clustering process it is observed that incorporating biological_knowledge into cluster_analysis is effective in obtaining reliable clustering performance and interpreting the analysis results of expression data with high noise levels the best known approach to incorporating biological_knowledge is to measure the semantic distance between known genes in gene_ontology this go based distance between two genes is incorporated into the expression based distance during the process to whom correspondence should be addressed of clustering information content theory has been widely used to measure a semantic distance between genes in go despite the importance of utilizing the semantic distance into cluster_analysis few freely_available application programs can perform clustering using the ontology_based semantic distances as prior_biological we have developed a software_program sicago a tool for semi_supervised cluster_analysis using semantic distance between gene_pairs in gene_ontology to satisfy these needs sicago supports i three well known semantic distance measures based on information content thus we can see which type of semantic distance is most effective to construct prior_knowledge using go it also supports ii three gene ontologies so that we can analyze how the difference of semantic distance between two genes according to go structures influences clustering performance finally it supports iii the most widely used k_means algorithm so that we can analyze the effectiveness of semi_supervised clustering when prior_knowledge was incorporated shows the schematic diagram of sicago software it performs three tasks semantic calculation semantic correlation and cluster_analysis a system interface lets users to upload an input_file and then select the type of task in order the source is freely_available and modified under gnu gpl task i of sicago semantic calculation provides the semantic distances between gene_pairs in go three well known semantic distance measures are supported to achieve this these measures are based on information content theory where the semantic_similarity between genes is determined by the amount of information they share in common this shared_information is computed using the set of parent nodes genes the more parents two genes share the more similar they are the ontology selection in sicago provides three domains of go biological_process bp that indicates the operations of molecular_events with a defined beginning and end cellular_component cc that indicates the parts of a cell or its extracellular_environment and molecular_function mf that indicates the elemental activities of a gene_product at the molecular level after users select the type of semantic measure and type of ontology sicago calculates all the semantic distances between genes in the ontology task ii semantic correlation provides the semantic distance results between two genes obtained from task i sicago shows the comparative results for the two genes picked by users using three distance measures expression based euclidean_distance gobased semantic distance and correlation_coefficient users can see the difference between expression and ontology_based distance results we showed the distance between two genes in the ontology using a tree view to understand the semantic distance better task iii cluster_analysis provides the semi_supervised k_means algorithm we amended the distance between a gene and a group calculation method to exploit the prior_knowledge generated from the selected ontology and semantic distance we modified the distance measure dist between a gene g and a group g to be a linear combination of their expression based euclidean correlation distance and their semantic distance to select a cluster where a gene is assigned thus dist g g is defined by
