a multiobjective memetic algorithm for ppi network_alignment motivation there recently has been great interest in aligning proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks to identify potentially orthologous_proteins between species it is thought that the topo logical information contained in these networks will yield better orthology predictions than sequence_similarity alone recent work has found that existing aligners have difficulty making use of both topological and sequence_similarity when aligning with either one or the other being better matched this can be at least partially attributed to the fact that existing aligners try to combine these two potentially conflicting objectives into a single objective results we present optnetalign a multiobjective memetic algorithm for the problem of ppi network_alignment that uses extremely efficient swap based local_search mutation and crossover operations to create a population of alignments this algorithm optimizes the conflicting goals of topological and sequence_similarity using the concept of pareto dominance exploring the tradeoff between the two objectives as it runs this allows us to produce many high_quality candidate alignments in a single run our algorithm produces alignments that are much better compromises between topological and biological match quality than previous work while better characterizing the diversity of possible good alignments between two networks our aligners results have several interesting implications_for on alignment evaluation the design of network_alignment objectives and the interpretation of alignment results availability_and the c source_code to our program along with compilation and usage instructions is available at httpsas the sizes of known proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks grow so does interest in analyzing them one of the more ambitious efforts in this area is aligning the ppi_networks of two different species with the goal of identifying orthologous_proteins as well as shared pathways and complexes that hint at the ppi_network of a common_ancestor there has already been a good deal of progress in this area with past work reporting success in finding large shared subnetworks between saccharomyces_cerevisiae and homo_sapiens as well as success in reconstructing phylogeny based on network overlap discovered by an aligner despite these successes ppi network_alignment is a young research area the incomplete noisy nature of existing ppi_networks makes alignment difficult with existing aligners performing dramatically better on noise_free synthetic networks compared with noisy real_world networks furthermore it has been found that the two objectives of biological and topological fit that these aligners optimize conflict to a larger extent than previously realized different aligners construct alignments that are dramatically different with some optimizing topological fit at the v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please email journals permissions_oup com doi bioinformatics btv advance_access date february original paper expense of sequence_similarity while others do the opposite while some of these aligners provide a user controlled parameter for adjusting between optimizing one objective over the other even when this parameter is adjusted as widely as possible existing aligners only output alignments in small non overlapping regions of objective space that are often quite distant from each other lastly these aligners tend to produce very different alignments sometimes agreeing on as few as of their total aligned pairs which makes it necessary for the user to run many different aligners to get an idea of the many alignments possible the difficulties with the conflict between topological and biological fit and the disparate results of existing aligners show that the problem of ppi network_alignment is far from solved to this end we introduce a multiobjective memetic algorithm optnetalign optimizing network aligner for performing network_alignment unlike most existing aligners which use custom_built estimators of node similarity which dont always have a clear connection to final alignment_quality we use a multiobjective memetic algorithm which can produce a large number of diverse high_quality alignments in a single run our approach is able to better optimize both the topological and sequence_similarity of the proteins aligned and instead of arbitrarily emitting a single alignment at one point in objective space optnetalign produces a pareto front of alignments that characterize the wide_variety of possible tradeoffs between the conflicting objectives of network_alignment this tends to produce a wider variety of alignments than using all previously created aligners together and these alignments tend to be comparable to or of better quality than those produced by previous aligners
