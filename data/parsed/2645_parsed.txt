sequence_analysis kinannote a computer program to identify and classify members of the eukaryotic protein_kinase superfamily motivation kinases of the eukaryotic protein_kinase superfamily are key_regulators of most aspects eukaryotic cellular_behavior and have provided several drug_targets including kinases dysregulated in cancers the rapid increase in the number of genomic_sequences has created an acute need to identify and classify members of this important class of enzymes efficiently and accurately results kinannote produces a draft kinome and comparative_analyses for a predicted proteome using a single_line command and it is currently the only tool that automatically classifies protein_kinases using the controlled_vocabulary of hanks and hunter hanks and hunter a hidden_markov in combination with a position_specific is used by kinannote to identify kinases which are subsequently classified using a blast comparison with a local version of kinbase the curated protein_kinase dataset from www kinase com kinannote was tested on the predicted proteomes from four divergent_species the average sensitivity and precision for kinome retrieval from the test species are and the ability of kinannote to classify identified kinases was also evaluated and the average sensitivity and precision for full classification of conserved kinases are and respectively kinannote has had a significant impact on eukaryotic genome_annotation providing protein_kinase annotations for genomes made public by the broad institute in the period spanning to the present availability kinannote is freely_available sourceforge net pro jects kinannote protein_kinases are well studied enzymes involved in the regulation of the majority of eukaryotic cellular_processes mutations in protein_kinases frequently cause human disease and kinases have provided several drug_targets protein_kinases act by transferring phosphate_groups from atp to the amino_acid of target_proteins a modification that often profoundly alters the biological_activity of the target_molecule there are hundreds of types of protein_kinases which despite their common mechanism act specifically on diverse substrates and are themselves acted on by diverse regulators the complete set of protein_kinases or kinome encoded in an organisms genome has a profound impact on the biological_properties of that organism for example the advent of the tyrosine_kinase tk group of kinases protein_kinase category abbreviations are in supplementary correlates with the rise of the metazoans it is often possible to infer the function or specificity of a kinase discovered in a new organism by comparison with known examples as many kinases are well conserved the task of relating a new kinase to a known one has been facilitated by work on the classification and evolution of protein_kinases and kinbase www kinase com these studies show that most protein_kinases belong to the eukaryotic protein_kinase epk superfamily whose members share a common_ancestry and fold the epk superfamily is divided_into eight major groups which are themselves divided_into families and subfamilies supplementary although not all families fall within one of the major groups most epks are recognized by similarity to hidden_markov profiles such as the pkinase hmm http pfam sanger ac uk but members of several families are divergent and are often overlooked in searches targeted toward typical kinases although a core_set of the epks is conserved across eukaryotes this superfamily is plastic and prone to expansion the hierarchical_structure of the classification system of hanks hunter and manning is well suited to handle this plasticity as it allows partial classification of newly_discovered kinases and informatively describes relationships between similar but non orthologous kinases a much smaller number of protein_kinases designated atypical protein_kinases apks have either limited similarity to epks protein_kinase like sequences or pkls or differ from them altogether and also differ from each other well conserved apks have been annotated in several curated kinomes and are included in kinbase www kinase com the surge in the availability of genomic_data has created a need to automate identification and classification of conserved to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work and novel protein_kinases current identification methods favor searches against protein_kinase hidden_markov hmms from pfam or kinomer and searches against position_specific pssms from the conserved_domain these methods effectively_identify average kinases but are often unable to identify novel or divergent superfamily members moreover classification based on pfam and kinomer hmms does not exceed the group level sequence_similarity against a specialized database e g kinbase provide more complete classification of kinases from families represented in the database but results for novel kinases may be difficult_to and the diversity of the epk superfamily does not lend itself to application of a universal score threshold orthology based_methods can provide accurate classification but their success hinges on the availability of appropriate reference data an ortholog must be present and identified in the reference_genome to make a classification in the target_genome thus nonorthologous kinases will be overlooked none of the aforementioned methods are able to generate an accurate kinome without manual_curation by a knowledgeable user and therefore are not viable solutions to high_throughput kinase annotation here we present kinannote an epk identification and classification package that leverages a protein_kinase hmm and similarity with known kinases to produce a high_quality draft kinome for a given gene_set with a single command kinannote depends on two readily available third_party programs blast and hmmer and its input is a single fasta formatted file which may contain the complete set of predicted proteins from an organism or as few as one sequence the classifications produced by kinannote are constructed according to the controlled_vocabulary introduced by hanks and hunter and maintained at www kinase com this allows information about related_kinases to be directly mapped to newly classified kinases from the literature and resources such as prokino the protein_kinase resource king and phosphosite kinannote generates several files including a table of kinases and their classifications and phylogenetic profiles of discovered kinases we show that kinannote performs well on four reference kinomes broadly representative of the eukaryotic tree of life amphimedon queenslandica schizosaccharomyces_pombe plasmodium_falciparum and giardia_lamblia and describe its use to provide kinome annotations for eukaryotic_genomes released by the broad institute from through the time of publication www
