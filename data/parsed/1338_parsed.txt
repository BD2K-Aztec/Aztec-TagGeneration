desubs an r package for flexible identifica tion of differentially_expressed subpathways using rna_seq experiments desubs is a network based systems_biology r package that extracts disease perturbed subpathways within a pathway network as recorded by rna_seq experiments it contains an extensive and customized framework with a broad range of operation modes at all stages of the subpath way analysis enabling so a case specific approach the operation modes include pathway network construction and processing subpathway extraction visualization and enrichment_analysis with regard to various biological and pharmacological features its capabilities render it as a tool guide for both the modeler and experimentalist for the identification of more robust systems level drug_targets and biomarkers for complex_diseases availability_and desubs is implemented as an r package following bioconductor guidelines permanently available in url http biosignal med upatras gr wordpress desubs in the last years systems level network based_approaches have gained ground in the research field of systems_biology towards this direction the research_community has been focusing on the analysis of subpathways namely local gene sub regions within a pathway network approaches in this direction are essential for identifying more accurate system level drug_targets and biomarkers for complex_diseases by monitoring the local functions of networks perturbed by diseases hence several subpathway based tools have been developed recently focusing though predominantly on differentially_expressed de genes meanwhile since the amount of rna_seq transcriptome_studies is increasing rapidly year by year there is high_demand for tailored differential_expression de analysis tools although most de tools are crucial components in pathway analysis workflows there is a gap in addressing this issue through an extensive and customized subpathway based_approach using de analysis for rna_seq towards this orientation we developed an r package called desubs which extracts differentially_expressed subpathways based on rna_seq expression_profiles enabling so a customized analysis to the problem under investigation through numerous operation modes desubs offers a systematic way to uncover the local perturbations within a net
