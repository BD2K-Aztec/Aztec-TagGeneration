a profile_based method for identifying func tional divergence of orthologous_genes in bac terial genomes motivation next_generation have provided us with a wealth of information on genetic_variation but predicting the functional significance of this variation is a difficult_task while many comparative_genomics studies have focused on gene flux and large_scale changes relatively little attention has been paid to quantifying the effects of single_nucleotide and indels on protein_function particularly in bacterial genomics results we present a hidden_markov based_approach we call delta bitscore dbs for identifying orthologous_proteins that have diverged at the amino_acid level in a way that is likely to impact biological_function we benchmark this approach with several widely used datasets and apply it to a proof_of study of orthologous proteomes in an investigation of host adaptation in salmonella_enterica we highlight the value of the method in identifying functional_divergence of genes and suggest that this tool may be a better approach than the commonly used dn_ds metric for identifying functionally_significant genetic changes occurring in recently diverged organisms genome sequencing_technologies allow us to explore the wealth of genetic_variation between and within species and as these technologies advance this data is becoming progressively cheaper faster and easier to produce however analysis of the functional impact of genetic_variation has lagged behind and has largely focused on the presence_or of macroscopic features such as particular genes genomic islands or plasmids comparative sequence analyses have become common and exploration of genetic_variation between closely_related organisms has provided key insights into bacterial evolution in particular the analysis of single_nucleotide snps has been a tremendous boon to the study of bacterial_populations allowing for the construction of phylogenetic_trees which provide information on disease transmission and adaptation at scales ranging from global pandemics to outbreaks within single hospital_wards still the functional analysis of these snps insertions and associate editor dr inanc birol the author s published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work deletions within protein_sequences remains difficult and often relies on inappropriate tools such as dn_ds how then can the significance of fine_scale genetic_variation be quantified and prioritized for investigation recent_studies that even single snps can have dramatic effects on major phenotypes such as host tropism studies of pathogen adaptation for example the adaptation of pseudomonas_aeruginosa to the cystic_fibrosis lung or of salmonella_enterica to immunocompromised populations often result in findings of hundreds to thousands of snps and small_indels in coding_regions genome_wide provide one method for interpreting this variation however the clonal nature of many pathogens can make such study_designs difficult if not impossible to pursue and require large_sample to be effective the development of fast and accurate ways to assess the functional impact of variation between strains and prioritize coding variants for follow_up work is an important step in extracting meaning from comparative_analyses our strategy uses a profile hmm based_approach profile_hmms are probabilistic_models of multiple_sequence for each column in the alignment they capture information on the expected frequency of occurrence of different amino_acids insertions and deletions we can then use this information to compute a score which we call deltabitscore dbs for reasons explained below that quantifies the divergence of two protein_sequences with respect to the conservation patterns captured by the profile hmm our key assumption in this is that variation in positions conserved across a protein_family are more likely to affect protein_function than variation in less conserved positions similar assumptions have had success in a number of applications such as the prediction of trna pseudogenes and protein_folds our approach is unique in both the simplicity of the measure used and its flexibility making it well suited to comparative_genomic applications we demonstrate that our method is effective using several commonly used protein mutagenesis datasets particularly when used with automatically constructed protein_alignments we provide an example of a comparative_genomic by applying our approach to a whole proteome_analysis of a well studied case of host adaptation in salmonella_enterica serovars enteritidis and gallinarum using a purpose built collection of hmms we additionally show these results generalize to other host adapted salmonellae finally we compare our method to a popular estimate of selection dn_ds and find that the two measures are only weakly correlated this adds to the evidence that dn_ds is not an appropriate measure for inferring selection for gene function within bacterial_populations we have described a surprisingly simple method for identifying functional_divergence in orthologous_proteins including analysis of both point_mutations and indel events despite the simplicity of the dbs measure its accuracy is similar to state of the art methods for predicting the functional impact of sequence_variants while curated pfam models were less sensitive they have a high_specificity at conservative scoring thresholds see supplementary supplementary the workflow for using such models is simpler see supplementary and may be more appropriate for investigations where a low falsepositive rate is more important than detection of all loss_of in addition while construction of custom models can be timeconsuming to run on a desktop computer pfam annotation can be performed rapidly because other methods for estimating the impact of sequence_variation such as sift provean and mutationassessor require the user to specify mutations individually broad_scale comparative proteome_analysis such as this is difficult and time intensive to perform and not all methods are able to score indels or more than one mutation in the same sequence both dbs approaches scale to whole proteome_analysis with minimal user involvement see github page for pipelines and were able to detect additional loss_of that were missed by previous_studies focused on protein truncations and frameshifts
