data_and spici a fast clustering_algorithm for large biological_networks motivation clustering_algorithms play_an in the analysis of biological_networks and can be used to uncover functional_modules and obtain hints about cellular_organization while most available clustering_algorithms work well on biological_networks of moderate_size such as the yeast protein physical interaction_network they either fail or are too slow in practice for larger_networks such as functional_networks for higher_eukaryotes since an increasing number of larger biological_networks are being determined the limitations of current clustering_approaches curtail the types of biological network_analyses that can be performed results we present a fast local network clustering_algorithm spici spici runs in time o v log v e and space o e where v and e are the number of vertices and edges in the network respectively we evaluate spicis performance on several existing protein_interaction of varying_size and compare spici to nine previous_approaches for clustering biological_networks we show that spici is typically several orders_of than previous_approaches and is the only one that can successfully cluster all test networks within very short time we demonstrate that spici has state of the art performance with respect to the quality of the clusters it uncovers as judged by its ability to recapitulate protein_complexes and functional_modules finally we demonstrate the power of our fast network clustering_algorithm by applying spici across hundreds of large context specific human networks and identifying modules specific for single conditions availability source_code is available under the gnu public license athigh throughput experimental_technologies along with computational predictions have resulted in large_scale biological_networks for numerous organisms in recent_years much research_effort has focused on analyzing these biological_networks in order to obtain hints about cellular_organization and functioning clustering is perhaps the most common approach for global network_analysis and is frequently_applied to uncover functional_modules and protein to whom correspondence should be addressed complexes and to infer protein_function as a result numerous clustering_algorithms for biological_networks have been developed e g previous methods for clustering biological_networks work well on networks of moderate_size however the size and number of biological_networks continue to grow for example by extensive data_integration proteome scale functional_networks have been built for hundreds of organisms across the evolutionary spectrum recently by additionally considering specific biological_processes bps of interest hundreds of context specific functional_networks for human have been built moreover in the near future biological_networks will include numerous additional biological_entities such as non_coding as well as a wider_range of interaction types large_networks present considerable challenges for existing clustering_approaches here we develop a new efficient network clustering_algorithm spici spicy speed and performance in clustering spici builds clusters greedily starting from local seeds that have high weighted degree and adding nodes that maintain the density of the clusters and are adjacent to a suitable fraction of nodes within them the intuition underlying spici is similar to that of dpclus however spici exploits a simpler cluster expansion approach uses a different seed selection criterion and incorporates interaction confidences approaches based on enumeration have also been developed these aim to uncover all clusters with specific density requirements cfinder finds clusters such that each consists of a maximal connected component of adjacent cliques of size k where two cliques are adjacent if they share k nodes an alternate approach relaxes the requirement of complete cliques and instead finds all subsets of nodes with high_density while these approaches guarantee that they output all clusters with a particular property they are computationally_intensive in contrast spici takes a heuristic approach with respect to the clusters it outputs but guarantees a runtime of o v logv e where v and e are the number of vertices and edges in the network we demonstrate spicis excellent runtime and its state of the art performance via several analyses first we compare spici to nine previous network clustering_algorithms on a test_set of five existing biological_networks spici is more than times_faster than the previous_approaches on the networks for which the approaches terminate within h on a standard desktop machine moreover it is the only algorithm of those tested that is able to cluster all the networks within a reasonable amount of time second we show that even though spici is much faster than previous clustering_approaches the clusters it uncovers in biological_networks recapitulate functional_modules just as well third we perform a robustness analysis on synthetic networks as described by brohee and van helden and show that spici has very good performance in recapitulating protein_complexes deteriorating only on extremely incomplete networks we also find spici to be robust to perturbations in dense functional_networks finally we use spici to cluster large context specific human networks and identify modules specific for single conditions because of the size and number of networks this type of analysis was made feasible only by utilizing our new fast clustering approach
