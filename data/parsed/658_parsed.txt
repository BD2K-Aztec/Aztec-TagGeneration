bandage interactive_visualization of de_novo genome_assemblies although de_novo graphs contain assembled_contigs nodes the connections between those contigs edges are difficult for users to access bandage a bioinformatics application for navigating de_novo graphs easily is a tool for visualizing assembly graphs with connections users can zoom in to specific areas of the graph and interact with it by moving nodes adding labels changing colors and extracting sequences blast_searches can be performed within the bandage graphical_user and the hits are displayed as highlights in the graph by displaying connections between contigs bandage presents new possibilities for analyzing de_novo assemblies that are not possible through investigation of contigs alone availability_and source_code are freely_available at https github com rrwick bandage bandage is implemented in c and supported on linux os x and windows a full feature list and screenshots are available at http rrwick github io bandage contact current de_novo genome_assemblers use graphs most typically a de_bruijn an ideal graph would contain one distinct path for each underlying sequence but complexities such as repeated_sequences usually prevent this instead assembly graphs contain branching structures where one node may lead into multiple others the longest sequences in the graph that can be determined unambiguously are saved as contigs which are often the final_result of de_novo however an assembly_graph contains more information because it also has connections between sequences it can therefore be advantageous to work with assembly graphs instead of contigs bandage facilitates interaction with de_bruijn made by de_novo assemblers such as velvet spades and trinity it displays the graph in a graphical_user gui using a simple comprehensible representation the program is interactive allowing users to zoom pan and manually move nodes to focus on areas of interest by visualizing both nodes and edges bandage gives users easy fast access to the connection information contained in assembly graphs this is particularly useful when the assembly contains many short contigsas is often the case when assembling short readsand empowers users to examine and assess their assembly graphs in greater detail than when viewing contigs alone
