phylogenetics advance_access phylometa a program for phylogenetic comparative_analyses with meta_analysis phylometa is an easy to use console program for integrating phylogenetic_information into meta_analysis it is designed to help ecologists evolutionary_biologists and conservation biologists analyze effect_size data extracted from published_studies in a comparative phylogenetic context this software estimates phylogenetic versions of all the traditional meta_analytical statistics used for pooling effect_sizes with weighted regressions evaluating the homogeneity of these effect_sizes performing moderator tests akin to anova style analyses and analyzing data with fixed_and phylometa is developed in c c and can be used via command_line in ms windows environments availability phylometa can be obtained freely as an executable on the web atthe statistics of meta_analysis consist of quantifying experimental outcomes with effect_sizes assigning a weight to each effect_size that is inversely proportional to its variance and then averaging these weighted effect_sizes to provide an overall synthesis of multiple published_studies ecologists and evolutionary_biologists rely heavily on these statistics to provide research summaries and to test_hypotheses on moderators of experimental outcomesoften pooling research from different taxa to achieve these goals however pooling effect_size data from multiple taxa can potentially bias the outcome of meta_analysis because of the non independence of effect_sizes due to the shared phylogenetic history of taxa phylometa fills a gap in the statistical_tools needed to assess and account for this form of non independence when performing a meta_analysis on ecological_research this software reports all the familiar statistics of metaanalysis e g pooled effect_sizes paired with confidence_intervals and homogeneity tests along with phylogenetic versions of these statistics as reported in my intention with this software is to overcome the current_limitations of widespread meta_analytical software such as metawin and the emerging metafor package in r these tools are unable to integrate the covariances necessary to account for phylogenetic correlations among effect_sizes from related taxa
