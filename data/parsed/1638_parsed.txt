gene_expression estimation of gfp_tagged rna_numbers from temporal fluorescence_intensity data motivation ms gfp tagging of rna is currently the only method to measure intervals between consecutive transcription events in live cells for this new transcripts must be accurately_detected from intensity time traces results we present a novel method for automatically estimating rna_numbers and production intervals from temporal data of cell fluores cence intensities that reduces uncertainty by exploiting temporal_information we also derive a robust variant more resistant to outliers caused e g by rnas moving out of focus using monte_carlo we show that the quantification of rna_numbers and production intervals is generally improved compared with previous methods finally we analyze data from live escherichia_coli and show statistically_significant differences to previous methods the new methods can be used to quantify numbers and production intervals of any fluorescent_probes which are present in low copy_numbers are brighter than the cell background and degrade slowly availability source_code is available under mozilla public license attranscription translation and degradation of rna and proteins are stochastic processes their stochasticity results in phenotypic_variability in monoclonal cell_populations and temporal phenotypic changes in cells as such to better understand phenotypic diversity the mechanisms_regulating rna and protein numbers must be understood presently the only technique for quantifying rna_numbers and transcription dynamics in live escherichia_coli cells over time consists of tagging target rna_molecules with an array of fluorescent ms gfp proteins using this technique the target_rna can be visualized as a bright spot see e g shortly after production this method allows studying transcription in the absence of several sources of stochasticity such as rna degradation or dilution by cell_division the quantification of transcription dynamics from fluorescence microscopy_images requires estimation of the rna_numbers or the rna production times using statistics extracted from microscopy_images such as temporal intensity signals some methods have been proposed for determining rna_numbers using cell and or fluorescence spot intensities either using manually assisted or automatic techniques however these methods were designed to extract stationary rna distributions from cell_populations and as such they neglect any temporal_information in the data recently we introduced a method to use such information to extract time intervals between consecutive rna productions in individual cells this method uses a piecewise_constant monotonic least_squares lsq fit with an f test to select the model order after which a jump in the model curve is taken to correspond to the production of a target_rna unfortunately this method does not extract the absolute rna_numbers here we propose a new method for automatic quantification of rna_numbers and rna production intervals from intensity time series extracted from cells specifically we consider two variants one that uses lsq costs which can be derived using the central_limit and one that uses least deviations ld costs which is a robust variant of the former in particular the latter was designed to counter outliers commonly observed in the intensity data caused by e g rna_molecules moving out of the focal_plane at the cost of reduced accuracy the new method was designed to exploit the temporal_information in the data for improved accuracy to not require post and or pre_processing for time interval extraction and to be free of any regularization in temporal domain to allow more accurate quantification of time intervals first we present monte_carlo to demonstrate that the accuracy of the method is in general superior to the existing_methods in estimating both rna_numbers and rna production intervals second we apply our method and the previous methods on novel data extracted from time lapse microscopy measurements of live e coli cells_expressing ms gfp and rna target to show that for large number of cells statistically_significant differences in the results can be detected between the new and previous methods in both rna_numbers and rna production time intervals to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup comwe have presented two variants of a novel more accurate method for the automatic quantification of rna_numbers and rna production intervals from intensity time series extracted from images of live cells_expressing fluorescently_tagged rna_molecules the new method exploits the temporal_information in the data for improved accuracy does not require post and or pre_processing for time interval extraction and has no regularization in the temporal domain one of the proposed variants uses lsq costs which can be derived using the central_limit the other uses ld costs which is a robust variant of the former and is to be used when there is potential for outliers e g spots transiently leaving the focal_plane of the microscope meanwhile the former is preferred when no such corruption is present e g if using multiple slices along the z axis at each time point we used monte_carlo to demonstrate that the accuracy of the new methods is in general superior to that of our two previously_proposed methods both in estimating the rna_numbers and the rna production intervals we also applied the new and the previous methods on novel data from time lapse images of live e coli cells_expressing rna target for ms gfp to show that if the data contains large number of cells statistically_significant differences in the results can be detected in both the rna_numbers and rna production time intervals in this regard it should be noted that such large_numbers of cells are required to e g compare changes in the dynamics of rna production by a promoter when under different temperatures or levels of induction currently ms gfp tagging of rna_molecules is the only existing method for detecting rna_molecules as they are produced in live cells an accurate quantification of the copy_numbers of these tagged rna_molecules and determination of the moments when they first appear are essential particularly in studies of the dynamics of transcription in live cells see e g such measurements are currently being used to assess for example the role of induction and repression mechanisms in regulating gene_expression dynamics or the effects of environmental_factors such as temperature on this dynamics however detection and quantification of individual tagged rna_molecules and thus our method are valuable to other endeavors as well for example recent uses of the counting of such molecules as they appear in cells include a study of the dynamics of small genetic_circuits and a study of errors in the partitioning of rna_molecules in cell_division the two variants of the method proposed here should prove valuable in increasing the accuracy of these as well as of other studies making use of fluorescent molecules provided that the fluorescent molecules exist in small numbers in each cell that their fluorescence is significantly above the background fluorescence and that they have a slow degradation_rate when compared with dilution caused by cell_division
