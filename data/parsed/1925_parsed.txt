genome_analysis games identifies and annotates mutations in next_generation projects motivation next_generation ngs methods have the potential for changing the landscape of biomedical_science but at the same time pose several problems in analysis and interpretation currently there are many commercial and public software_packages that analyze ngs_data however the limitations of these applications include output which is insufficiently annotated and of difficult functional comprehension to end_users results we developed games genomic analysis of mutations extracted by sequencing a pipeline aiming to serve as an efficient middleman between data deluge and investigators games attains multiple levels of filtering and annotation such as aligning the reads to a reference_genome performing quality_control and mutational_analysis integrating results with genome_annotations and sorting each mismatch deletion according to a range of parameters variations are matched to known polymorphisms the prediction of functional mutations is achieved by using different approaches overall games enables an effective complexity reduction in large_scale dna sequencing_projects next_generation ngs or deep_sequencing methods are rapidly_changing the standards in genomics consolidated instruments such as illumina_genome illumina inc san_diego ca usa and abi solid applied_biosystems foster city ca usa can sequence a full human_genome in previously unimagined speed to date ngs has been applied in various contexts including whole_genome discovery of transcription_factor and non coding rna expression_profiles massively_parallel dna_sequencing combined with sequence capture methodologies targeted re sequencing have obvious potential in clinical_diagnostics particularly for to whom correspondence should be addressed complex_disorders that may be caused by a combination of several genes a major_goal of these studies is the detection of single_nucleotide snps insertions_and indels and other rearrangements to identify disease associated variants in clinical samples these genetic_determinants contribute to variation in phenotypes risk to diseases and response to drugs or to the environment different studies such as genomes_project and the cancer_genome http cancergenome nih gov have implemented massive sequencing to more efficiently catalog genetic_mutations responsible for cancer and other diseases therefore ngs provides important knowledge about genetic_variants in the population and about those genetic_variants that are being commonly used in diagnostic studies in clinical_settings on one hand ngs provides unprecedented_opportunities for high_throughput genetic research alternatively it poses problems in rationale data analysis and requires adequate computational strategies to organize handle and interpret the results in the past_few tools for the analysis of short long_reads datasets have become available currently the scientific_community has access to many commercial and open_source software_packages for analyzing ngs_data clc genomics workbench software clc bio aarhus denmark and nextgene softgenetics state college pa are among the most popular in the commercial domain furthermore there are open_source packages such as maq shrimp pass bwa samtools bfast perm snvmix crossbow and atlas snp for genome_project pilot_data bioinformatic_analysis researchers used mosaik http bioinformatics bc edu marthlab mosaik maq coronalite applied_biosystems foster city ca usa and ssaha as aligners and used genome_analysis gatk genotyper polyscan and polybayes for snp_detection these tools process data from various platforms using different algorithms such as bayesian approaches and snp_detection procedures however their output often seems to be insufficiently annotated to the detriment of clinical_implications and or of difficult functional_interpretation to solve this problem wewe have developed and validated games a new application for the processing and the annotation of ngs_data games generates concise and highly readable reports for a functional selection of important genetic_events games is a flexible tool it can be used for the analysis of data from different ngs_platforms it supports short and long single_end and paired_end in fact games uses as input the alignment file in the standard generic sam format which is obtainable from many free and commercial alignment tools the specificity and the accuracy of this application are warranted by the use of a range of independent filters which are geared toward the selection of statistically and functionally_significant genetic_events the investigator can easily and promptly use games reports to discriminate silent mutations or polymorphisms from variants that are potentially associated with a phenotype or a disease moreover by using bed and maf files as tracks in ucsc_genome or other viewers it is possible to swiftly identify mutations in different samples or individuals and to interrogate their biological_relevance sift and polyphen outputs can be used to predict the effect of the mutations in proteins in conclusion games is not only a new application for mining functional snps or indels from ngs_data but it also aids in the overall interpretation of large_scale sequencing_data games primary purpose is to provide a tool for life_science investigators who do not have bioinformatic expertise to obtain biological_insight into genetic_events
