the spatiotemporal order of signaling_events unveils the logic of development signaling motivation animals from worms and insects to birds and mammals show distinct body plans however the embryonic_development of diverse body plans with tissues and organs within is controlled by a surprisingly few signaling_pathways it is well recognized that combinatorial use of and dynamic interactions among signaling_pathways follow specific logic to control complex and accurate developmental signaling and patterning but it remains_elusive what such logic is or even what it looks like results we have developed a computational_model for drosophila eye_development with innovated methods to reveal how interactions among multiple pathways control the dynamically generated hexagonal array of r cells we obtained two novel findings first the coupling between the long_range in ductive signals produced by the proneural hh_signaling and the short range restrictive signals produced by the antineural notch and egfr_signaling is essential for generating accurately spaced r s second the spatiotemporal orders of key signaling_events reveal a robust pattern of lateral_inhibition conducted by ato coordinated notch and egfr_signaling to collectively determine r patterning this pattern stipulating the orders of signaling and comparable to the protocols of communication may help decipher the well appreciated but poorly_defined logic of developmental signaling availability_and the model is available upon request in developing cells cascades of signaling_events are believed to follow specific logic to make several evolutionarily_conserved signaling_pathways control the patterning of numerous phenotypically distinct body plans at the genomic_level the dna_sequence encodes rich logic that accurately determines the conditions each gene is turned on and off above this level it is argued that the heart of the matter developmental signaling is not so much the individual_molecules involved but more the flow of information and the logic of the system they participate in but this logic has never been clearly defined such logic is essential for ultimately deciphering morphogenesis and morphological evolution integrating protein_protein into complicated maps simply makes dynamic signaling deceptively complex without revealing spatiotemporal information of interactions many researchers build models and compute molecular concentrations and upon which infer signaling_events and their spatiotemporal orders in cells but such inference is difficult error_prone and inaccurate in nature especially when crosstalk occurs dynamically among pathways in rapidly patterning cells drosophila eye_development controlled by signaling among equipotential cells and producing a striking cellular pattern has been used to uncover the logic of developmental signaling the patterning of about hexagonally arrayed photoreceptor r cells is the first step of eye_development controlled by signaling among proneural genes antineural genes and conserved signaling_pathways these genes and pathways together form multiple spatiotemporally closed feedbacks controlling the accurate and moving process of r patterning despite intensive studies of these proneural genes antineural genes and hh notch egfr dpp wnt pathways in r patterning in the past three decades excellently reviewed in the quantitative and dynamic picture of the selfsustained signaling that drives the morphogenetic furrow mf movement and r patterning remains absent intensive crosstalk among these genes and pathways makes_it to unveil the picture experimentally instead to integrate experimental_findings into a computational_model to examine how the fine_grained and accurate organogenesis is performed is valuable for unfolding the spatiotemporally orchestrated signaling_process recently lubensky et_al developed a concise model containing four equations to simulate the striped pattern of r specification upon which they suggested that the dynamics of positive induction play_a in the selection of certain cells as r s and that r s are defined before the appearance of the complete group of proneural cells their results are quite different from what experimental_studies revealed and no signaling_events in r patterning were examined in fact in conventional computational studies the logic of signaling has never been explicitly defined and addressed here we describe a model consisting of the master proneural gene ato abbreviations of genes are in supplementary table s and key components ligands receptors and effectors in the hh egfr notch and dpp pathways the model combines the differential_equation formulation and the handling of signaling_events aiming to define and decipher the logic of developmental signaling that controls r patterning in particular and other morphogenetic events in general we obtained two novel findings first the coupling between the long_range inductive signals produced by the proneural hh_signaling and the short range restrictive signals produced by the antineural notch and egfr_signaling is essential for generating accurately spaced r s second the spatiotemporal orders of key signaling_events reveal a robust pattern of lateral_inhibition conducted by ato coordinated notch and egfr_signaling to collectively determine r patterning these findings unreported before help unveil the logic of developmental signaling and may make computational and even experimental researchers further examine the order and disorder of cell_signaling
