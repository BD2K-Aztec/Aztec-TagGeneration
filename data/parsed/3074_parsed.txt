molecular_signatures based prediction of enzyme promiscuity motivation enzyme promiscuity a property with practical_applications in biotechnology and synthetic_biology has been related to the evolvability of enzymes at the molecular level several structural mechanisms have been linked to enzyme promiscuity in enzyme families however it is at present unclear to what extent these observations can be generalized here we introduce for the first time a method for predicting catalytic and substrate promiscuity using a graph_based representation known as molecular_signature results our method which has an accuracy of for the non redundant kegg_database is also a powerful_analytical for characterizing structural determinants of protein promiscuity namely we found that signatures with higher contribution to the prediction of promiscuity are uniformly_distributed in the protein_structure of promiscuous enzymes in contrast those signatures that act as promiscuity determinants are significantly depleted around non promiscuous catalytic_sites in addition we present the study of the enolase and aminotransferase superfamilies as illustrative_examples of characterization of promiscuous enzymes within a superfamily and achievement of enzyme promiscuity by protein reverse_engineering recognizing the role of enzyme promiscuity in the process of natural_evolution of enzymatic_function can provide useful hints in the design of directed_evolution experiments we have developed a method with potential applications in the guided discovery and enhancement of latent catalytic capabilities surviving in modern enzymes beyond the classical definition of enzyme as specific to the substrate and reaction that catalyzes enzymes can show the capability of promiscuity i e to catalyze more than one reaction catalytic promiscuity or show broad_substrate substrate promiscuity enzyme promiscuity has drawn considerable attention in recent_years due to its evolutionary and practical_implications in fact to whom correspondence should be addressed enzyme promiscuity has been related to the evolvability of proteins as a mechanism that can be traced in the divergence of enzyme families and superfamilies namely the conservation of structural and catalytic features observed in enzyme superfamilies such as tautomerases enolases and many others suggests that enzyme specialization arose via divergent_evolution gene_duplication and subsequent mutations driven by environmental selective_pressure from promiscuous precursor enzymes inspired on this mechanism of natural_evolution enzyme promiscuity has been sought in the laboratory as a starting place for directed_evolution of enzymes capable of new functions such as in biocatalysis degradation of novel synthetic chemicals or in other innovative_ways in the context of synthetic_biology these potential applications of enzyme promiscuity in biotechnology have motivated the search of protein_engineering methods adding or enhancing latent catalytic_activities in existing enzymes such as site_directed and directed_evolution at the molecular level several structural mechanisms have been related to enzyme promiscuity for instance promiscuous binding has been observed in a large hydrophobic cleft or cavity or in a region with some other unusual structural_feature similarly promiscuity has been linked in some cases to intrinsically_disordered in the protein while in other studies it has been related to conserved_regions in the active_site a promiscuous active_site might be able to accommodate different substrates a feature that has been linked to protein_flexibility in particular to the mobility of active_site loops which appears to play_a in mediating promiscuity furthermore experiments have revealed that residues influencing enzyme promiscuity go beyond active residues contacting the substrate o in fact plasticity or neutral residues residues which are not essential for core catalytic_activity lying along the contour of the active_site may hasten divergence as it has been observed in several barrel superfamilies such as estareses and lipases enolases ribulose phosphate_binding as well as in directed_evolution of isomerases or aminotransferases nevertheless it is at present unclear to what extent these observations can be generalized to other enzyme families since additional determinants such as posttranslational_modifications the presence of multiple domains and oligomeric states may be also affecting enzyme promiscuity such as
