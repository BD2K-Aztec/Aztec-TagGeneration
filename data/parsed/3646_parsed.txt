predicting physiologically_relevant sh_domain mediated protein_protein in yeast motivation many intracellular signaling_processes are mediated by interactions involving peptide recognition modules such as sh_domains these domains bind to small linear protein sequence_motifs which can be identified using high_throughput experimental screens such as phage_display binding_motif patterns can then be used to computationally predict protein interactions mediated by these domains while many proteinprotein_interaction prediction_methods exist most do not work with peptide recognition module mediated_interactions or do not consider many of the known constraints governing physiologically_relevant interactions between two proteins results a novel method for predicting physiologically_relevant sh_domain peptide mediated proteinprotein_interactions in s cerevisae using phage_display data is presented like some previous similar methods this method uses position_weight models of protein linear motif preference for individual sh_domains to scan the proteome for potential hits and then filters these hits using a range of evidence sources related to sequence_based and cellular constraints on protein interactions the novelty of this approach is the large number of evidence sources used and the method of combination of sequence_based and protein pair based evidence sources by combining different peptide and protein features using multiple bayesian_models we are able to predict high_confidence interactions with an overall accuracy of availability_and domain motif mediated interaction prediction domo pred command_line and all relevant datasets are available under gnu lgpl_license for download from http www baderlab org software domo pred the domo pred command_line is implemented using python and c proteinprotein_interactions ppis are physical associations between protein pairs in a specific biological_context their knowledge provides important insights into the functioning of a cell previously experimental detection of ppis was limited to labor_intensive techniques such as co immunoprecipitation or affinity_chromatography though the detected ppis are largely accurate these techniques are difficult to apply to whole proteome_analysis this led to the development of various high_throughput ppi detection protocols such as mass_spectrometry combined with affinity_purification yeast twohybrid and next_generation to detect ppis at whole_genome level however genome_scale methods are also highly resource_intensive and single projects and techniques do not cover all known protein interactions further they only cover interactions in one organism at a time computational_approaches designed to predict reliable and novel ppis based on experimental interaction datasets have the advantages that they are inexpensive to apply to genomes including those that are v c the author published_by we developed a novel method for predicting physiologically_relevant ppis in yeast this method combines diverse binding_site peptide features including presence in a disordered region of the protein surface_accessibility conservation across different yeast_species and structural contact with the sh_domain as well as protein features such as cellular proximity shared biological_process similar molecular_function correlated gene_expression and sequence signature two separate bayesian_models are used to combine peptide and protein features their respective posterior_probabilities are further combined using bayes rule for predicting high_confidence interactions the combination of peptide and protein models achieved a higher accuracy of compared to individual models on a curated benchmark_dataset from disordered region and surface_accessibility data from the peptide feature_set and biological_process cellular_location and sequence signature information from the protein feature_set are able to separate positive from negative interactions significantly better than other features the method presented is generic and modular in nature given binding_peptide and feature data we expect it can be used to predict other prm mediated ppis in yeast and other organisms additional features such as network_topology protein expression and text_mining derived protein relationships can be added to our framework future development includes testing this method on other prms in different organisms especially human
