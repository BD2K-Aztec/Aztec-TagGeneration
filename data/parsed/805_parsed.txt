data_and bmrf net a software_tool for identification of protein interaction subnetworks by a bagging markov_random based method identification of protein interaction subnetworks is an important step to help us understand complex molecular_mechanisms in cancer in this paper we develop a bmrf net package implemented_in and c to identify protein interaction subnetworks based on a bagging markov_random bmrf framework by integrating gene_expression data and proteinprotein_interaction data this software_tool can be used to identify biologically_meaningful subnetworks a user_friendly graphic_user is developed as a cytoscape_plugin for the bmrf net software to deal with the input_output interface the detailed_structure of the identified networks can be visualized in cytoscape conveniently the bmrf net package has been applied to breast_cancer data to identify significant subnetworks related to breast cancer_recurrence availability_and the bmrf net package is available at http sourceforge net pro jects bmrfcjava the package is tested under ubuntu bit java glibc and cytoscape biological_systems can be represented as networks of multifunctional elements and modules the interactions among elements and modules can make it difficult to elucidate biological_behavior using any single type analytical_approach data_integration across multiple sources is required to solve the problem in different aspects and levels network based analysis becomes an important tool in revealing the underlying modular_structure of the signaling driving complex_diseases such as cancer several methods have been proposed to identify protein interaction subnetworks by integrating high_dimensional gene_expression data with protein_protein ppi data however these methods treat proteins genes in a network independently which leaves less differentially_expressed hub_genes likely unidentified recently a bagging markov_random bmrf based method namely bmrf have been proposed to identify protein_interaction by modeling the gene dependency in a network explicitly here we describe a bmrf net software_package that implements the bmrf algorithm an integrated network_analysis of gene_expression data and ppi data the package provides an effective_implementation that reduces the execution time of analyzinglarge scale biomedical data and makes visualization of ppi subnetworks immediately accessible to users a user_friendly graphic_user gui is developed as a java cytoscape_plugin to support ease of use for biomedical_researchers in the field of cancer research to handle high_dimensional the opensource software_package accelerates the analysis by enabling parallel_computing on multi core machines in laboratories or at large computing centers in addition to providing the statistical_information of the identified networks the detailed_structure of the identified subnetworks can be viewed in cytoscape the core analytic or computing program is implemented in c in the linux environment with a simple interface that can be run without the gui to evaluate performance we applied the bmrf net software_package to breast_cancer data for subnetwork identification the identified subnetworks show a significant_enrichment in cancer related signaling_pathways bmrf net is a computational_tool to identify biologically_meaningful subnetworks from ppi_networks with its user_friendly gui and concurrency options enabled in the core program the bmrf net package can be effectively used to analyze large_scale genomic_data for subnetwork identification
