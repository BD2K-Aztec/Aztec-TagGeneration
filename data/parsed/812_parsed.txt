borrowing strength a likelihood_ratio for related sparse signals motivation cancer_biology is a field where the complexity of the phenomena battles against the availability of data often only a few observations per signal source i e genes are available such scenarios are becoming increasingly more relevant as modern sensing technologies generally have no trouble in measuring lots of channels but where the number of subjects such as patients or samples is limited in statistics this problem falls under the heading large p small n moreover in such situations the use of asymptotic analytical results should generally be mistrusted results we consider two cancer datasets with the aim to mine the activity of functional_groups of genes we propose a hierarchical_model with two layers in which the individual signals share a common variance_component a likelihood_ratio is defined for the difference between two collections of corresponding signals the small number of observations requires a careful_consideration of the bias of the statistic which is corrected through an explicit bartlett correction the test is validated on monte_carlo which show improved detection of differences compared with other methods in a leukaemia study and a cancerous fibroblast_cell we find that the method also works better in practice i e it gives a richer picture of the underlying biology in this article we develop a likelihood_ratio lr test that aims to detect small concordant changes in a collection of related signals under two experimental_conditions under certain conditions it can be shown that the lr test is the most powerful test in many practical testing problems and potentially offers deeper insight into complex phenomena e g the biological_processes underlying cancer development exact calculation however is not always easy previous work used lr tests for evaluating changes in a single signal in the area of microarray_analysis our approach here differs from theirs by considering multiple concordant changes suggested to use hotellings t statistic for this purpose but this is only a viable alternative when the number of observations exceeds the number of channels this is to whom correspondence should be addressed in many modern genomic applications not the case alternatives are ancova approaches but compared with the hotelling t test they lose some power for correlated channels our approach is further motivated by recent work that developed a global gene_expression estimation method for testing association with clinical_outcome although that test either makes asymptotic assumptions for calculating significance which may be too liberal or uses permutation which may not be optimal the test we propose takes_into the magnitude and uncertainty of the changes in the field of microarray_analyses two stage methods have been proposed that look for over represented functional_classes e g as defined by gene_ontology go among differentially_expressed although these methods are very powerful and simple they tend to look at clearly differentially_expressed among which patterns are to be found these methods are exploratory in nature and often require an arbitrary cutoff for the second stage analyses our method is more a higher_level exploratory method which is more sensitive to concordant small changes and does not require arbitrary dichotomies this section applies the method both to simulated_and it is important to note that the computational performance of the method does not deteriorate with larger number of observations or channels in fact the numerical maximization described in section converges slower with a small number of channels since the optimum is more likely obtained for a degenerate channel variance which is computationally more expensive
