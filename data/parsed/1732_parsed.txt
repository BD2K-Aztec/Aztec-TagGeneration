structural_bioinformatics falcon home a high_throughput protein_structure server based on remote homologue recognition the protein_structure prediction_approaches can be categorized into template_based including homology_modeling and threading and free modeling however the existing threading tools perform poorly on remote homologous_proteins thus improving fold_recognition for remote homologous_proteins remains a challenge besides the proteome_wide structure_prediction poses another challenge of increasing prediction throughput in this study we presented falcon home as a protein_structure server focusing on remote homologue identification the design of falcon home is based on the observation that a structural template especially for remote homologous_proteins consists of conserved_regions interweaved with highly variable_regions the highly variable_regions lead to vague alignments in threading approaches thus falcon home first extracts conserved_regions from each template and then aligns a query_protein with conserved_regions only rather than the full_length template directly this helps avoid the vague alignments rooted in highly variable_regions improving remote homologue identification we implemented falcon home using the berkeley open infrastructure of network computing boinc volunteer computing protocol with computation power donated from over volunteer cpus falcon home shows a throughput as high as processing of over proteins per day in the critical assessment of protein_structure casp the falcon home_based prediction was ranked the th in the template_based category as an application the structures of mouse mitochondria proteins were predicted which revealed the significant correlation between protein half_lives and protein structural_factors availability_and falcon home is freely_available protein ict ac cn falcon the protein_structure prediction_problem is concerned with the prediction of three_dimensional structure of a protein from its primary sequence of residues based on whether homologous templates exist for the query_protein the prediction_approaches can be categorized into template_based tbm including homology_modeling and threading and free modeling fm specifically a threading approach recognizes the most likely fold of the query_protein and reports its alignments to known structural templates as output this strategy has been relatively successful for various proteins however the existing threading approaches have performed_poorly for remote homologous_proteins thus improving the fold_recognition for remote homologous_proteins remains a challenge to protein_structure in addition currently available prediction servers such as rosetta i tasser and raptorx are far from meeting the needs of high_throughput structure_prediction from the community more servers supporting proteomewide structure_prediction are in high_demand in general the sequences of remote homologous_proteins show a relatively weak signal of native structures however this does not indicate a lack of sequence_conservation features for structure in fact during the evolutionary_process of homologous_proteins some regions are conserved while some regions are relatively variable in term of structure and sequence the conserved_regions are known as common structural frameworks that are shared by homologous_proteins note thatsuccessfully utilized the concept of conserved_region in the design of raptor this observation is also supported by the success of multiple_templates threading strategy thus based on this observation we have proposed a novel threading approach to improving remote homologue identification and further developed a high_throughput protein_structure server called falcon home
