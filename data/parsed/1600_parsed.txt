epi peptide designer a tool for designing peptide ligand libraries based on epitope paratope interactions motivation antibodies are an important class of biological drugs but with limitations such as inadequate pharmacokinetics adverse immunogenicity and high production_costs synthetic pep tides for the desired target represent an important alternative to antibodies however no computational_tool exists to guide the design of these peptides results to identify the interacting residues in a given antibodyantigen abag interface we used interface interacting residue i r a selection method based on computed molecular_interactions the aggregation of all the molecular_interactions between epitope and paratope residues allowed us to transform the d abag complex structures into interface graphs based on these data and the probability of molecular_interaction we developed epi peptide designer tool that uses predicted paratope residues for an epitope of interest to generate targeted peptide ligand libraries epi peptide designer successfully predicted peptides able to bind to lid target protein of the experimentally tested peptides an enrichment of compared to randomly_generated peptides this tool should enable the development of a new generation of synthetic interacting peptides that could be very useful in the biosensor diagnostic and therapeutic fields availability_and all software developed in this work are available atproteinprotein interactions are at the heart of biological_processes and protein functions are highly related to their binding_properties for instance the immune_response relies on antigen_recognition by a specific_antibody and the antibodyantigen abag complex represents a specific type of proteinprotein_interaction characterized by high_affinity and specificity identifying the key_residues and interaction_patterns on the abag interface could help improving antibody humanization as well as the design of new antibodies and peptide ligands based on the antibody properties the use of peptides for therapeutic purpose instead of antibodies has plenty of advantages such as lower manufacturing costs less immunogenic profile greater stability and better organ tumor penetration several chemical approaches have been generated to overcome therapeutic peptides limitations such as low oral_bioavailability and v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com biodistribution indeed much research_effort is focused on the use of peptide ligands as a viable alternative to antibodies in targeted_therapies for instance mimetic peptides derived from the anti her erbb antibody can inhibit the tyrosine_kinase of this receptor and consequently impair tumour_growth presently over peptide drugs are approved for clinical use to guide the design and increase the affinity and specificity of these peptide drugs different tools based on various methodologies e g directed_evolution high_throughput protein screening or rational_design based on proteinpeptide interactions have emerged in silico rational_design of peptides based on molecular_interactions is also a fundamental proof_of for the current understanding of the physical_chemical basis of molecular_recognition moreover this approach could become a powerful complement to the current librarybased screening methods because it allows targeting specific patches on the surface of a protein computational_design also gives the opportunity to program proteinprotein_interactions for specific applications however currently no computational methodology to design this kind of peptides is available in this work we propose a computational_method to generate libraries of peptide ligands or paratope mimetics based on the epitopeparatope interaction epi patterns and on a target epitope input_sequence this software called epi peptide designer uses a set of abag complex structures from the protein_data pdb and the blue star sting server and sting db containing hundreds of interaction descriptors reported in residue by residue fashion to compute the bayesian probabilities of molecular_interactions between epitope and paratope epipeptide designer generates peptide binder sequences based on the epitope sequence entered by the user and the patterns extracted from the abag interfaces the method was experimentally_validated using as target a dermonecrotic protein lid from the brown spider venom we have synthesized a library of peptides and of them were able to bind to lid in addition random peptide were designed in which of them were positives these results indicate an enrichement of in ligand peptides designed using epi peptide desginer this is to our knowledge the first generator of peptide ligand libraries based on epitopeparatope interface
