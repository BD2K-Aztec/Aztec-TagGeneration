analysis of cfse time series data using division age and label structured population models_motivation in vitro and in vivo cell_proliferation is often studied using the dye carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester cfse the cfse time series data provide information about the proliferation history of populations of cells while the experimental_procedures are well established and widely used the analysis of cfse time series data is still challenging many available analysis tools do not account for cell age and employ optimization_methods that are inefficient or even unreliable results we present a new model based analysis method for cfse time series data this method uses a flexible description of proliferating cell_populations namely a division age and label structured population model efficient maximum_likelihood and bayesian_estimation algorithms are introduced to infer the model_parameters and their uncertainties these methods exploit the forward sensitivity equations of the underlying partial_differential model for efficient and accurate gradient calculation thereby improving computational_efficiency and reliability compared with alternative_approaches and accelerating uncertainty analysis the performance of the method is assessed by studying a dataset for immune cell_proliferation this revealed the importance of different factors on the proliferation rates of individual cells among others the predominate effect of cell age on the division rate is found which was not revealed by available computational_methods availability_and the matlab_source implementing the models and algorithms is available fromproliferation is essential in many biological_processes ranging from development to wound_healing immune_response and stem cell_renewal due to this eminent role a key challenge in cell_biology is to quantify proliferation dynamics nowadays there are different experimental methods available to assess cell_proliferation e g time lapse microscopy and proliferation assays based upon carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester cfse labeling while time lapse microscopy is highly informative it is difficult to apply in vivo cfse based proliferation assays can be employed in vivo and in vitro but the data analysis is more intricate and no single_cell time courses are available to study proliferation using cfse cells are incubated with carboxyfluorescein_diacetate succinimidyl ester cfda se cfda se can diffuse across the cell_membrane and once in the cytoplasm is converted to cfse which binds covalently to intracellular_proteins v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com cfse is a fluorescent_dye and its concentration is reduced by protein_degradation as well as cell_division during cell_division cfse is distributed approximately equally among daughter_cells hence proliferation results in a progressive dilution of the dye which can be recorded using flow_cytometry as the individual cells do not in general divide with the same rates an initially unimodal distribution becomes multi_modal as time progresses the modes are related to different numbers of cell_divisions however often the cells with different numbers of divisions are not strictly separated for this reason the calculation of the number of cells with a certain division number using peak_detection and deconvolution methods is error_prone furthermore even knowledge about the number of cells with a particular division number does not enable the comparison of different hypotheses regarding e g the proliferation rates the need for quantitative data analysis and hypothesis_testing inspired the development of a multitude of model based_approaches nowadays age structured population asp models division structured population dsp models label structured population lsp models age and division structured population adsp models and division and label structured population dlsp models are used to study cfse data these classes of population balance models account for up to two properties of individual cells bullet number of divisions i dsp and dlsp model bullet cfse concentration x lsp and dlsp model bullet cells age a asp and adsp model and are mostly written as systems of ordinary_differential odes or partial_differential pdes population balance models which account for the cell agethe time passed since cell_division i e asp and adsp can also be formulated as sets of nested integrals de this alternative formulation is employed for the smithmartin model and the cyton model for the smithmartin model and cyton model with progression fraction equal to zero equivalent pde formulations are available for a comprehensive introduction to structured population models we refer to the review by de boer and perelson as the population models available in the literature did not capture the complexity of the process we recently_introduced the division age and label structured population dalsp model the dalsp model a system of coupled pdes provides a flexible description of proliferation dynamics but it has never been used to analyse cfse data accordingly no parameter_estimation model_selection and uncertainty analysis methods have been available for this type of model until now in this manuscript we introduce methods to infer the parameters of dalsp models from cfse distribution time series data and to assess the dependency of the proliferation rates on factors such as cell age for this we introduce a statistical_model linking predictions of the dalsp model to measure cfse data and formulate the corresponding inverse_problem as the optimization_problem is nonlinear we compare different optimization procedures furthermore we implement the first identifiability and uncertainty analysis methods for dalsp models combined with model_selection methods these methods facilitate an in depth analysis of cfse time series data which we illustrate for a published dataset we illustrate the proposed model based quantification_method by studying t lymphocyte_proliferation t lymphocytes are part of the adaptive_immune and their pool expands upon pathogen recognition this expansion is frequently monitored using cfse labeling in vivo and in vitro proliferation assays using cfse require accurate tools for quantifying biologically_meaningful parameters to meet this requirement we propose to use dalsp models which account for the age of individual cells in contrast to the frequently used lsp and dlsp models dalsp models allow for non exponential inter division time to exploit dalsp models for the analysis of cfse time series data we derived sensitivity equations for gradient calculation and we developed a tailored numerical scheme exploiting the hierarchical_structure of dalsp models as an accurate model based analysis of experimental_data requires reliable inference we compared different optimization algorithms with respect to convergence and computation time our comparison which is to the best of our knowledge the first comparison of this kind for structured population models revealed that multi start local optimization outperforms stochastic global optimization for this class of pde models this confirms results byfor ode_models indeed for some dalsp models the evaluated stochastic global optimizers did not even converge if a large number of function evaluations was allowed for the same models multi start local optimization with accurate gradients provided reproducible results this underpined the importance of using sensitivity equations which have so_far not been described for lsp and dlsp models the latter raising questions regarding the reliability of previous estimation results the efficient deterministic optimizers were used to maximize a likelihood_function which accounts for the stochasticity of the acquisition process this likelihood_function is statistically more meaningful than least_squares type objective_functions we employed the proposed likelihood_function for model_selection and found evidence for a dependence of the division rate on the cell age more precisely the hill type division rate with a high degree n a indicated a lower_bound for the inter division time which could be interpreted as a minimal length of the cell_cycle this seems biologically more plausible than the time and cfse concentration dependent division rates proposed in previous publications furthermore age dependent rates of cell_division have been reported for similar biological_systems using time lapse microscopy data beyond model_selection we provided the first detailed bayesian uncertainty analysis for structured population models this was challenging due to the computational_complexity of pde models and the number of unknown_parameters we established computational feasibility by exploiting tailored numerical_methods and an initialization using optimization results the posterior samples obtained using mcmc methods revealed a low_level of uncertainties for latent properties such as the age distribution and the parameters of the cell_division rate in addition the marginal distribution of parameters are consistent with the profile likelihoods which substantiated the results further all the modeling simulation parameter_estimation and model_selection methods used in this publication are implemented in the open_source matlab toolbox shape dalsp the availability of the code will facilitate the application of the method and simplify the development of extensions e g toward multiple cell_types asymmetric_cell and alternative dalsp models in particular the implementation of a cyton based model would be interesting as these models allow for a fraction of non dividing_cells in addition to extensions alternative parameterizations can be included e g a parameterization of the probability_density for a cell to divide and die at age a as used in the cyton models in contrast to a parameterization of the age dependent rate of cell_division and cell_death the incorporation of the features in shape dalsp would allow for an even broader_spectrum of applications and improve user_friendliness in summary this study presents a novel model based analysis method for cfse time series data besides a statistical_model we present findings regarding optimizer performance and uncertainty analysis these findings and the methods we developed can be easily transferred to other structured population models and might also be applicable to other types of population balance models accordingly this study will help to make the most of cfse time series data and other data requiring cell_cycle corrections
