dissect detection and characterization of novel structural_alterations in transcribed sequences motivation computational_identification of genomic structural_variants via high_throughput is an important problem for which a number of highly sophisticated solutions have been recently_developed with the advent_of transcriptome_sequencing rna_seq the problem of identifying structural_alterations in the transcriptome is now attracting significant attention in this article we introduce two novel algorithmic formulations for identifying transcriptomic structural_variants through aligning transcripts to the reference_genome under the consideration of such variation the first formulation is based on a nucleotide level alignment model a second potentially faster formulation is based on chaining fragments shared between each transcript and the reference_genome based on these formulations we introduce a novel transcriptome to genome alignment_tool dissect discovery of structural alteration event containing transcripts which can identify and characterize transcriptomic events such as duplications inversions rearrangements and fusions dissect is suitable for whole transcriptome structural_variation discovery problems involving sufficiently long_reads or accurately assembled_contigs results we tested dissect on simulated transcripts altered via structural events as well as assembled rna_seq contigs from human_prostate c our results indicate that dissect has high_sensitivity in identifying structural alteration events in simulated transcripts as well as uncovering novel structural_alterations in cancer transcriptomes availability dissect is available for public use at http dissectthe transcriptome refers to the complete collection of rna_sequences transcribed from portions of the genome these include not only mrnas but also non_coding genomic structural_alterations involving transcribed regions of the genome will appear in the associated transcript sequences although the whole transcriptome is much smaller than the whole_genome in the context of structural_alterations rna_seq can be more difficult to analyze partially due to splicing which can produce several transcripts from the same gene in comparison to the wildtype transcripts post_transcriptional processes can also introduce structural_alterations into these sequences to analyze structural_variation within transcriptomic highthroughput_sequencing hts_data a k a rna_seq one typically needs to find the most likely transcript to genome alignment under the possibility of structural alteration events such as i internal duplications which result in two separate segments in the transcript_sequence aligning to the same segment of the genomic_sequence ii inversions which result in a segment of the transcript_sequence aligning to the opposite strand of the genome than the rest of the transcript in an inverted fashion iii rearrangements which result in a change of ordering of the aligned segments and iv fusions which result in the transcript_sequence aligning to two genes that are on two different chromosomes or far apart on the same chromosome note that an inversion can be of the type i suffixinversion or prefix inversion which involve a single breakpoint where a suffix of the transcript_sequence aligns to the strand opposite of that of the corresponding prefix and ii internal inversion which involves a pair of breakpoints where the portion of the inverted transcript_sequence aligns to the strand opposite to that of the flanking portions several studies have detected such transcriptomic structural_alterations in eukaryotic_species including mice rats and humans these structural_alterations are rarely observed in healthy human tissues and their normal roles have not been determined however specific instances of transcriptomic structural_alterations which can be a result of genomic_alterations or transcriptomic processing have been correlated with disease_states especially in cancer several high_throughput methods for detecting structural_alterations by analyzing mappings of rna_seq have been developed mostly focusing on fusions partially due to their abundance in cancer but also due to the relative_ease of identifying them computationally as hts technologies progress the length of the read sequences they produce grows dramatically and is expected to continue growing to over bp per read a longer read has a greater possibilityrepresent the transcript g and s represent two genomic_regions g is the complementary_strand for g boundaries between red and green blocks indicate event breakpoints arrows represent corresponding genomic transitions in the alignment apart from the event_types shown in the figure duplication_events can appear as non tandem and fusions can be between two different strands of containing segments from more than two exons complicating the process of mapping such a read existing structural alteration detection_tools are limited by their reliance on read_mapping tools designed for the short_read produced by the original hts technologies they cannot take advantage of increasing read_length furthermore the increase in read_length improves the accuracy of de_novo transcriptome_assembly tools leading to opportunities for the analysis of full transcript sequences we first report the performance of dissect on simulation datasets derived from ncbi refseq transcript sequences and known gene gene structure database which are subjected to nucleotide level substitution indel noise with varying frequencies novel oligonucleotide sequence insertions and structural_alterations at different length distributions including exon duplications inversions rearrangements and transcripttranscript fusions to demonstrate the performance of dissect on real human transcriptome_data we report on an rna_seq dataset comprising bp reads from the prostate_cancer cell_line c
