genome_analysis mauve assembly metrics high_throughput dna_sequencing have spurred the development of numerous novel methods for genome_assembly with few exceptions these algorithms are heuristic and require one or more parameters to be manually set by the user one approach to parameter_tuning involves assembling data from an organism with an available high_quality reference_genome and measuring assembly accuracy using some metrics we developed a system to measure assembly_quality under several scoring metrics and to compare assembly_quality across a variety of assemblers sequence_data types and parameter choices when used in conjunction with training data such as a high_quality reference_genome and sequence_reads from the same organism our program can be used to manually identify an optimal sequencing and assembly strategy for de_novo sequencing of related organisms availability gpl source_code and a usage tutorial is atgiven high_throughput sequencing_data most current genome_assemblers apply deterministic heuristics to infer the genome_sequence usually a variety of parameters can be used to control the heuristic for which the optimal_combination of values may not be obvious given a training_dataset consisting of highquality reference_genomes and sequence_reads generated from those genomes it may be possible to manually or automatically select a good set of assembly parameters a key requirement for this task is a means to quantify the accuracy of an assembly measuring the accuracy with which an assembly reconstructs the reference_genome presents another inference problem it is usually unknown which part of the inferred assembly corresponds to which part of the reference_genome we must somehow map parts of the assembly back onto the reference_genome through sequence_alignment which usually takes one of two forms local_alignment exemplified by algorithms like blast and whole_genome alignment with algorithms like mummer or mauve we introduce a new set of assembly accuracy metrics based on the progressivemauve genome aligner the assembly metrics we describe illustrate substantial differences between sequencing and assembly strategies for example the volc assembly captured nearly all coding_genes in the reference_genome but had a high scaffold count relative to the volcidba assembly striking an ideal balance between assembly error types rates and sequencing cost is an exercise left for users of our software when a finished reference_genome is available and has been resequenced the assembly metrics calculated by our system can be used to guide selection of sequencing strategy and tune assembly parameters the reported metrics may form the basis for a future automated system to perform supervised machine_learning of assembly parameters by conducting a parameter sweep over a large number of assembly strategies finally we note that genome alignment_algorithms are not perfect and some differences between the assembly and the reference may be due to alignment error and not true assembly errors funding national_science award er
