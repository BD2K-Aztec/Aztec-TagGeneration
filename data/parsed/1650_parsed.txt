evaluating the molecule based prediction of clinical drug_responses in cancer motivation molecule based prediction of drug response is one major task of precision oncology recently large_scale cancer genomic studies such as the cancer_genome tcga provide the opportunity to evaluate the predictive utility of molecular data for clinical drug_responses in multiple_cancer results here we first curated the drug treatment information from tcga four chemotherapeutic_drugs had more than clinical response records then we developed a computational framework to evaluate the molecule based_predictions of clinical responses of the four drugs and to identify the corresponding molecular_signatures results show that mrna or mirna expressions can predict drug_responses significantly better than random classifiers in specific cancer_types a few signature genes are involved in drug response related pathways such as ddb in dna_repair pathway and dll in notch_signaling finally we applied the framework to predict responses across multiple_cancer and found that the prediction performances get improved for cisplatin based on mirna expressions integrative_analysis of clinical drug response data and molecular data offers opportunities for discovering predictive_markers in cancer this study provides a starting_point to objectively evaluate the molecule based_predictions of clinical drug_responses molecular polymorphisms and alterations play_important in heterogeneous anti_cancer responses the relationships between molecular_features and clinical drug_responses lay the foundation for optimizing drug_therapies based on a patients genomic_context for example metastatic breast_tumors with her overexpression are sensitive to trastuzumab egfr_mutations in non_small predict response to gefitinib with the fast development and reduced_costs of high_throughput more efforts are made to identify genomic markers that can predict drug_responses as precision_medicine takes_into the genomic variability of individuals in oncology practice accurately predicting response to cancer drugs based on molecules becomes a critical issue cancer_cell have been used to find gene_expression which can predict in vitro drug sensitivities however whether cell_lines can capture the complex molecular_alterations in real cancer patients is still in debate a few large_scale cancer genome_projects such as the cancer_genome tcga not only provide diverse molecular data but also clinical information of cancer patients by now tcga has comprehensively characterized tens of cancer_types via the multi_dimensional analysis of gene_mutation copy_number dna_methylation mrna mirna and protein expression http cancergenome nih gov tcga has also expanded the knowledge about genomic similarities among multiple cancer lineages via v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com the pan cancer studies its molecular data promotes the development of oncology practices such as targeted_therapeutics and prognosis prediction however the predictive utility of the diverse molecular data for clinical drug_responses has not been explored in this study we aim at evaluating the utility of molecular data for predicting clinical drug_responses in cancer based on tcga data first of all we carefully curated the clinical data of drug_treatments from tcga extracted drugs and patients with drug response records and then focused on four drugs cisplatin paclitaxel carboplatin and fluorouracil with relatively more clinical response records then we constructed a computational framework to evaluate the performances of the molecule based prediction of clinical drug_responses using copy_number cnas dna methylations mirna expressions and mrna_expressions compared to random classifiers expression data shows significantly better performances on cisplatin or paclitaxel in specific cancer_types also we found that some signature genes are involved in important_cellular known to mediate drug_responses such as ddb in dna_repair pathway and dll in notch_signaling in the following multiple cancer analysis it was found that mirna expressions exhibit good predictive performances across cancer_types and the classifier fitted to multiple cancer data can improve the predictions on certain single cancer_types our work offers the opportunity to study diverse molecular_features of clinical drug_responses in primary_tumors it is a starting_point to objectively evaluate the molecule based_predictions of clinical anti_cancer responses predicting clinical drug_responses by molecular data in human cancer is one important goal of precision oncology in this study we carefully curated drug response records from tcga and evaluated the performances of diverse molecular data types on predicting the clinical drug_responses in single cancer type analyses mrna and mirna expressions achieve significantly better performances in specific cancer_types than random classifiers many identified signature genes play_important in the cellular_processes known to mediate drug_resistance we also found that mirna expressions improve performances for predicting cisplatin responses based on multiplecancer type analysis on the contrary cnas and dna methylations show limited predictive capabilities either in single or multiple cancer type analyses overall the predictive performances of molecule based_classifiers are not so good although some of them performed significantly better than random classifiers the following problems may cause current_limitations first molecular patterns are highly complex due to the tumor_heterogeneity among patients the available datasets cannot represent the whole picture of molecular_alterations in cancer thus the classifiers trained on limited data could perform poorly on predicting new patients second the molecular_features far outnumber the patients many irrelevant features may be selected by accident although the sparse linear_model was used to reduce features and avoid model over fitting thirdly the non responders are usually much fewer we observed that the numbers of non responders are significantly correlated with the average aucs spearman rank correlation p value of the mrna datasets regardless of the drug cancer pairs the predictive utility of mrna_expressions has also been reported in cancer_cell according to a dream competition which aimed at identifying what methods and to what extent molecular data can predict in vitro drug sensitivities mrna_expressions are found to provide the best predictive_performance among all molecular data types it is also reported that protein mrna and mirna abundances provide the best performance when modelling the gi endpoint the identified signature genes and mirnas based on mrna or mirna_expression data can provide novel insights of the mechanisms of drug resistances ddb belongs to the cisplatin_resistance correlated nucleotide_excision which is regarded as potential_therapeutic dll down_regulation of which inhibited tumor_growth can be targeted by demcizumab a drug in phase_i other signature genes including ints hnrnpa and hnrnpa p also show prognostic power but the molecular_mechanisms are still unclear mir c a homolog of signature mir e and located in the same primary transcript regulates paclitaxel resistance in breast cancer_cells to our knowledge our work is the first study to investigate the predictive utility of the molecular data for clinical drug_responses from tcga also the curated pharmacogenomics data provides an important resource for future_studies
