databases_and star an integrated solution to management and visualization of sequencing_data easily visualization of complex data features is a necessary step to conduct studies on next_generation ngs_data we developed star an integrated web_application that enables online management visualization and track based analysis of ngs_data results star is a multilayer web_service system on the client side star leverages javascript html canvas and asynchronous communications to deliver a smoothly scrolling desktop like graphical_user with a suite of in browser analysis tools that range from providing simple track configuration controls to sophisticated feature_detection within datasets on the server side star supports private session state retention via an account management system and provides data management modules that enable collection visualization and analysis of third_party sequencing_data from the public_domain with over thousands of tracks hosted to date overall star represents a next generation data exploration solution to match the requirements of ngs_data enabling both intuitive visualization and dynamic analysis of data availability_and star browser system is freely_available on the web atusing genome_browser software to visualize sequence_data is often a productive first step to take when tasked with extracting biological meaning from experimental_results existing genomebrowsers fall mainly into two categories stand alone and internet_based stand alone programs such as seqminer cisgenome mapview eagleview ngsview magicviewer integrative_genomics and genomeview are installed locally and allow users to perform analysis and data visualization to the limit of their local machine users must ensure software remains up to date and are often required to download and reformat datasets for use with the application without a clear channel to share data with others in contrast internet_based browsers require no download installation or update typically delegate computational load to remote servers and store data centrally for all users to immediately browse some internet_based data exploration platforms such as cistrome and cistrome finder also provide visualization function other popular web_based browsers such as university of california santa_cruz ucsc_genome ucsc cancer_genomics browser and ensembl genome_browser provide the benefits of web_applications but suffer from continued reliance on first generation web_application technology such as postback and server side drawing making little use of the computational power of clients several publicly released genome_browsers such as the national_center ncbi epigenome viewer generic genome_browser gbrowse anno j jbrowse and the washu epigenome browser offer an enhanced user experience through the use of second generation web technologies such as advanced third_party javascript libraries asynchronous communications ajax restful architecture and client side rendering these browsers deliver a more desktop like user experience than their first generation counterparts and distribute computation more evenly between the server and the client thereby helping to reduce network loading although second generation browsers have significantly_enhanced the user experience they have room for improvement to whom correspondence should be addressed on some daily used functions the ncbi epigenome viewer allows smooth panning and zooming but does not support comparative_analysis between data tracks gbrowse and jbrowse do not provide registries of public data tracks for ready to use visualization and make use of statically generated server side images that limit client side interactivity the washu epigenome browser displays data tracks from the human epigenome atlas produced by the national_institutes nih roadmap epigenomics project and the encyclopedia of dna elements encode_project encode_project along with interactive_visualization and analysis functions such as correlation and statistics test but there is no sequencing_data analysis tool like peak_calling and it is not fully compatible to microsoft internet explorer and firefox web_browsers a feature lacking from all second generation browsers is the inclusion of sophisticated analysis tools as an integrated component we present star a next generation web_based application that aims to provide an integrated solution for both visualization and analysis of deep sequencing_data along with simple access to public datasets on the client side star features a next generation browser that is based on the anno j genome_browser modifying it extensively to add enhanced visualization options bug fixes improved cross browser compatibility dynamic access to an extensive collection of public datasets and a suite of in browser analysis tools such as correlation_analysis and peak_calling the browser features client side rendering via html canvas smooth navigation via asynchronous data transfer dynamic track state changes zoom scale resize via javascript cross domain data_retrieval and modular track development architecture on the server side star provides distributed mechanism to collect and process data from public data_sources user access control to protect private data data track management and data configuration management portable personal server setup and utilities for storage parsing and analysis of sequence_data the star system aims to provide an integrated solution to help researchers easily visualize and analyze sequencing_data toachieve good user experience fast data access and quick_response are crucial aspects such features are usually limited by network communications and computational load on servers for a traditional web_based genome_browser usually the web_server or application server retrieves data from a database and renders an html page to the client almost all the computing load is on the server side and heavy request traffic places heavy load on servers the star system distributes computation between the client and the server s graphical_representations of data are constructed purely on the client side and modifications to view state such as scaling or color do not require any form of server interaction thanks to the use of html canvas page refreshes are completely avoided through the use of ajax to provide a smoother browsing experience most modern w c compliant web_browsers are in the process of fully adopting the new html specification which includes the canvas element although most such as safari chrome opera and firefox already supported canvas many years_ago to provide compatibility with older versions of internet explorer googles explorercanvas plug in provides the required functionality when users zoom out to view a larger genomic_region more data must be retrieved from the data server which takes more time and disk_space to deal with this jbrowse provides a solution similar to google maps by pre generating small images at different zooming levels however because those images are generated on the server side it is usually difficult to provide a flexible way to interact with the data and change view mode rapidly when compared with the performance of star instead of generating static images star pre calculates the coverage of positions at each zooming level the server retrieves data from a pre_calculated database at each view resolution this significantly_reduces the data amount retrieved and the time for data_processing for the purpose of simplicity star uses the berkeley db bdb file system rather than a relational_database such as mysql to deposit sequencing_data this provides key features such as optimized indexing and caching to deposit and retrieve data from files using several customized languagespecific apis this design has a better performance than most relational databases and there is no need to run a large system to maintain the sequencing_data to reduce searching space the input_data are deposited into separate file databases in which each file contains all the data features for a specific chromosome combined with pre calculation file system database and cache technologies the data preparation is fast and provides almost constant access time regardless of the zooming level to reduce network transit time all data are compressed where supported by the client upon receipt and unpacking data parsing times in the browser are minimal due to the fact that javascript object notation json format is natively supported by javascript if custom data file is too large for network transferring star limits the maximum upload size up to gb or unpublished_data need to be kept private user would probably prefer to storing data in their own data server and this is supported by star this function is available in the ucsc_genome using indexed data_formats such as bam and bigwig to contain data features data_files are distributed on web accessible servers and queried via http to retrieve the portion that is needed for the chromosomal position that users are currently viewing in contrast star provides a high_efficiency c program fornote display settings refer to whether the user can adjust the display properties of the data track such as color and signal shape data scaling is how to normalize data to show readable and comparable signals between multiple tracks and locations n a the feature is not implemented or the information is not available data_processing and an in house common gateway interface cgi server program for processing data requests there are several advantages of this design first users do not need to install and configure a complicated web_server such as apache the star system handles data request using a simple program that is easy to install and launch second star uses a simple data_processing program to convert multiple input_formats to a uniform internal format which is easy for data_processing third it provides a better solution for data service_provision such as pre calculation and cache functions to improve system performance once the meta_information for each track is generated and submitted through the star upload page data are available for direct viewing and sharing with other users we compared the star browser system with several other web_based genome_browsers relative to other web enabled browsers star provides a large collection of sequencing_data tracks allowing users to visualize most public datasets in addition to the features that are available in many recently_developed genome_browsers such as rich visualization features and high interactivity star has implemented sophisticated in browser analysis tools such as peak_calling that are not yet available in other browsers the functionality of in browser analysis makes data analysis intuitive and straightforward which is particularly useful for users without much data analysis experience we are aware that there is still more room to improve the functionality and usability of the star system in the future we plan to further improve the user_friendly interface add more graphical features to the browser and include more annotation tracks to help researchers easily extract biological_information from sequence_data
