systems_biology bipace d graph_based multiple_alignment for comprehensive d gas_chromatography motivation comprehensive d gas_chromatography mass spec trometry is an established method for the analysis of complex_mixtures in analytical_chemistry and metabolomics it produces large_amounts of data that require semiautomatic but preferably automatic handling this involves the location of significant signals peaks and their matching and alignment across different measurements to date there exist only a few openly available algorithms for the retention time alignment of peaks originating from such experiments that scale well with increasing sample and peak numbers while providing reliable alignment results results we describe bipace d an automated algorithm for retention time alignment of peaks from d gas_chromatography experiments and evaluate it on three previously_published datasets against the mspa swpa and guineu algorithms we also provide a fourth dataset from an experiment studying the h production of two different strains of chlamydomonas_reinhardtii that is available from the metabolights database together with the experimental_protocol peak_detection results and manually_curated multiple peak alignment for future comparability with newly_developed algorithms availability_and bipace d is contained in the freely_available maltcms framework version hosted at http maltcms sf net under the terms of the l gpl v or eclipse open_source licenses the software used for the evaluation along with the underlying datasets is available at the same location the c reinhardtii dataset is freely_available atcomprehensive d gas_chromatography gc gc has developed into a de facto standard analytical_technique to resolve complex_mixtures of volatile chemical_compounds in various areas of research it is often used for the separation and characterization of petrol and gasoline mixtures it couples two chromatographic columns with possibly different characteristics to achieve an improved separation of complex_mixtures over one dimensional gas_chromatography however identification of analytes in gc gc with a one dimensional detector such as a flame_ionization is often limited to the use of retention_index calculations and can be improved by coupling a mass_spectrometer to the chromatograph gc gc_ms in the field of metabolomics which studies the multitude of organic_molecules produced modified and consumed by living_organisms metabolites both gc gc and gc gc_ms have been successfully used to characterize and quantify volatile metabolites in different organisms the variability of retention_times rts in both gc gc and gc gc_ms requires sophisticated algorithms for automatic alignment of corresponding analyte signals between different samples additionally the size and number of acquired sample data pose a significant challenge to automated methods and effectively prevent large_scale manual intervention by human_experts preprocessing of gc gc_ms data involves the filtering and noise_reduction of the raw signal the localization deconvolution integration and normalization of analyte signals of interest peaks as well as downstream matching of peaks to create a multiple_alignment of related signals from different samples then statistical_methods like analysis_of principal_components partial_least and variants thereof may be applied to compare samples for significant differences and similarities within and between experimental factor groups a more complete overview of current data_processing methods and programs for gc gc and gc gc_ms data may be found in in this article a novel automated method for the multiple_alignment of gc gc_ms peaks is introduced bidirectional best_hit peak assignment and clique extension for d chromatograms bipace d which is based on comparing peak mass_spectra and rts in two dimensions between a large number of samples
