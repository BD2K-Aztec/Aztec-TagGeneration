datamonkey a suite of phylogenetic_analysis tools for evolutionary_biology datamonkey is a popular web_based suite of phylog enetic analysis tools for use in evolutionary_biology since the original release in we have expanded the analysis options to include recently_developed algorithmic methods for recombination detection evolutionary fingerprinting of genes codon model_selection co evolution between sites identification of sites which rapidly escape host immune pressure and hiv subtype assignment the traditional selection tools have also been augmented to include recent_developments in the field here we summarize the analyses options currently available on datamonkey and provide guidelines for their use in evolutionary_biology recent_developments of high_throughput have accelerated the rate at which genomic_data are accumulating by orders_of concurrent commoditization of cheap parallel computer systems clusters gpus and multi core systems and rapid development of algorithmic statistical and bioinformatics techniques have made it possible to analyze these genomic_data with models of increased biological realism to make such models developed by ourselves and other groups immediately useful to the life_sciences community we deployed a public web_service to screen alignments of homologous_sequences for signatures of natural_selection using three different phylogenetic_methods kosakovsky pond and frost a kosakovsky on a processor cluster in the server proved to be popular processing over submitted jobs many of which would require days or weeks of desktop cpu time since the original release we have completely redesigned the user_interface upgraded our cluster to one with cpu cores implemented new analytical modules and a plethora of result processing and visualization features improvements to core algorithms in the hyphy package have resulted in significant up to speedups and allowed us to increase the sizes of alignments that can be submitted to whom correspondence should be addressed the ever accelerating pace of methodological research and development places a premium on resources that avail computational and evolutionary_biologists and bioinformaticians of fast maintained and documented modern tools with a consistent and easy to use interface as evidenced by the popularity of the original datamonkey server our approach of providing a web_based front end for running computationally_intensive statistical sequence_analysis on a large computer cluster continues to be wellreceived by the community and we fully intend to develop and
