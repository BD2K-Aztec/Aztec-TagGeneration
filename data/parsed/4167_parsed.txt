genetics_and sedus segmental_duplication simulator sedus is the first flexible and user_friendly forward in time simulator of patterns of molecular_evolution within segmental_duplications undergoing interlocus gene_conversion and crossover sedus introduces known features of interlocus gene_conversion such as biased directionality and dependence on local sequence_identity additionally it includes aspects such as different selective_pressures acting upon copy_number and flexible crossover distributions a graphical_user allows fast fine_tuning of relevant_parameters and straightforward real_time analysis of the evolution of duplicates availability_and sedus is implemented in c and can be run via command_line or through a graphical_user developed using qt c source_code and binary executables for linux os x and windows are freely_available at www biologiaevolutiva org sedus a tutorial with a detailed_description of implementation parameters and output_files is available online the evolution of duplicated regions of the genome has attracted the attention of evolutionary_biologists since susumuproposed that they are a fundamental source of novel genes and functions duplicated regions are a pervasive characteristic of eukaryotic_genomes and can span up to hundreds of kilobases encompassing several genes such is the case of segmental_duplications kb similarity which are known to originate copy_number and chromosomal_rearrangements and to underlie the susceptibility to many diseases duplicated regions have a distinctive_feature that crucially affects their evolution they exchange genetic_information through a type of gene_conversion referred to as ectopic non allelic or interlocus gene_conversion igc which differs from usual allelic gene_conversion in that it happens between paralog genomic_regions igc is a major_driver of the concerted_evolution of duplicates which complicates the application of conventional population_genetic interpretations such as the molecular_clock to these regions simulating duplicated sequences under the coalescent has provided_important their neutral molecular_evolution however because of computing time limitations coalescent simulators can only explore a restricted range of parameters particularly regarding recombination moreover they preclude simulating igc rate dependence on sequence_similarity here we present a forward in time simulator of the molecular_evolution of segmental_duplications designed to explore their patterns of concerted_evolution under a wide_range of parameters we have named this software sedus segmental_duplication simulator sedus is an improved and extended version of the in house scripts used in previous work from our group on top of command_line execution sedus comes with an independent user_friendly graphical_user gui allowing control over the most important parameters and direct visualization of simulation_results thus sedus has not only research applicability but can also be a great tool for educators to our knowledge sedus is the first user_friendly forwardin time population_genetics simulator specifically aimed at addressing the evolution of segmental_duplications while giving full consideration to igc our algorithm has a modular_architecture allowing the user to easily modify specific functions or to incorporate new features sedus is under constant development and updates will be presented accordingly
