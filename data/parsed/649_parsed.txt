structural_bioinformatics ballaxy web_services for structural_bioinformatics motivation web_based workflow systems have gained considerable momentum in sequence oriented bioinformatics in structural bio informatics however such systems are still relatively rare while commercial stand alone workflow applications are common in the pharmaceutical_industry academic researchers often still rely on command_line scripting to glue individual tools together results in this work we address the problem of building a web_based system for workflows in structural_bioinformatics for the underlying molecular_modelling engine we opted for the ball framework because of its extensive and well tested functionality in the field of structural_bioinformatics the large number of molecular data_structures and algorithms implemented in ball allows for elegant and sophisticated development of new approaches in the field we hence connected the versatile ball library and its visualization and editing front end ballview with the galaxy workflow framework the result which we call ballaxy enables the user to simply and intuitively create sophisticated pipelines for applications in structure based computational_biology integrated into a standard tool for molecular_modelling availability_and ballaxy consists of three parts some minor modifications to the galaxy system a collection of tools and an integration into the ball framework and the ballview application for molecular_modelling modifications to galaxy will be submitted to the galaxy project and the ball and ballview integrations will be integrated in the next major ball release after acceptance of the modifications into the galaxy project we will publish all ballaxy tools via the galaxy toolshed in the meantime all three components are available from http www ball project org ballaxy also docker images for ballaxy are available at https registry hub docker workflow systems have become increasingly popular in many areas of computational_biology in addition to the creation and sharing of powerful workflows that can be seen as a modern alternative to shell based scripting such systems foster the reproducibility of results in computational science and offer benefits with respect to the deployment and configuration of software_packages this latter part is particularly clear for systems that offer a web_based user_interface that can be accessed using a standard web_browser with its commonly_accepted set of interface metaphors installation and maintenance of such systems can be centralized although parameter_settings and special combinations of tools into processing chains can be stored per user and manipulated through the browser one important example is the popular galaxy system in structural_bioinformatics the number of workflow enabled portals appears to be smaller than in computational genomics for instance one prominent example of such a system for computational_chemistry is the mosgrid molecular_simulation grid portal which offers predefined workflows for quantum calculations molecular_dynamics and docking based on unicore and ws pgrade guse technologies although many typical use cases are well covered it remains difficult for novice users to modify or extend the existing mosgrid workflow one reason for the relative scarcity of easily extensible structure based workflow systems is the difficulty of supporting much of the functionality of an inherently d discipline through the confines of a typically d workspace of a workflow toolkit such as the one offered by the browser connected to a galaxy instance while sequence_based tools mainly require text_based visualization and d plots sophisticated molecular_structure manipulation demands versatile tools that interact with a d molecular system hence a web_based workflow system for structural computational_biology would at present require constant switching between tools from the commonly locally installed molecular_modelling application to the web_service and vice_versa recurrent data transfer causes repeated up and downloads which are cumbersome and can be time consuming in this work we present an approach to combine web_based workflow management with a classical powerful molecular_modelling interface to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com
