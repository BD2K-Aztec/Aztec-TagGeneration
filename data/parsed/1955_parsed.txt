genetics_and gencrypt one way cryptographic hashes to detect overlapping individuals across samples meta_analysis across genome_wide is a common approach for discovering genetic_associations however in some meta_analysis efforts individual_level data cannot be broadly shared by study investigators due to privacy and institutional_review concerns in such cases researchers cannot confirm that each study represents a unique group of people leading to potentially inflated test_statistics and false_positives to resolve this problem we created a software_tool gencrypt which utilizes a security protocol known as one way cryptographic hashes to allow overlapping participants to be identified without sharing individual_level data genome_wide gwass have identified over genomic_loci associated with numerous_diseases and traits these associations are often discovered by meta_analysis of summary_statistics from multiple independent cohorts one key concern of this type of approach is that the same individuals may be present in multiple cohorts especially if the cohorts recruit from overlapping regions the presence of duplicate individuals in multiple studies may affect meta_analysis results producing inflated test_statistics and spurious_associations however sharing individual_level data across research groups is often not permissible due to institutional_review irb restrictions thus inhibiting researchers from directly assessing whether individuals are present in multiple datasets overlapping individuals to address_this we have created a software_suite gencrypt which takes_advantage of a security protocol known as one way cryptographic hashes one way cryptographic hashes are a form of security algorithms that alter input in such a way that the resulting output bears no resemblance to the original content referred to as digesting to whom correspondence should be addressed the input and attempt to produce a unique output for each unique input referred to as a collision when this fails cryptographic approaches have already successfully been applied to other fields in biology such as dna forensics the advantages of using such an algorithm in the context of gwass is that the original genotype specificity is kept but the privacy that is necessary to maintain when using irb and consent form protected data are not compromised as a result we can use one way cryptographic hashes on genetic_information and compare the resulting outputs against one another to securely ascertain identical individuals between datasets used in gwass we tested gencrypt on two datasets derived from real genotype data the first test_dataset was based on african_american individuals collected from maywood il and genotyped on the affymetrix snp_array a total of individuals were broken into two subsets of and with individuals overlapping between the two groups twenty thousand snps were randomly_chosen from a full set of snps available as a test of the programs robustness to methods of snp selection and to show gencrypts utility with a small number of snps used a variety of snp groupings per hash were tested ranging from snps per hash to snps per hash to test the performance of gencrypt with a fixed rate of missingness missing genotypes were given a randomly_chosen genotype based on the missing snps alleles individuals were included in both halves of the dataset and then of genotypes were removed randomly across all individuals for every snp grouping tested all duplicate pairs of individuals were identified additionally when fewer than snps per group were used per hash other familial relations were picked up such as first_degree however using snps per hash is not recommended due to the potential insecurity hashes based on snp groupings of these sizes have when snps per group were used none of the non duplicate pairs of individuals produced a spuriously overlapping hash for groups of and snps the percentages of identical hashes for duplicate individuals ranged from to supplementary while including more snps per hash does decrease the total number of identical hashes found between two overlapping individuals using snps per hash still produces of total hash comparisons per duplicate pair as being identical to test gencrypts performance with the addition of genotyping error a random and of snps in both halves of the maywood data had a single allele altered miscalled in order to simulate a range of genotyping error_rates these datasets were then run through gencrypt using a hash group size of snps for genotyping error_rates of and all duplicate individuals were still identified with decreasing amounts of overlapping hashes between identical individuals a total of out of individuals were identified with genotyping error and out of individuals were identified with genotyping error supplemental while gencrypt is robust to low and realistic levels of genotyping error snps should still be selected to minimize the effects of genotyping error the second dataset used was the publicly_available us gokind study a group of individuals from the usa and canada with long_term type_diabetes these were genotyped on the affymetrix snp_array and five duplicate pairsof individuals genotyped separately had been identified in the qc process in this case missing_data were maintained as is to test the performance of gencrypt in a real_dataset twenty thousand snps were randomly extracted from the full dataset of snps and size groupings of were used the resulting output was compared against itself with results between people of the same individual ids dropped and not considered duplicates for three of the five known duplicate pairs of their hash outputs were identical the other two pairs of duplicate individuals were still detected with and of hash outputs being identical in each of these two pairs one of the two input genotypes had missingness rates and despite the relatively low proportion of identical hash outputs these five pairs were the only pairs identified with any duplicate hashes among the pairs compared demonstrating the high_specificity of gencrypt
