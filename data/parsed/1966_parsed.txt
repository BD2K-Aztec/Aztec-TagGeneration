databases_and advance_access gene_list significance at a glance with genevalorization motivation high_throughput provide_fundamental informations concerning thousands of genes many of the current research_laboratories daily use one or more of these technologies and end up with lists of genes assessing the originality of the results obtained includes being aware of the number of publications available concerning individual or multiple genes and accessing information about these publications faced with the exponential_growth of publications avaliable and number of genes involved in a study this task is becoming particularly difficult to achieve results we introduce genevalorization a web_based that gives a clear and handful overview of the bibliography available corresponding to the user input formed by i a gene_list expressed by gene names or ids from entrezgene and ii a context of study expressed by keywords from this input genevalorization provides a matrix containing the number of publications with co occurrences of gene names and keywords graphics are automatically generated to assess the relative importance of genes within various contexts links to publications and other databases offering information on genes and keywords are also available to illustrate how helpful genevalorization is we will consider the gene_list of the oncotypedx prognostic_marker test high_throughput e g comparative pan genomic hybridization gene_expression protein and methylation arrays high_throughput are major promising and very exciting tools to study biology each of them provide_fundamental informations concerning thousands of genes such as their normal functions or specific alterations e g dna copy_number loss_of change in expression promoter_methylation mutation or post_translational many of the current biological research_laboratories daily use one or more of these technologies selecting genes of interest to design further experiments is of paramount_importance in this to whom correspondence should be addressed process scientists need to access the latest publications concerning individual or multiple genes among the genes they may consider researchers need to distinguish three categories of genes i genes already clearly shown to be associated with the process they are studying ii new and promising genes for a particular research field whose interest is well known in other research_fields iii genes that have not been studied this task is becoming particularly difficult to achieve faced with the many gene_lists which are retrieved and the exponential_growth of publications available in this article we introduce a web_based named genevalorization given a list of gene names and a set of keywords describing the context of the study genevalorization provides a matrix with the number of publications cociting each gene name and keyword genevalorization thus gives very quickly a clear and handful overview of the bibliography corresponding to a gene_list of interest within a given context of study to illustrate how helpful genevalorization is we consider here the gene_list of the oncotypedx prognostic_marker test which is composed of genes and used to determine the individual relapse_risk of a breast_cancer patient
