incorporating organelle correlations into semi_supervised for protein subcellular_localization prediction motivation bioimages of subcellular protein distribution as a new data source have attracted_much in the field of automated prediction of proteins subcellular_localization performance of existing_systems is significantly limited by the small number of high_quality images with explicit annotations resulting in the small_sample learning_problem this limitation is more serious for the multi location proteins that co exist at two or more organelles because it is difficult to accurately annotate those proteins by biological_experiments or automated_systems results in this study we designed a new protein subcellular_localization prediction pipeline aiming to deal with the small_sample learning and multi location proteins annotation problems five semi_supervised algorithms that can make use of lower_quality data were integrated and a new multi_label approach by incorporating the correlations among different organelles in cells was proposed the organelle correlations were modeled by the bayesian_network and the topology of the correlation graph was used to guide the order of binary classifiers training in the multi_label to reflect the label dependence relationship the proposed_protocol was applied on both immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence images and our experimental_results demonstrated its efficiency availability_and the datasets and code are available at www csbio sjtu edu cn bioinf corrasemib a cell contains proteins functioning in different organelles and knowledge of the subcellular_localization of those proteins can provide_important for understanding their functions for example mitochondria are responsible for cellular aerobic_respiration and producing energy while golgi_apparatus act to process and package the biological_macromolecules annotating proteins subcellular patterns using biological_experiments is in general too expensive in both time and costs so various automated_systems have been developed in these years the data source to the automated predictors can be either protein amino_acid or microscopy bioimage the sequence_based annotation methods usually utilize the homology transfer or targeting signal to predict the location motif different from the d amino_acid the d bioimage based pattern analysis can get more intuitive and quantitative spatial distribution information the bioimage analysis hasgained popularity with the rapid advance of microscopic_imaging and image_processing over the past_two many protein bioimage repositories with annotations of subcellular_location have been constructed in recent_years for instance the human_protein hpa http proteinatlas org stores millions of microscopic images of immunohistochemistry ihc and immunofluorescence if showing the spatial distribution of proteins in cells however the proportion of reliable data in the hpa is still small where only protein samples in hpa have high_quality ihc images and less than half of the if images have high_reliability subcellular annotations under this situation previous_efforts that trained statistical supervised classifiers in the feature_space extracted from just high_quality and high_reliability images will not only reduce the generalization ability but also cause a waste of a large ratio of lower_quality and unlabeled data using which can be a solution to the current difficulty of small_sample of high_quality samples semi_supervised is a branch of statistical machine_learning that is able to incorporate the unlabeled samples into model construction according to the way of how to use unlabeled samples semi_supervised approaches can be grouped in three different types the first is the heuristic based_approach that uses unlabeled data within a supervised_learning framework for example one of the earliest semi_supervised methods is a heuristic_method which is also known as self training it trains classifier and predicts unlabeled data to generate more labeled samples that can be used as additional_training data for updating the classifier iteratively later on other variants of heuristic based_approaches have been developed such as co training and coforest method recently our group also developed a knowledge guided semi_supervised protocol following this direction named asemib it uses cross class transferred knowledge as a guide to add the unlabeled samples which has achieved encouraging performance the second group is the graph based_methods which usually use a graph where nodes stand for the samples and edges represent the pairwise relationship between samples subsequently they propagate labels from labeled nodes to unlabeled nodes the third type is known as the transductive learning which is usually built on the cluster assumption that the data tends to form discrete groups thus they attempt to place decision boundaries in low_density regions obviously the mathematical hypotheses of the above semisupervised learning algorithms are different to test the detailed performance of different types of semi_supervised protocols on tackling the small_size of high_quality samples problem in bioimaging based protein subcellular_location prediction five widely used semi_supervised algorithms from the three different types are systematically investigated in this study our results showed that they performed very differently on the benchmark_datasets and also demonstrated that an ensemble of them would generate better accuracy than any single algorithm another challenge in protein subcellular_location prediction is handling the multi location proteins which simultaneously localize at two or more organelles a recent study of applying fluorescentprotein tagging techniques on mammalian_cells showed that multilabel proteins account for this is a very high ratio posing the importance of a classification system that is capable of effectively learning the multiplex features the core difference of a multi_label system from a single label one is that it should be able to assign a set of labels to the query rather than one single label the binary relevance br idea has been widely used to construct the multi_label classifier it transforms one multi_label problem into several independent binary classification_problems ignoring the dependence relationship among classes such independence_assumption has problems on the topic studied in this paper actually there are underlying correlations among subcellular_locations in cells these correlations can be spatial_proximity functional correlations or other such reasons that can make some organelles have a higher probability of appearing simultaneously in annotations for example the proteins colocalizing in plasma_membrane and endosomes are very common than other cases because endosomes are derived from the plasma_membrane modeling and incorporating such underlying correlations in classification would have important effects on prediction results in this article we modeled the label correlations among subcellular_locations by a bayesian graph_model and subsequently used it to guide both the order of binary classifiers training and as additional features fed in each classifier in this way the label dependence can be properly modeled which was implemented in the proposed ensemble semi_supervised framework for further performance enhancement
