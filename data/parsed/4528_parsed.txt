tapir a web_server for the prediction of plant microrna targets including target mimics we present a new web_server called tapir designed for the prediction of plant microrna targets the server offers the possibility to search for plant mirna_targets using a fast and a precise algorithm the precise option is much slower but guarantees to find less perfectly paired mirna_target duplexes furthermore the precise option allows the prediction of target mimics which are characterized by a mirna_target duplex having a large loop making them undetectable by traditional tools availability the tapir web_server can be accessed at micrornas mirnas constitute a prominent class of small_non that regulate_gene at the posttranscriptional level in plants mirnas are the key_regulators involved in various developmental stress and cellular_responses with the rise of next_generation data new mirnas are uncovered in various plant_genomes at a rapid pace one of the major challenges is then to determine their function and a crucial step towards this goal is the identification of the mirnas targets candidate targets can be identified through base_pair complementarity of the mirna sequence to mrna_sequences the mirnamrna duplexes were originally_thought to have few mismatches gu pairs and bulges but there is now increasing evidence that less perfect hybridizations might also be functional leading in some cases to translational_repression rather than cleavage of the target_mrna recent_reports have also revealed the existence in plants of a phenomenon called mirna_target mimicry where mirnamrna duplexes with a large bulge around the cleavage_site actually sequester mirnas resulting in an inhibition of the mirna_activity we have designed and implemented tapir a novel web_server dedicated to the prediction of plant mirnas including mirna_target mimics to whom correspondence should be addressed
