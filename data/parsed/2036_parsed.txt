genome_analysis genomicus a database and a browser to study gene synteny in modern and ancestral_genomes comparative_genomics remains a pivotal strategy to study the evolution of gene organization and this primacy is reinforced by the growing number of full genome_sequences available in public_repositories despite this growth bioinformatic_tools available to visualize and compare genomes and to infer evolutionary_events remain restricted to two or three genomes at a time thus limiting the breadth and the nature of the question that can be investigated here we present genomicus a new synteny browser that can represent and comparefrom less than fully_sequenced metazoan genomes years_ago nearly species are now represented in a variety of centralized databases this abundance of sequence_data has reinforced the role of comparative_genomics as the primary approach to gain insight in the organization of a genome comparing sequences from different species serves several purposes i to outline conserved_regions a powerful guide to rapidly focus on functional_regions ii to document differences among these functional sequences as a first step to understand broader biological differences metabolic developmental etc between organisms and iii to identify evolutionary_events that have interrupted the gene colinearity between the genomes of two species since their last common_ancestor to document and study the latter the inference of ancestral gene orders starting from extant_species provides important reference_points yet no visualization_tool currently allows comparisons between an ancestral_genome to one or more of its modern descendant existing software still limit the comparison to two or three extant genomes at a time and are restricted to a limited range of species derrien to whom correspondence should be addressed to address_these we have developed genomicus a browser dedicated to the study of synteny and the conservation of gene_order among multiple_genomes currently metazoan genomes and the yeast_saccharomyces importantly genomicus also integrates reconstructed ancestral synteny_blocks at ancestral nodes
