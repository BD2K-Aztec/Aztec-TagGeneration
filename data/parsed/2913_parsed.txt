metapathways v quantitative functional taxonomic and usability improvements next_generation is producing vast_amounts of sequence_information from natural and engineered ecosystems although this data deluge has an enormous_potential to transform our lives knowledge creation and translation need software applications that scale with increasing data_processing and analysis requirements here we present improvements to metapathways an annotation and analysis_pipeline for environmental sequence_information that expedites this transformation we specifically address pathway prediction hazards through integration of a weighted taxonomic distance and enable quantitative_comparison of assembled annotations through a normalized read_mapping measure additionally we improve last homology_searches through blast equivalent e values and output_formats that are natively compatible with prevailing software applications finally an updated graphical_user allows for keyword annotation query and projection onto user_defined functional gene hierarchies including the carbohydrate active_enzyme database availability_and metapathways v is available on github http github com hal lamlab metapathways contact since the publication of metapathways a modular annotation and analysis_pipeline that enables construction of environmental pathway genome_databases using pathway tools and metacyc there have been improvements to the software via the knowledge engine data_structure a graphical_user gui for data management and browsing and a masterworker model for task distribution on grids and clouds version features faster and more accurate quantitative functional and taxonomic inference inspired by the pathway centric analysis of the hawaii ocean time series a weighted taxonomic distance wtd has been integrated to detect taxonomic divergence of predicted metacyc pathways next because it is difficult to determine relative open_reading orf abundance in assembled datasets we adopt reads per kilobase per million mapped rpkm to provide_a of sequence_coverage on a per orf basis additionally the last code has been modified to calculate blastequivalent bit score and e value statistics we benchmarked the implemented improvements described earlier using illumina sequenced marine metagenomic_samples the wtd distribution can be used as an informative tool to place pathways into different taxonomic hazard classes based on their order_statistics protein annotations of blast and last are highly_correlated in terms of e value suggesting roughly_equivalent results but with last being significantly_faster although there is a positive correlation between rpkm score and orf count variance about the regression_line indicates rpkm makes a correction in many instances
