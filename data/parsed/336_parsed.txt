structural_bioinformatics a new framework for computational_protein through cost_function network optimization motivation the main_challenge for structure based computational_protein cpd remains the combinatorial nature of the search_space even in its simplest fixed backbone formulation cpd encompasses a computationally difficult np_hard that prevents the exact exploration of complex systems defining large sequence con formation spaces results we present here a cpd framework based on cost_function network cfn solving a recent exact combinatorial optimization_technique to efficiently handle highly complex combinatorial spaces encountered in various protein design_problems we show that the cfn based_approach is able to solve optimality a variety of complex designs that could often not be solved using a usual cpd dedicated tool or state of the art exact operations research_tools beyond the identification of the optimal_solution the global minimum energy con formation the cfn based method is also able to quickly enumerate large ensembles of suboptimal solutions of interest to rationally build experimental enzyme mutant libraries availability the combined pipeline used to generate energetic models based on a patched version of the open_source solver osprey the conversion to cfn models based on perl scripts and cfn solving based on the open_source solver toulbar are all available atthe engineering of tailored proteins with desired_properties holds great interest for applications ranging from medicine biotechnology and synthetic_biology to nanotechnologies although directed_evolution techniques coupled with high_throughput automated procedures have met with some success they do not provide structural design principles to guide the rational_design of novel proteins the development of generic and effective protein_engineering methodologies both experimental and computational is thus of utmost interest to speedup the design of tailored proteins having the desired_properties structure based computational_protein cpd approaches have demonstrated their potential to adequately capture fundamental aspects of molecular_recognition and interactions which have already enabled the successful re design of several enzymes for various purposes despite these outstanding results the efficiency predictability and reliability of cpd methods have shown that they still need to mature cpd is faced with several challenges the first lies in the exponential size of the conformational and protein sequence_space that has to be explored which rapidly grows out of reach of computational_approaches another obstacle to overcome is the unsolved issue of accurate structure_prediction for a given sequence therefore the design problem is usually approached as an inverse folding problem to reduce the problem to the identification of an amino_acid that can fold into a target protein d scaffold that matches the design objective this paradigm typically assumes a fixed protein_backbone and for each type of amino_acid considered at a given position allows the side_chains to move only among a set of discrete and lowenergy conformations called rotamers cpd is thus formulated as an optimization_problem which consists in choosing combinations of rotamers at designable specified positions such that the fold is stabilized and the desired property is achieved to solve this problem we need a computationally_tractable energetic model to evaluate the energy of any combination of rotamers we also require computational optimization techniques that can efficiently explore the sequence conformation space to find the sequence conformation model of global minimum energy gmec global minimum energy conformation or an ensemble of low_energy sequence conformation models indeed several reasons can motivate the generation of multiple near optimal solutions first the sequence conformation model with the lowest predicted energy may not fold into the targeted protein_scaffold owing to inaccuracies in the modeling of protein energetics secondly the gmec solution may be so stabilized that it can lack the flexibility required to operate the protein biological_function such suboptimal ensembles can then be analyzed to rationally guide the to whom correspondence should be addressed
