the cardiac atlas project an imaging database for computational_modeling and statistical atlases of the heart motivation integrative mathematical and statistical_models of cardiac anatomy and physiology can play_a in understanding cardiac_disease phenotype and planning therapeutic_strategies however the accuracy and predictive_power of such models is dependent upon the breadth and depth of noninvasive_imaging datasets the cardiac atlas project cap has established a large_scale database of cardiac imaging_examinations and associated clinical data in order to develop a shareable web accessible structural and functional atlas of the normal and pathological heart for clinical research and educational purposes a goal of cap is to facilitate collaborative statistical_analysis of regional heart shape and wall_motion and characterize cardiac_function among and within population groups results three main open_source components were developed i a database with web_interface ii a modeling client for d time visualization and parametric description of shape and motion and iii open data_formats for semantic characterization of models and annotations the database was implemented using a three tier architecture utilizing mysql jboss and dcm chee in compliance with the dicom standard to provide compatibility with existing clinical networks and devices parts of dcm chee were extended to access image specific attributes as search parameters to date approximately de identified cardiac imaging_examinations are available in the database all software components developed by the cap are open_source and are freely_available under the mozilla public license version in both the clinical and research settings a variety of techniques can be used to quantify cardiac_performance at various structural and functional levels electrocardiography allows monitoring of the electrical_activity of the heart to diagnose pathology such as rhythm_disturbances myocardial_infarction and hypertrophy blood_pressure measurements enable detection of hypertension cardiovascular imaging_studies provide quantification of cardiac mass and volumes as well as assessment of regional heart wall_motion the ability to integrate these multi source multivariate_data has enormous implications for the diagnosis and clinical care of patients mathematical and computational_models can be used to integrate data in a standardized way providing both a big picture population map of the various factors that determine cardiac_function as well as highly_detailed information which can be used to characterize function in an individual patient patient specific models these models can elucidate the complex interaction of electrical anatomical and functional data to provide insight into the processes underlying the normal or pathological function of the heart furthermore models derived from large populations of patients can provide a range of reference_values against which individual patients data can be compared a number of biomedical initiatives use computational_modeling to integrate multi_scale anatomical functional and clinical data from diverse sources these include the physiome project the international_consortium for brain_mapping informatics for integrating biology and the bedside i b and the cardiac gene_expression database among others these projects depend on large population databases for the development and validation of physiological models the cardiac atlas project cap is an international_collaboration to establish a large_scale standardized database of cardiac imaging_examinations and derived functional_analyses the aim is to develop a computational structural and functional atlas of the normal and pathological heart these atlases can be defined as a set of mapspage
