reconstructing the architecture of the ancestral amniote genome motivation the ancestor of birds and mammals lived approximately million_years inferring its genome_organization is key to understanding the differentiated evolution of these two lineages however detecting traces of its chromosomal organization in its extant descendants is difficult due to the accumulation of molecular_evolution since birds and mammals lineages diverged results we address several methodological_issues for the detection and assembly of ancestral genomic_features of ancient vertebrate_genomes which encompass adjacencies contiguous segments syntenies and double syntenies in the context of a whole_genome using generic but stringent methods for all these problems some of them new we analyze vertebrate_genomes including amniotes and teleost fishes and infer a high_resolution genome_organization of the amniote ancestral_genome composed of ancestral linkage_groups at a resolution of kb we extensively discuss the validity and robustness of the method to variations of data and parameters we introduce a support value for each of the groups and show that out of have maximum support conclusions single methodological principle cannot currently be used to infer the organization of the amniote ancestral_genome and we demonstrate that it is possible to gather several principles into a computational paleogenomics pipeline this strategy offers a solid methodological base for the reconstruction of ancient vertebrate_genomes availability source_code in c and python is available atthe reconstruction of ancestral karyotypes and gene orders from homologies between extant_species contributes to understanding the large_scale evolutionary mutations that led to current genomes from their last common_ancestor for example given ancestral_genomes or gene orders distances and evolutionary_scenarios between genomes can be computed along branches of the considered phylogenetic_tree and not only between pairs of extant_species more generally one can hope to work within an to whom correspondence should be addressed evolutionary framework combining ancestral and extant genomes in a robust phylogenetic_tree the ancestral reconstruction problem has been approached for eukaryotic_genomes using cytogenetics techniques pioneered by dobzhansky and sturtevant and recently applied to mammalian_genomes however when dealing with older ancestors and larger evolutionary_distances homologies are less visible by cytogenetics methods it is only with the recent availability of sequenced and assembled_genomes that bioinformatics_methods can handle the problem of predicting the deep past of metazoan chromosomes reviews by muffato and roest crollius these methods address the problem at a higher_resolution than cytogenetics techniques as they require assembled_genomes either fully or at least in large contigs and scaffolds the results obtained on mammalian_genomes based on genome rearrangement models or on physical_mapping methods slowly converge toward the cytogenetics ones ferguson prospective methods have attempted the reconstruction of more ancient animal proto genomes amniotes bony fishes vertebrates chordates or even eumetazoa however the accuracy of these ad_hoc methodologies has not been studied as thoroughly as for more generic methods the ability of the latter to produce reliable results on mammalian or yeast genomes was evaluated either by comparisons to cytogenetics or manual reconstructions the validation of the results is indeed a major_issue since ancient genomes can not be sequenced due to dna decay simulations although used in a few studies face the currently limited understanding of large_scale evolutionary_processes such as genome_rearrangements and gene losses following a whole_genome wgd cytogenetic results or manual reconstructions are not available for very ancient genomes the goal of the present work is to propose a general_methodology for inferring ancestral_genome segments and linkage_groups based on several comparative_genomics principles grouped into a physical_mapping framework the framework we describe can be applied to any ancestral species following the speciation from the teleostfishes tetrapods sarcopterigians for example provided sequenced extant genomes from two branches descending from an ancestor are available we apply it to the ancestral amniote genome we study the validity and robustness of the method and results and we argue that it is possible to evaluate an ancestral_genome reconstruction based on the careful examination of the underlying principles of the method these principles are i the detection of ancestral features adjacencies collinear or contiguous segments syntenic groups based on their conservation in the extant genomes and ii the assembly of such features into ancestral chromosomal segments and linkage_groups hence we design the reconstruction_process as a pipeline decomposed into several phases each focused on the detection assembly of a specific kind of ancestral genomic feature this requires to define for each such phase an appropriate combinatorial representation of the corresponding assembled ancestral features including pq trees to represent contiguous ancestral regions as in chauve and and graphs to represent ancestral linkage_groups algs as in the final representation of an ancestral_genome is a nested combination of such combinatorial objects we apply this pipeline to reconstruct the amniote ancestral_genome at a kb resolution tailoring the method to account for the phylogeny and presence of a whole_genome at the base of the teleost lineage we obtain algs covering a significant part of the extant amniote genomes which is a improvement on the two previous_studies of this ancestral_genome the syntenic associations between extant amniote chromosomes that we predict confirm three associations found in previous_studies but also include two new ones we discuss the accuracy of the results produced by our method and the robustness of the method to variations of data and parameters we implemented all the principles described above and analyzed a dataset containing amniote genomes human chimpanzee orangutan macaca mouse rat dog cow horse opossum zebra_finch chicken and teleost_fish genomes tetraodon stickleback medaka the amniote genomes were chosen because they were assembled and present in a multiple_alignments of amniote genomes available in the release of the ensembl_database obtained using pecan all data multiple_alignments of amniote genomes gene contents and gene_trees were downloaded from the ensembl compara database the phylogeny including branch_lengths was taken from paleontological data branch_lengths are defined to be the normalized lower bounds of speciation times given by paleontological evidences in order to avoid any a priori_hypotheses i on rearrangement rates we computed ancestral blocks with resolution min len kb and we obtained ancestral blocks together with their orientations in the amniote genomes resulting in ancestral markers two markers per block one for each extremity we described a general_methodology for inferring ancestral_genomes that relies on a hierarchical process computing ancestral blocks computing cars and computing the asg and algs we implemented this general approach using stringent methods for each phase tailored to account for the specificity of the evolution of amniote genomes and we applied it to infer large ancestral amniote linkage_groups at a kb resolution from whole_genome alignments and gene_families this resulted in the first proposal of an ancestral amniote genome that covers large_parts of its extant descendants proposed significantly more amniote syntenic associations than we do one explanation is the stringency of the method we use to detect double ancestral syntenies indeed due to the stability of bird genomes and the absence of reptile genomes in the considered dataset the only syntenic associations that can be detected are supported by double ancestral syntenies we find that the associations and z are the only ones to be supported by a pair of blocks that belong to more than one dcs this illustrates the fact that combinatorial traces of synteny conservation at a large evolutionary distance are quite degraded and not widespread even when several amniote genomes are considered even if we cannot definitively argue that the syntenic associations described in the previous ancestral_genome proposals are wrong we believe that they rely on a weaker synteny conservation signal as illustrated by the case of the putative syntenic association z see discussion below we even found no evidence that the medaka genome is as stable as claimed by for example does not show more conserved dcs signal in the medaka than in the two other teleost fishes we now discuss a few examples of syntenic associations that were reported by both but not by our method as they illustrate the interest of methodological discussions to analyze such discrepancies the association between chicken chromosomes and was out of reach for us as no ancestral block did belong to chicken chromosome the signal we observe for an association between chicken chromosomes and does not support clearly the fact it was present in the amniote ancestor it can be related to two ancestral blocks contiguous in all placental mammalian_genomes but not in the opossum genome and that do not belong to a dcs which indicates more likely an ancestral boreoeutherian feature finally the case of the association z is interesting we detect a faint signal for it based on three blocks present on a single dcs in the macaca genome and on the same chromosomes in the human chimpanzee and orangutan genomes but which does not satisfy the phylogenetic conservation criterion we use to retain edges of the asg there are also two blocks contiguous in all placental mammalians and that also belong to a genome segment that shows a dcs signal that does not satisfy the stringent definition we used so we leave open the possibility that the association z is present in the amniote ancestral_genome the signal related to associations and as well as for associations z and which are specific to our study is described in supplementary_material
