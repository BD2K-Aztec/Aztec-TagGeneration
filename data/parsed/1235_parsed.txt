systems_biology cytosaddlesum a functional_enrichment plugin for cytoscape based on sum of weights scores cytosaddlesum provides cytoscape users with access to the functionality of saddlesum a functional enrichment tool based on sum of weight scores it operates by querying saddlesum locally using the standalone version or remotely through an http request to a web_server the functional enrichment results are shown as a term relationship network where nodes represent terms and edges show term relationships furthermore query results are written as cytoscape attributes allowing easy saving retrieval and integration into network based data analysis workflows availability www ncbi nlm nih gov cbbresearch yu downloads html the source_code is placed in public_domain cytosaddlesum is a cytoscape_plugin to access the functionality of saddlesum an enrichment_analysis tool based on sum of weights score stojmirovic unlike most other enrichment tools saddlesum does not require users to directly select significant genes or perform extensive simulations to compute statistics instead it uses weights derived from measurements such as log expression ratios to produce a score for each database term it then estimates depending on the number of genes involved the p value for that score by using the saddlepoint approximation to the empirical distribution function derived from all weights this approach was shown stojmirovic to yield accurate p values and internally_consistent retrievals as a popular and flexible platform for visualization integration and analysis of network data cytoscape allows gene_expression data import and hosts numerous plugins for functional_enrichment however none of these plugins are based on the gene_set approach that takes_into gene weights therefore to fill this gap we have developed cytosaddlesum a cytoscape interface to saddlesum to enable several desirable features of cytosaddlesum however we had to significantly extend the original saddlesum code see descriptions below to whom correspondence should be addressed
