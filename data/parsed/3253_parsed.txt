next generation bioinformatics using many core processor architecture to develop a web_service for sequence_alignment motivation bioinformatics algorithms and computing_power are the main bottlenecks for analyzing huge amount of data generated by the current_technologies such as the next_generation methodologies at the same time most powerful microprocessors are based on many core chips yet most applications cannot exploit such power requiring parallelized algorithms as an example of next generation bioinformatics we have developed from scratch a new parallelization of the needlemanwunsch nw sequence_alignment algorithm for the core tile microprocessor the unprecedented performance it offers for a standalone personal computer pc is discussed optimally aligning sequences up to times_faster than the non parallelized version thus saving valuable time availability this algorithm is available as a free web_service for the scientific_community at http www sicuma uma es multicore the open source_code is also available on such site bioinformatics algorithms and computing_power are the main bottlenecks for analyzing huge amount of data generated by the current_technologies such as the next_generation methodologies whereas multi core processors with a few cores provide a relative_improvement in desktop applications manycore processors chips with tens of cores represent the next big step in affordable high performance computation proposals and prototypes include intel terascale processor sun microsystems ultrasparc t pro and plurality hypercore architecture line hal announced in grenoble december pioneering such developments tilera has released several tile processor based cards together with the tileras multicore development environment mde from a research group point_of one of the main advantages of these cards is that they can be inserted into a pci express slot of a personal computer pc and may be used as a standalone implementation at the same time the host computer to whom correspondence should be addressed central_processing cpu may be used for desktop purposes while the parallel workload is carried_out in the background by the tile card also there is no need to require the services of an expensive remote server to do such work a tile contains cores tiles communicating over a tbps bandwidth imesh architecture yet most current applications cannot exploit such power requiring parallelized algorithms these cards have been deployed so_far on high_throughput video and networking as an example of the next generation of bioinformatics we have demonstrated multi core performance by developing from scratch a parallelized fastlsa algorithm an improvement of the needlemanwunsch nw aligner the tile risc processor lacks floating point instructions so it is not suitable for all types of supercomputing yet we have found that it can be exploited for biological_information management where only integer numbers are used the nw algorithm may be considered the most classical alignment_method when the affine gap improvement is applied to the cost_function fastlsa is an intuitive nw implementation when there are multiple cores and lots of main_memory available thus we have used it as a practical and useful implementation of our development which has been opened publicly by means of a free web_service at http www sicuma uma es multicore
