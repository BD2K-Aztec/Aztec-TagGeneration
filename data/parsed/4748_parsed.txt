data_and tronco an r package for the inference of cancer_progression from heterogeneous genomic_data motivation we introduce translational oncology tronco an open_source r package that implements the state of the art algorithms for the inference of cancer_progression from epi genomic mutational profiles tronco can be used to extract population level models describing the trends of accumulation of alterations in a cohort of cross_sectional samples e g retrieved from publicly_available databases and individual_level models that reveal the clonal evolutionary_history in single cancer patients when multiple samples e g multiple_biopsies or single_cell sequencing_data are available the resulting models can provide key hints for uncovering the evolutionary_trajectories of cancer especially for precision_medicine or personalized_therapy availability_and tronco is released under the gpl license is hosted at http bimib disco unimib it software section and archived also atcancer develops through the successive expansions of clones in which certain epi genomic_alterations called drivers confer a fitness advantage and progressively accumulate in a context of overall scarcity of resources specifically in nowells seminal work tumor evolution is described in terms of stepwise genetic_variation such that growth_advantage is the key for the survival and prorogation of the clones therefore one can define cancer_progression in terms of probabilistic causal graphical_models where the conditional dependencies and the temporal ordering among these alterations are described revealing the evolutionary_trajectories of cancer at the epi genome level we further distinguish i ensemble level progression models describing the statistical trends of accumulation of genomic_alterations in a cohort of distinct cancer patients such models describe the temporal partial orders of fixation and accumulation of such alterations and represent population level trends and ii individual_level models thus accounting for the specific evolutionary_history of cancer clones in individual tumors such models thus impute the ancestry relations of the observed clones even if the inference of such models is further complicated by a series of theoretical and technical hurdles such as e g intra_and tumor_heterogeneity and the effective detection of drivers it can benefit from the increasing amount of next_generation data currently available through public projects such as the cancer_genome tcga https tcga data nci nih gov usually such databases provide cross_sectional epi genomic_profiles retrieved from single biopsies of cancer patients which can be used to extract ensemble level models but higher_resolution data such as multiple_biopsies or even single_cell sequencing_data are becoming more accessible and reliable which can be used to infer individual_level models here we introduce translational oncology tronco an r package built to infer cancer_progression from heterogeneous genomic_data in the form of alterations persistently present along tumor evolution currently tronco provides the implementation of two algorithms i cancer_progression extraction with single edges caprese and ii cancer_progression inference capri both based on suppes theory of probabilistic causation but with distinct goals and properties see section tronco in its current form and perspective should be thought of as a tool that provides the implementation of up to date solutions to the progression inference problem at the time of the writing it can be effectively used as the final_stage of a modular pipeline for the extraction of ensemble level cancer_progression from cross_sectional data in such a pipeline input_data are pre processed to i stratify samples in tumor_subtypes ii select driver alterations and iii identify groups of fitness equivalent i e mutually_exclusive alterations prior to the application of the capri algorithm the resulting ensemble level progression models depict the evolutionary_dynamics of cancer with translational impacts on diagnostic and therapeutic processes especially in regard to precision_medicine and personalized drug_development from the complementary perspective tronco can also exploit the caprese algorithm to infer the clonal evolutionary_history in single patients when multiple samples are available as in the case of multiple_biopsies and or single_cell sequencing_data as long as the set of driver events is selected see tronco provides up to date theoretically well founded statistical_methods to understand the evolution of a cancer ensamblelevel or a single tumor individual_level the implemented algorithms are demonstrably the state of the art for the progression inference problem in terms of computational_cost scalability with respect to sample_size accuracy and robustness against noise in the data the implementation makes straightforward the interaction of tronco with other common bioinformatics_tools possibly allowing the creation of a common suite of tools for cancer_progression inference finally we refer to eitheror the supplementary_materials for a demonstration of the usage of tronco on real genomics data both at the ensemble level and individual_level progression models in particular this article outlines the capability of the methods to reproduce much of the current knowledge on the progression for a set of cancer_types as well as to suggest clinically_relevant insights furthermore we also provide users with detailed manuals vignettes and source_code to replicate all the analysis presented in the article plus others case studies colorectal_cancer clear_cell and acute chronic_myeloid in the supplementary_materials and at the tronco official webpage software section at http bimib disco unimib it a tronco can process either alterations e g somatic_mutations or wider chromosomal lesions in a cohort of independent samples top lolliplot diagram or a set of multiple snapshots from a unique patient e g multi region or single_cell bottom panel b oncoprints allow the user to visualize the data that the tool is processing regardless of the source each row represents a certain alterationat a custom resolution depending on the cancer under studyand each column a sample c a model inferred with the tool might outline cancer evolution occurring in a population ensemble or in an individual patient graphically alterations are represented as nodes with different colors e g green mutations and blue homozygous_deletions algorithms such as capri allow describing alterations with logical formulas in an attempt to find their role as a group seefor details we picture such groups with dashed lines in the panel we show a hypothetical ensemble level model predicting a selection_pressure on two genes mapped to p tp and hic as it may be inferred by analyzing samples harboring either tp hic mutations or homozygous_deletions in the cytoband where any of these two genes map i e here for purely explanatory cases we suppose just tp which maps to p the model suggests a trend of selection toward mutations in gene y which shall be interpreted as a set of preferential clonal expansions characteristic of the population of analyzed samples involving alterations of the functions mapped to p and y d tronco supports three data types custom data which is supposed to be provided as a binary input matrix storing the presence_or of a certain alteration in a sample or standard data_formats such as the maf for somatic_mutations as well as the gistic format for focal copy_number data can be generated by custom experiments or collectedalong with other omicsfrom public_databases such as tcga and cbio portal for the latter cbio portal tronco implements a query system to fetch data with minimal effort the tool engine can then be used to manipulate genomic profilesregardless of their sourceand run progression inference algorithms
