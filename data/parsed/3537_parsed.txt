systems_biology phosphopick modelling cellular_context to map kinase_substrate phosphorylation_events motivation the determinants of kinase_substrate phosphorylation can be found both in the substrate sequence and the surrounding cellular_context cell_cycle interactions with mediating proteins and even prior phosphorylation_events are necessary for kinases to maintain substrate_specificity while much work has focussed on the use of sequence_based to predict phosphorylation_sites there has been very little work invested into the application of systems_biology to understand phosphorylation lack of specificity in many kinase sub strate binding_motifs means that sequence methods for predicting kinase binding_sites are susceptible to high_false results we present here a model that takes_into protein_protein information and protein_abundance data across the cell_cycle to predict kinase substrates for human kinases that are representative of important biological_pathways the model shows high_accuracy for substrate prediction with an average auc of across the kinases tested when using the model to complement sequence_based kinase specific phosphorylation_site we found that the additional information increased prediction_performance for most comparisons made particularly on kinases from the cmgc family we then used our model to identify functional overlaps between predicted cdk substrates and targets from the e f family_of our results demonstrate that a model harnessing context data can account for the shortfalls in sequence_information and provide a robust description of the cellular_events that regulate protein_phosphorylation availability_and the method is freely_available online as a web_server at the websiteregulation of cellular_processes occurs on multiple levels with epigenetic modifiers and transcription_factors tfs controlling gene_expression while various post_translational regulate many protein functions choudhary motifs alone are insufficient for achieving respectable accuracy in predicting kinase specific phosphorylation_sites as a result prediction_methods have often complemented sequence_information with other types of data such as knowledge of d structure sequence disorder and kinase family similarity while such additional data typically improve prediction_performance to an extent they do not reflect the wider cellular regulatory_mechanisms that cause kinases to target their correct substratesa protein with an appropriate kinase binding_site will not necessarily come into contact with that kinase the phosphorylation of a target substrate by a kinase is not determined solely by its binding_affinity but by various context factors that determine how a kinase comes into contact with its substrates this is recognized by the networkin predictor which combines sequence_based scores with a score generated on the basis of a string network context factors can include cellular_location mediating and activating proteins such as scaffold proteins cyclins and cell_cycle specific expression of kinases and their substrates proteinprotein_interaction ppi data can certainly be used to represent such context factors though while there is vast_amounts of ppi data currently available in databases such as biogrid and string incomplete coverage and variable certainty means that the integration of context features into a model is non trivial in this study we explore a probabilistic_model to accommodate missing_values seamless combination of protein interactions and cell_cycle expression and to provide flexible options for querying potential kinase substrates the model we present here named phosphopick phosphorylation in a protein interaction context for kinases integrates known kinasesubstrate relationships ppi and cell_cycle data to predict kinase substrates for human kinases phosphopick shows high_prediction with a mean auc of across the kinases we then demonstrate how our method can boost the prediction_accuracy of kinase specific phosphorylation_site by combining phosphopick predictions with the phosphorylation_site predictions from three previously_published we find that phosphopick improves kinase specific phosphorylation_site for most comparisons made though greater performance increases were noticed on cmgc kinasesin particular cyclin dependant kinases cdks where we observed substantial performance gains as measured by auc we show that proteins predicted to be cdk substrates by phosphopick have go terms consistent with known cdk substrates and investigate the functional overlap between known and predicted cdk substrates and the targets of specific e f tfs using chip_seq apoptosis and ubiquitination these are both processes that cdk has previously been implicated in and ubiquitination is also known to play_an in regulating apoptotic proteins e f is known to be a regulator of apoptosis and similarly e f can negatively_regulate apoptosis so it was interesting to find that the putative cdk substrates within the unique e f and e f target groups were enriched in apoptosis and ubiquitination go terms these results seem to suggest a dynamic regulatory interplay between the e f family at the transcriptional level and the cdk kinase at the post_translational level
