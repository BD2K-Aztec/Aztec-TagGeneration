databases_and seqdepot streamlined database of biological_sequences and precomputed features assembling and or producing integrated knowledge of sequence_features continues to be an onerous and redundant task despite a large number of existing resources we have developed seqdepota novel database that focuses solely on two primary_goals i assimilating known primary sequences with predicted feature data and ii providing the most simple and straightforward means to procure and readily use this information access to million sequences and million features is provided through a well documented and flexible restful interface that supports fetching specific data subsets bulk queries visualization and searching by md digests or external database_identifiers we have also developed an html javascript web_application exemplifying how to interact with seqdepot and perl python scripts for use with local processing pipelines availability freely_available on the web at http seqdepot net rest access via http seqdepot net api v database files and scripts may be downloaded from http seqdepot net download primary sequences and their associated features are vital to all bioinformatics_research invariably determining gene and protein_function begins with sequence_similarity followed by identifying intrinsic_features that strictly depend on the sequence itself many computational_tools and libraries exist for elucidating intrinsic_features such as signal_peptides transmembrane_regions protein_domains motifs subcellular_location and structural_elements when considered together and in context these higher_level details synergistically improve the understanding of macromolecular function obtaining such functional details requires building a computational_pipeline that analyzes sequences with the desired toolset and or fetching results from external servers developing a custom pipeline is computationally_expensive moreover predicting intrinsic_features produces the same results for identical_sequences and recomputing this information wastes valuable resources many public resources such as pfam smart and gene d provide precomputed results however significant effort must be exercised to properly map sequence identifiers handle coverage discrepancies and integrate results from independent resources seqdepot addresses the aforementioned issues by consolidating a wide_array of precomputed features across known protein space in a single database seqdepot enables users to rapidly retrieve and process with minimal effort both primary and intrinsic feature data for existing sequences which makes it different from other tools e g interpro that dynamically compute this information for novel sequences interpro and similarity matrix of proteins simap aggregate large masses of precomputed data for classifying all proteins in uniprot into families and calculating all versus all sequence_similarity analyses respectively however simply obtaining and consuming features for a given set of sequences is neither straightforward nor streamlined interpros web_interface permits querying a single_sequence per request or up to per request via web_services if precomputed matches do not exist then the sequences are queued for analysis with interproscan which may take minutes per sequence to complete simap provides several avenues for data access including the web_browser database flat files and most notably via a powerful soap based web_service sequence searches with the web_browser are limited to a single_sequence with a maximum of hits and effectively using soap interfaces requires nontrivial programming exported results e g flat files from both interpro and simap for all predictive tools are merged into a fixed number of fields and necessitate additional parsing logic to disentangle and properly structure the data of interest as high_throughput sequencing_projects exponentially reveal additional sequences researchers are required to analyze larger amounts of sequence_data even with the vast number of databases and web_services available today one must expend considerable time and effort fetching sequences and features installing diverse software_packages generating results restructuring data and even building local databases there remains a compelling need for a single resource that both maps raw sequences to precomputed feature data at scale and is easily queried and to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com processed by both humans and computers seqdepot fills this gap with the overarching goals of being both comprehensive and extremely simple to use
