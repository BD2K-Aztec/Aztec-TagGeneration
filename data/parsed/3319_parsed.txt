genetics_and ogarak a population_genetics simulator for malaria motivation the evolution of resistance in plasmodium_falciparum against most available treatments is a major global_health threat population_genetics approaches are commonly used to model the spread of drug_resistance due to uncommon features in malaria biology existing forward time population_genetics simulators cannot suitably model plasmodium_falciparum results here we present ogarak a population_genetics simulator for modelling the spread of drug_resistant malaria ogarak is designed to make malaria simulation computationally_tractable as it models infections not individual parasites ogarak is also able to model the life_cycle of the parasite which includes both haploid and diploid phases and sexual and asexual reproduction we also allow for the simulation of different inbreeding levels an important difference between high and low_transmission areas and a fundamental factor_influencing the outcome of strategies to control or eliminate malaria malaria is a major public_health as one third of the human population is estimated to be exposed to the threat of the most virulent species plasmodium_falciparum antimalarial drug_resistance has emerged as one of the major challenges_facing malaria_control drug_resistance became widespread to most firstline therapies and treatment_failures are now being observed for their replacements artemisinin combination_therapies acts mathematical and computational_models of the spread of drug_resistance are an important tool to understand the emergence and spread of drug_resistance most mathematical and computational modelling of malaria have been based on epidemiology e g or population_genetics e g though complex simulation_models have also been developed while many forward time population_genetics simulators do exist e g they are not suitable to model malaria therefore all existing computational studies using a population_genetics approach are based on applications and scripts to whom correspondence should be addressed developed for each study and not directly subjected to peer_review or publicly_available standard individual based forward time population_genetics simulators are not suitable to model malaria biology for two main reasons i population_size in malaria can rise up to parasites per human_host making it computationally infeasible to simulate all individuals and ii the malaria life_cycle includes both haploid and diploid phases and most existing simulators do not allow for the modelling of different genotypic structures over time in order to address_these we developed ogarak a population_genetics simulator designed to study the spread of drug_resistance in p falciparum_malaria ogarak is able to easily simulate most existing population_genetics models studying the spread of drug_resistance in malaria it is made available as a public framework which can be used to evaluate new models or re use old ones for new analysis for instance it was already used and tested to research the impact of epistasis on linkage_disequilibrium between loci involved in drug_resistance and can also simulate from a population_genetics perspective promising drug deployment strategies we focused on modelling how resistance spreads and not de_novo emergence given that emergence is a rare event and that it is already widespread to most drugs therefore making the management of existing resistance a major_concern nonetheless ogarak supports mutation therefore permitting the study of de_novo emergence while ogarak was developed with malaria modelling in mind epistasis and spacial and temporal selection patterns have clear parallels with some known models in sex theory as temporal selection heterogeneity is the fundamental concept behind the red_queen hypothesis and spacial selection heterogeneity has also been proposed as one explanation for sex and recombination ogarak can therefore be used to easily simulate and test some models relevant to sex theory ogarak can serve as a framework to more easily evaluate drug deployment policies and help enhance the understanding of fundamental variables underlying the spread of drug_resistant malaria
