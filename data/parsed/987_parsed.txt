c it loci a knowledge database for tissue enriched loci motivation increasing evidences suggest that most of the genome is transcribed into rnas but many of them are not translated into proteins all those rnas that do not become proteins are called non_coding ncrnas which outnumbers protein_coding interestingly these ncrnas are shown to be more tissue specifically expressed than protein_coding given that tissue_specific expressions of transcripts suggest their importance in the expressed tissue researchers are conducting biological_experiments to elucidate the function of such ncrnas owing greatly to the advancement of next generation techniques especially rna_seq the amount of high_throughput data are increasing rapidly however due to the complexity of the data as well as its high volume it is not easy to re analyze such data to extract tissue_specific expressions of ncrnas from published datasets results here we introduce a new knowledge database called c it loci which allows a user to screen for tissue specific_transcripts across three organisms human mouse and zebrafish c it loci is intuitive and easy to use to identify not only protein_coding but also ncrnas from various tissues c it loci defines homology through sequence and positional conservation to allow for the extraction of species conserved loci c it loci can be used as a starting_point for further biological_experiments a series of articles by functional_annotation of mammalian_genome fantom projects encyclopedia of dna elements encode consortium and others clearly indicate that a majority of genome is transcribed in the form of rnas yet only few percentages of them fall under the category of protein_coding the current estimate is that less than of the mammalian genome_encodes for protein_coding previously many of the remaining rnas were discarded as transcriptional noises and experimental_errors however through the discovery of micrornas mirnas and other non_coding ncrnas e g long_non lncrnas it became evident that rnas have functions beyond templates for protein expression the concept of ncrnas is not new as ribosomal_rnas rrnas and transfer rnas trnas do not encode for proteins but are necessary for protein_translation given such a complex reality of transcriptomes lncrnas are an immensely important topic of studyfor understanding biological_systems furthermore they are of major interest in medicine with a huge range of potential applications from the detection of neurological_diseases and treatments anticancer_therapies and even cardiac regeneration however compared to protein_coding the functions of lncrnas are poorly_understood one of the major reasons is that lncrnas exhibit low sequence_conservation making evolutionary comparison difficult indeed a recent study using a computational_pipeline for homologybased comparison found that only of lncrnas share sequence_conservation between human and other non marsupial mammals compared to of protein_coding between human and mice although lncrnas are poorly conserved among species their expression_patterns are distinct compared to those of protein_coding as a majority of lncrnas both with high and low sequence_conservation is expressed in a tissue specific_manner furthermore when a set of highly_conserved lncrnas was examined their tissue expressions are conserved between species since it is highly unlikely that the level of convergent_evolution has occurred to allow for the specificity of lncrnas when comparing to their poor sequence_conservation it is possible that evolutionary_pressure is effective but not on a sequence specific_manner which might suggests a sequence_independent way to understand the conservation of lncrnas is necessary indeed a number of methods have already been explored one is based on the observation that the secondary_structures of a number of lncrnas are conserved however a large_scale attempt using such methodology is still impeded by poor understanding of secondary_structures of rna in general other studies have observed that promoter_regions of lncrnas are relatively conserved even when compared to those of protein_coding although defining species_conservation via promoters is valuable recent_evidences from chromatin conformational capture assays e g c c hi c suggest that a promoter and enhancer could be up to kb from the transcription_start tss of a gene to control its expression if this applies to the mammalian_genome it would be difficult to define which region is controlling the expression of one gene but not the other to overcome these challenges in this study we introduced positional conservation based on the idea that certain regions of the genome are conserved from one species to another this region is defined as a pair of adjacent genes which share adjacency and homology when compared across another species applying this concept to three organisms human mouse and zebrafish we built a knowledge database called c it loci http c it loci uni frankfurt de using published rna_seq from various studies_covering different tissues using c it loci we revisited the idea of tissue_specificity of protein_coding and lncrnas furthermore we examined the definition of housekeeping_genes and applied its concept to screen for housekeeping lncrnas to show the applicability of c it loci we screened for tissue_specific lncrnas and confirmed their expressions in the target_tissues by surveying publicly_available biological experimental_data in this study we analyzed rna_seq of various tissues from human mouse and zebrafish using the latest genomic assemblies from ensembl we annotated each detected transcripts with detailed biotypes known to the scientific_community to avoid ambiguity currently existing in the field of lncrnas the analyzed datasets can be explored through our c it loci knowledge database which allows users to screen for tissueexpressed enriched and specific_transcripts c it loci was built to assist researchers with a limited knowledge about analysis of rnaseq_data as well as bioinformatics and computational programs an easy to use quick search function is provided at the top page of c itloci so that users can perform an in silico screening of transcripts that are expressed enriched and or specific by comparing up to two tissues as an output of such in silico screening easy to view venn diagrams are provided for conserved_regions and transcripts for protein_coding and lncrnas separately these venn diagrams are clickable which jumps to the table that lists all the identified conserved_regions or transcripts from this table users can explore the detailed information about each entry in the detailed information page for conserved_region gene or transcript ensembl id is provided along with an official gene name and symbol genomic_position and biotype furthermore link out to ensembl_database and the ucsc_genome are provided within the same page genome_browser is implemented so that users can visually inspect the location of the identified gene and its corresponding transcripts i e isoforms in addition a heat map is provided to examine the expression_patterns of the identified gene and its isoforms a tab is implemented to view only for those expressed tissues as well as numerical fpkm values are provided in the table format in the case of the identified gene that follows under conserved_regions a list of conserved_regions and their region types are provided along with the links to the corresponding information since gene_ontology are often used in the research_community to categorize protein_coding go terms are provided along with the link to the corresponding information page provided by amigo there are many databases available that contain expressions of protein_coding across various tissues including our own c it knowledge database in the case of lncrnas there are three databases available that include the expressions of lncrnas across tissues namely lncrnamap lncrnator and noncode lncrnamap is limited to human lncrnas and provides a link out to the ucsc_genome for expression data whereas lncrnator and noncode include more species of these three databases lncrnator includes the most amount of next_generation datasets including rna_seq compared to these databases our c it loci differs in the following points first the latest genomic assembly for human hg is utilized whereas all the other databases are based on hg which was released in february and numerous transcripts are not included or ambiguously annotated supplementary second c it loci allows an in silico screening of tissue expressed enriched and specific_transcripts by comparing two tissues whose function is missing in all other databases supplementaryis provided to give an overview of tissue specific_transcripts in each tissue such information can only be obtained through c it loci which would be valuable to conduct loss of function studies to elucidate the functions of such tissue specific_transcripts including yet function unknown lncrnas third c it loci defines homologous lncrnas among three organisms which are not so well defined in all the other databases of note while our study was underway lncipededia which is a database for human lncrnas introduced a similar method of defining homology_based on genomic_position however lncipedia does not provide a list of conserved mouse and zebrafish lncrnas in our c it loci we utilized three types of conserved_regions and provided all the transcripts that follow under each conserved_region of all the databases of proteincoding_genes and lncrnas currently available to the research_community our c it loci is the only database that includes both protein_coding and lncrnas as well as other types of transcripts e g small_nucleolar snornas we anticipate that our c it loci serves as a start point for conducting functional studies in tissue enriched specific_transcripts including lncrnas
