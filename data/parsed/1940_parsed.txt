gc biased gene domains in mammalian_genomes motivation synonymous codon_usage has been shown to be correlated with many genomic_features among different organisms however the biological_significance of codon_bias with respect to gene function and genome_organization remains_unclear results guanine and cytosine content at the third codon position gc could be used as a good indicator of codon_bias here we used relative gc bias values to compare the strength of gc bias of genes in human and mouse we reported for the first time that gc_rich and gc poor gene_products might have distinct sub cellular spatial_distributions moreover we extended the view of genomic gene domains and identified conserved gc biased gene domains along chromosomes our results indicated that similar gc biased genes might be co translated in specific spatial regions to share local translational machineries and that gc could be involved in the organization of genome_architecture availability_and source_code is available upon request from the authors due to the redundancy of the genetic_code most amino_acids can be translated by multiple codons called synonymous codons the frequencies of synonymous_codon vary among different genes within the same and across different organisms this phenomenon is termed synonymous codon_usage scub accumulating_evidence has suggested different mechanisms for scub including mutational pressure and selection etc recent bioinformatics and experimental_studies have shown strong correlations between scub and translation accuracy and speed mrna secondary_structures and stability protein_folding and function and other factors although much effort has been made to explain the mechanisms and biological_roles of scub whether there are some unexplored biological_functions of scub especially with respect to gene function and genome_organization have not yet been elucidated because most synonymous codons differ at only the third nucleotide positions guanine and cytosine content at the third codon position gc is a good indicator of the extent of scub previous_studies that genes with high gc levels may have more sites for dna_methylation exhibit more variable expression and accumulate more mutations than those with low gc levels in several earlier_studies gc has been shown to act as an isochore marker and the relationship between gc and the gc_content of the flanking_regions is still debatable however the distribution of gc biased genes along chromosomes is unknown there are numerous genomic_features related to gc bias here we focused on the genome_wide gene distribution and examined v c the author published_by
