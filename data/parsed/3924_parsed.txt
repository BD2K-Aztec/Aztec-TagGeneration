reasoning with bio ontologies using relational closure rules to enable practical querying motivation ontologies have become indispensable in the life_sciences for managing large_amounts of knowledge the use of logics in ontologies ranges from sound modelling to practical querying of that knowledge thus adding a considerable value we conceive reasoning on bio ontologies as a semi_automated process in three steps i defining a logic_based representation language ii building a consistent ontology using that language and iii exploiting the ontology through querying results here we report on how we have implemented this approach to reasoning on the obo_foundry ontologies within bio gateway a biological resource_description knowledge_base by separating the three steps in a manual_curation effort on metarel a vocabulary that specifies relation semantics we were able to apply reasoning on a large_scale starting from an initial million triples we inferred about million knowledge statements that allow for a myriad of prospective queries potentially leading to new hypotheses about for instance gene_products processes interactions or diseases availability sparul code a query end_point and curated relation types in obo format rdf and owl dl are freely_available www semantic systems_biology org metarel life_sciences researchers become more and more acquainted with ontologies that support the management of knowledge in their research domains many initiatives on biomedical knowledge_management have evolved into large knowledge bases kb some of these consist of an ontology with a rich semantical content like the foundational model of anatomy fma supporting anatomical aspects snomed_ct for medical and clinical terms the gene_ontology go containing cellular information for gene description and the ncbi taxonomy holding a classification of living_organisms other kbs hold a large body of to whom correspondence should be addressed similarly formatted knowledge like uniprot collecting valuable information about proteins and the gene_ontology goa annotating gene_products using the cellular information in go public ontology repositories such as the bioportal at ncbo the ontology lookup service ols and biogateway make ontologies better accessible for scientists through visualizations browse menus and search facilities biologists are beginning to accept formal languages and ontologies as instruments to reach consensus while modelling the knowledge of their interest the large_amounts of data that are generated with high_throughput methods call for such a framework in general a sound framework consists of a common syntax the symbols and language constructs used a common semantics the meaning of the symbols and common modelling practices describing how to use the language ontology a domain in philosophy that has long been trying to describe reality often with the use of logics is strongly stimulated by its fusion with computer science theories that have been developed for over years can now be applied in automated_systems since the last decade of the previous century description logics dl have been developed as decidable fragments of first order logic and some of them with the purpose of efficient reasoning another important evolution in computer science with respect to ontologies is the emergence of the semantic_web and the use of linked data the semantic_web is viewed as a stack of languages and technologies that make knowledge and data on the internet computer intelligible this stands in stark_contrast to the current world_wide which consists of human_readable web_sites on the internet the bottom layer of the semantic_web stack consists of internationalized resource identifiers iri available at http www w org uri iri pressrelease that can identify anything like for instance biomedical concepts on top of iris there is a layer dealing with the syntax called xml extensible markup_language available at http www w org xml in turn followed by a layer of rdf resource_description available at http www w org rdf which is useful for querying and inferring graph_based representations the linked data most of the kbs mentioned above are also provided in rdf the top layer consists of the web_ontology owl available at http www w org tr owl features used for expressing the meaning of knowledge and data in october owl upgraded to owl which distinguishes several dl basedpage we inferred about million knowledge statements through semiautomated reasoning within biogateway the inferences are almost always sound within the intuitive system of all some relations an exception plural forms in every mammalia is some cellular organisms following from an incompatible system for defining terms in the ncbi taxonomy and they can be accessed directly for any term through biogateways most basic lookup query results for api in supplementary_material most of the inferences are rather trivial if they are considered as a single statement however their effect becomes clear to those who are querying the knowledge_base without the inferences certain queries either simply return only a fraction of the answers potentially available in the knowledge sources or they require a lot of very specific knowledge on the architecture of the ontologies in the kb to retrieve full results the reasoning process would need to be done by the query builder and the resulting queries would become huge and slow by pre computing all the inferences the hardest part of the reasoning process happens only once in a single although substantial computational effort but the results are stored and are available for all subsequent queries the query builder can now concentrate solely on the intended meaning of the relation types that are used instead of reconstructing this meaning by his query he can query over the explicit knowledge statements as well as over the implicit ones queries on the rdf graphs with inferred knowledge statements are now short and the answers are more informative and complete imagine a cancer researcher who investigates the aspp proteins apoptosis stimulating of p protein and she finds in direct manual annotations from goa that proteins of this type are located in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm and that they participate in the page bio ontologies and the semantic_web are two important evolutions for knowledge_management in the life_sciences they provide a logical framework universal identifiers and tools for the integration of knowledge however in order to become really useful for life_sciences researchers both pillars need to mature further as the amount of biomedical knowledge keeps growing_exponentially the scalability of semantic web_tools should be a main concern slow queries and memory overflows form a real obstacle for the exploitation of kbs with this work we have chosen to enable efficient querying with the most basic semantic features instead of hampering the query system with advanced fully_automated reasoning the large and diverse possibilities of querying rdf demands better browsing and visualizing tools to make the technology more accessible to biologists some specific tools for browsing biogateway are under construction available at http www semanticsystems biology org biogateway sparql viewer but parameterizing and reworking the sparql code is still the best option for acquiring all the expressivity of the sparql query_language however the direct relations between classes used in biogateway may help overcome some of the current shortcomings pertaining to reasoning and browsing on the side of the development of bio ontologies more efforts are required ontology engineers should reuse other bio ontologies to avoid duplication create appropriate relations provide identifiers synonyms definitions and cross_references the semantic_web architecture is perfectly suited for exploiting an orthogonal crosslinked set of bio ontologies biogateway with logical inferences in place can be used to identify the glitches in obo ontologies as a future work we plan to include more data in biogateway like biological_pathways and to test the biological usefulness of the inferences with in depth queries on very specific research_questions for example the inferences on go and the ncbi taxonomy will allow to compare gene_functions across species and kingdoms many different ontology engineers have collaborated in the coordinated development of more than obo ontology files we have brought consistency to the stack of relation types in these files by gathering all the relation types in biorel and translating them to owl dl after merging the owl translation of biorel with metarel in the rdf store biogateway we could infer million previously hidden knowledge statements from the explicitly asserted knowledge in the obo ontologies goa annotations for about species uniprotkb_swiss and the ncbi taxonomy the inferred knowledge statements can be used for biological hypothesis_generation through querying the success of our methodology is due to the soundness of obo ontologies the use of semantic web_tools and the semi_automated approach of reasoning our work shows that a small set of simple rules for bio ontologies results in efficient practices for reasoning and querying as many researchers are involved in building bio ontologies more restrictive guidelines and principles for building bio ontologies are required in order to obtain more uniformity and reach more convergence for knowledge_management in the life_sciences
