nsimscan dna comparison tool with increased speed sensitivity and accuracy nucleotide similarity scanner nsimscan is specialized for searching massive dna databases for distant similarities its targeted applications include phylogenomics comparative and functional studies of non coding_sequences contamination detection etc nsimscan outper forms industry standard_tools in combined sensitivity accuracy and speed operating at sensitivity similar to blast accuracy of ssearch and speed of megablast availability_and nsimscan is available at https github com abadona qsimscan as a part of qsimscan package it is implemented in c distributed under mit_license and supported on linux os x and windows with cygwin the breakthrough in sequencing_technologies has brought the challenges of dna comparison to a new level driven mainly by clinical_applications efficient tools for ngs_reads mapping have been developed however the search for more distant similarities is still handled by sensitive but slower pre ngs tools or by modern algorithms that provide higher speed at the expense of sensitivity we present nsimscan a tool for fast sensitive and accurate dna similarity_search and demonstrate its performance comparison to industry standard alignment search tools nsimscan was recently successfully employed for ani computing in a large phylogenetic study and we believe that it will be useful for a variety of applications where efficient detection of distant similarities is desired
