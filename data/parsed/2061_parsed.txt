genome_analysis gkaks the pipeline for genome level ka_ks calculation gkaks is a codon based genome level ka_ks computation pipeline developed and based on programs from four widely used packages blat blastall including bl seq formatdb and fas tacmd paml including codeml and yn and kaks calculator including substitution_rate estimation methods gkaks can automatically detect and eliminate frameshift_mutations and premature_stop to compute the substitution_rates ka ks and ka_ks between a well annotated genome and a non annotated genome or even a poorly assembled scaffold dataset it is especially useful for newly_sequenced that have not been well annotated we applied gkaks to estimate the genome_wide substitution_rates in five pairs of closely_related the average ka and ks computed by gkaks were consistent_with we also compared the ka ks and ka_ks of mouse and rat orthologous protein_coding estimated by gkaks and based on the alignments generated by pal nal results from two methods are compatible open_reading orfs are embedded in genomic dna_sequences once detected orf sequences can be aligned at either dna or protein levels because of the degeneracy of genetic codes protein_sequences are more conserved than dna_sequences therefore protein_sequences can be used to compare two orfs with greater evolutionary distance and provide_fundamental biological and evolutionary_information of dna_sequences previously sequence_alignment programs for orfs such as bioperl toolkit revtrans transalign pal nal translatorx and macse use a consecutive three step approach i translation of nucleotide_sequences into protein_sequences ii alignment of protein_sequences and iii alignment of dna_sequences according to protein alignment however this three step alignment approach is highly_sensitive to frameshift and non sense mutations such mutations are common in genomic_datasets and they can be the result of either sequencing_errors or true evolutionary_events leading to loss of function or neo functionalized gene_copies in addition the three step alignment approach also creates a problem when the aligned sequences do not have annotated orfs or homologous_genes have only partial sequences originating from a common_ancestor in this study we present an alternative codon based alignment approach where dna_sequences are directly aligned while also considering codon information codon aware alignment based on blat and bl seq programs automatically aligns coding_sequences cdss from a reference_genome to another genome_sequences deleting the non homologous_sequences such as those existing in a pair of partial duplicated_genes it automatically handles the existence of multiple frameshift_mutations and or early stop_codons in both input dna_sequences after the alignment the pipeline uses codeml yn in paml or other algorithms in kaks calculator to compute the ka ks and ka_ks of the aligned homologous_sequence pairs which can be based on genetic codon models we named the whole pipeline gkaks in terminology of gkaks pipeline ka ks and ka_ks are equivalent to dn ds and dn_ds respectively
