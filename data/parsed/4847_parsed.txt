vasohibins new transglutaminase like cysteine_proteases possessing a non canonical cys his ser catalytic_triad vasohibin and vasohibin regulate angiogenesis tumour_growth and metastasis their molecular_functions however were previously_unknown in large part owing to their perceived lack of homology to proteins of known structure and function to identify their functional amino_acids and domains their molecular activity and their evolutionary_history we undertook an in depth analysis of vasohibin sequences we find that vasohibin proteins are previously un detected members of the transglutaminase like cysteine_protease superfamily and all possess a non canonical cys his ser catalytic_triad we further propose a calcium_dependent activation mechanism for vasohibin proteins these findings can now be used to design constructs for protein structure_determination and to develop enzyme inhibitors as angiogenic regulators to treat me tastasis and tumour_growth tight regulation of angiogenesis contributes to normal_physiology growth and development but when misregulated leads to or dramatically affects pathological_conditions such as ischaemia wound_healing and cancer angiogenesis is a fundamental step in transitioning tumours from benignancy to malignancy the use of angiogenesis inhibitors in treating_cancer has thus received considerable attention over the last four decades vasohibin vash was initially identified as a vascular_endothelial inducible gene that regulates endothelial_cell despite lacking a classical secretion signal human vash protein is released extracellularly assisted by a small vasohibin binding_protein which is the only known vash interacting_protein over expression of a paralogue vasohibin vash is associated with diverse tumours with major roles to angiogenesis malignant_transformation and metastasis knockout_mouse studies have revealed the contrasting roles of the two paralogues vash is expressed in endothelial_cells in zones within which angiogenesis is arrested whilst vash is expressed in infiltrating_mononuclear at the sprouting front in which angiogenesis is enhanced the molecular activity of neither paralogue is known in large part due to a perceived lack of homology to proteins of known structure and function given the strong statistical_significance of sequence and profile comparisons and the concordance of secondary_structure and conserved active_site we have shown that vasohibin proteins are new members of the transglutaminase like cysteine_protease superfamily and possess a non canonical cys his ser_thr catalytic_triad this insight should immediately help guide experiments to clarify the molecular_mechanisms by which vash and vash control angiogenesis
