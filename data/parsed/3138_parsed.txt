mugsy fast multiple_alignment of closely_related whole genomes motivation the relative_ease and low_cost of current_generation sequencing_technologies has led to a dramatic_increase in the number of sequenced_genomes for species across the tree of life this increasing volume of data requires tools that can quickly compare multiple whole genome_sequences millions of base_pairs in length to aid in the study of populations pan genomes and genome_evolution results we present a new multiple alignment_tool for whole genomes named mugsy mugsy is computationally_efficient and can align streptococcus_pneumoniae genomes in less than hours producing alignments that compare favorably to other tools mugsy is also the fastest program evaluated for the multiple_alignment of assembled human_chromosome sequences from four individuals mugsy does not require a reference_sequence can align mixtures of assembled draft and completed genome data and is robust in identifying a rich complement of genetic_variation including duplications rearrangements and large_scale gain and loss of sequence availability mugsy is free open_source available from http mugsy sf net there are numerous sequenced_genomes from organisms spanning across the tree of life this number of genomes is expected to continue to grow dramatically in coming_years due to advances in sequencing_technologies and decreasing costs for particular populations of interest many individual_genomes will be sequenced to study genetic_diversity the cancer_genome genomes_project and the personal genome_project will generate genome_sequences from at least several thousand people for bacterial_genomes there are already over one thousand complete bacterial_genomes in public_databases often a pan_genome concept is needed to describe a species or population requiring multiple sequenced_genomes from the same species there are already nine bacterial_species with ten or more sequenced_genomes in a recent version of refseq hundreds of individual sequenced_genomes are expected for some medically relevant to whom correspondence should be addressed species and model_organisms such as escherichia_coli many of these genomes will be in the form of draft_genomes where the sequencing_reads are assembled into numerous contigs that together represent a fraction of the actual genome but are incomplete and contain physical sequencing gaps in order to make use of this explosive_growth in the number of sequenced_genomes the scientific_community requires tools that can quickly compare large_numbers of long and highly_similar sequences from whole genomes whole_genome alignment has become instrumental for studying genome_evolution and genetic_diversity there are a number of whole_genome alignment tools that can align multiple whole genomes whole_genome alignment tools are distinguished from collinear multiple_sequence tools such as tools of in that they can align very long_sequences millions of base_pairs in length detecting the presence of rearrangements duplications and large_scale sequence gain and loss the resulting alignments can be utilized to build phylogenies determine orthology find recently duplicated regions and identify species specific dna for divergent sequences alignment_accuracy is difficult to assess and popular_methods can disagree such was demonstrated by the relatively low_level of agreement between outputs for the encode regions given the difficulties in assessing accuracy recent development has included methods that are statistically motivated and show improved specificity at shorter evolutionary_distances with large fractions of identical_sequences there is less ambiguity in alignment outcomes yet even within a bacterial_species aligning multiple_genomes is not a trivial task especially if the sequences contain rearrangements duplications and exhibit sequence gain and loss also despite relatively short chromosome lengths for bacteria typically a few million base_pairs the computational_complexity of multiple_sequence makes it a formidable challenge calculation of multiple_alignments with a simple sum of pairs scoring_scheme is known to be an np_hard which makes calculation of an exact solution infeasible for large inputs multiple genome alignment tools rely on heuristics to achieve reasonable run times there are numerous methods to compare a single pair of wholegenome sequences the nucmer and mummer package is a fast whole_genome alignment_method that utilizes a suffix_tree to seed an alignment with maximal unique matches mums the suffix_tree implementation of mummer is especially efficient and can be bothwe introduce mugsy a new multiple whole_genome alignment_tool that does not require a reference_genome and can align mixtures of complete and draft_genomes using current_generation sequencing_technologies a majority of newly_sequenced are expected to be draft_genomes represented by multiple contigs after assembly mugsy can identify sequence_conservation and variation in any subset of these inputs the primary advantage of mugsy over similar tools is speed mugsy is able to align e coli genomes mb in day on a single_cpu and s pneumoniae genomes in h mugsy was also the fastest tool evaluated for the alignment of four assembled human_chromosomes completing the lcb identification and multiple_alignment in h provided a library of pairwise_alignments mugsy and tba were the only tools evaluated that completed alignments of four human_chromosomes and e coli genomes in days of processing time on a single_cpu on smaller datasets of closely_related genomes we found agreement between alignments generated by mugsy mauve and tba the primary difference was the number and boundaries of the aligned regions our work relies heavily on two open_source software_packages the suffix_tree based pairwise aligner nucmer and the segment based alignment approach of seqan tcoffee we utilized nucmer to quickly build a library of pairwise homology across all input genomes our work extends methods in seqan tcoffee to accommodate wholegenome multiple_alignment with rearrangements and duplications mugsy implements a new procedure that identifies lcbs the graph utilized for the lcb identification and segment based multiple_alignment is compact for highly conserved_sequences allowing for efficient computation this makes mugsy especially well suited to classification of species pan genomes and other intra species comparisons where there is a high degree of sequence_conservation alignment of many large highly conserved_sequences such as human_chromosomes is likely to become increasingly popular as improvements in sequencing and assembly technologies allow for de_novo of human_genomes including assembly of haplotypes mugsy relies on a number of parameters including minimum mum length in nucmer and the lcb chaining parameters careful choice of parameters is likely to be important for alignments at longer evolutionary_distances automatically determining parameters or providing user guidance on parameter choice is an area that needs improvement also for more divergent genomes the performance advantages of the segment based alignment approach decrease as the length of the conserved segments shorten and the size of the alignment graph grows the alignment of e coli_strains required slightly gb of ram to build and process the alignment graph the larger memory requirement of mugsy on more divergent genomes is a limitation of the tool and an area that we may be able to improve at the expense of longer runtimes as biologists continue to explore the rich genetic_diversity of the biosphere thousands of genomes may soon be available for some species and the ability to read genetic_information is outpacing the speed at which we can analyze the data for meaningful relationships mugsy attempts to address this performance gap but additional algorithm development is needed the alignment of hundreds or more even relatively small bacterial_genomes remains a formidable challenge and may limit the use of the growing amounts of whole_genome data by biologists as desktop computers are now commonly available with multiple cpus parallel processing using multiple cpus is a readily available technique to improve runtimes the pairwise_alignment phase of mugsy and multiple_alignment of each lcb are easily parallelized and well suited to run on multicpu cores or compute clusters we plan to extend mugsy to support parallel processing to enable alignment of even larger datasets whole_genome alignment incorporates sequence_identity and synteny and is well suited to aiding annotation of orthologous_genes and pan genomes we also plan to add support for deriving these features from the output of whole_genome alignments as future work
