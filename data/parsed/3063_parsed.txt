gene_expression modular analysis of gene_expression data with r large sets of data such as expression_profiles from many samples require analytic tools to reduce their complexity the iterative signature algorithm isa is a biclustering algorithm it was designed to decompose a large set of data into so_called modules in the context of gene_expression data these modules consist of subsets of genes that exhibit a coherent expression_profile only over a subset of microarray_experiments genes and arrays may be attributed to multiple modules and the level of required coherence can be varied resulting in different resolutions of the modular mapping in this short note we introduce two bioconductor software_packages written in gnu r the isa package includes an optimized implementation of the isa and the eisa package provides a convenient interface to run the isa visualize its output and put the biclusters into biological_context potential users of these packages are all r and bioconductor users dealing with tabular e g gene_expression data the isa can be applied to identify coherent substructures i e modules from any rectangular matrix of data to be specific we consider here the case of transcriptomics_data corresponding to a set of gene_expression from a collection of samples the method has been described in detail in here we only give a brief summary the isa identifies modules by an iterative procedure the algorithm starts from an input seed corresponding to some set of genes or samples which is refined at each iteration by adding and or removing genes and or samples until the process converges to a stable set which is referred to as a transcription module the output of isa is a collection of potentially overlapping modules every module contains genes that are over and or under expressed in samples that belong to the module in every module each gene and each sample is attributed a score between and which reflects the strength of the association with the module moreover if the scores of two genes of a module have the same sign then they are correlated across the samples of the module opposite signs mean anti correlation similarly if two sample scores have the same sign then these samples are correlated across the genes of the module opposite signs indicate anti correlation to whom correspondence should be addressed
