rarevariantvis new tool for visualization of causative variants in rare monogenic_disorders using whole_genome sequencing_data the search for causative genetic_variants in rare_diseases of presumed monogenic inheritance has been boosted by the implementation of whole exome wes and whole_genome wgs sequencing in many cases wgs seems to be superior to wes but the analysis and visual ization of the vast_amounts of data is demanding results to aid this challenge we have developed a new toolrarevariantvisfor analysis of genome sequence_data including non coding_regions for both germ_line and somatic variants it visualizes variants along their respective chromosomes providing information about exact chromosomal position zygosity and frequency with point and click information regarding dbsnp ids gene association and variant inheritance rare_variants as well as de_novo variants can be flagged in different colors we show the performance of the rarevariantvis tool in the genome in a bottle wgs data_set the main functionalities of the rarevariantvis package are variant filtering and visualization of rare_variants and regions of homozygosity for overview see supplementary a unique option in rarevariantvis as compared to other genome visualization_tools is presentation of rare_variants and clusters of them characteristic for a particular sample the chromosomevis for a single sample triovis for trio samples and multiplevis for multiple samples functions filter all variants within the sequence of a given chromosome and keep non synonymous coding ones as default in addition filters for dbsnp frequency default value and sequencing_coverage default threshold for read_depth are applied variants that pass these filters are considered rare non synonymous coding variants in addition users can filter variants by adding their own list of variant positions to be excluded the chromosomevis function provides a visualization of all variants along a particular chromosome with the corresponding frequency of the alternative allele indicated as small blue dots this allele_frequency can be computed as the ratio of the number of alternative variant reads to all reads in a particular genomic_position allelic_frequency is expected at for heterozygous variants and for homozygous however due to sequencing_errors copy_number and odd coverage the calculated frequency values in practice vary from to the rare non synonymous coding variants that remain after the filtering procedure see above are highlighted as green dots in the example including four that are present in a homozygous state as shown in the tool also includes visualization of the average frequency of the alternative allele of many nearby variants displayed as a moving average of a set frame length default value variants this function can rapidly indicate possible homozygosity regions cut_off value which is often useful information in the genetic_screening of diseases with presumed autosomal_recessive especially if the region also contains rare_variants as displayed in supplementary the package may also point at regions with potential false_positives that occur mainly due to technical_challenges which can be observed as a clustering of numerous rare non synonymous variants in about the same chromosomal position in there are three such regions around positions and mb including two regions in the centromere area that are prone to technical mapping artifacts since centromeres consist of long tandem_repeat stretches the various rarevariantvis functions are also applicable in somatic alterations for example in analysis of cancer_genomes where information about zygosity is essential the triovis function is particularly implemented for discovery of de_novo variants in trio samples and can also be useful in autosomal_recessive and dominant cases supplementary figs s and s the visualization is dynamic so that pointing at the variants will lead to display of an instant text box with information about the gene position and inheritance i e whether the variant has been inherited from mother father or both of parents the user may also mark and zoom on variants of interest potential de_novo variants are flagged and visualized in red
