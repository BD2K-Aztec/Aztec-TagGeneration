sequence_analysis protein signature based estimation of metagenomic abundances including all domains of life and viruses motivation metagenome analysis requires tools that can estimate the taxonomic abundances in anonymous sequence_data over the whole range of biological_entities because there is usually no prior_knowledge about the data composition not only all domains of life but also viruses have to be included in taxonomic_profiling such a full range approach however is difficult to realize owing to the limited coverage of available reference data in particular archaea and viruses are generally not well represented by current genome_databases results we introduce a novel approach to taxonomic_profiling of metagenomes that is based on mixture_model analysis of protein signatures our results on simulated_and reveal the difficulties of the existing_methods when measuring achaeal or viral abundances and show the overall good profiling performance of the protein based mixture_model as an application example we provide a large_scale analysis of data from the human_microbiome this demonstrates the utility of our method as a first instance profiling tool for a fast estimate of the community_structure metagenomics has significantly_enhanced the exploration of the biological_diversity on our planet shotgun_sequencing of environmental_dna has provided a wealth of data for the analysis of the taxonomic and functional composition of a broad range of microbial_communities to make sense of the vast amount of sequences novel tools had to be developed that could cope with the anonymous and fragmented nature of metagenomic_data in particular to answer the classical who is there question several specific problems have to be addressed the short_length of sequence_fragments the insufficient phylogenetic coverage of current genome_databases and the computational expense of the underlying algorithms are still limiting_factors in taxonomic_profiling of metagenomes today because we usually have no a priori_knowledge about the composition of a metagenome a taxonomic profiling_method in principle must be able to cover all three domains of life to encompass the whole spectrum of possible biological_sources besides bacteria archaea and eukaryota also viral entities have to be considered a major_problem of such a full range taxonomic_analysis arises from the limited coverage of genome_databases that provide the required reference data for the characterization of novel sequences in particular archaea and viruses are generally not well represented by current database genomes making_it to obtain realistic estimates of the corresponding abundances the existing_methods for taxonomic_profiling can be divided_into homology_based and model based_approaches among the homology based_approaches most methods rely on a blast similarity_search of metagenomic_sequences against a genomic reference_database e g in this case the phylogenetic classification of sequences is derived from the taxonomic labels of those reference_sequences with a significant similarity this in principle enables the measurement of the proportions of bacterial archaeal eukaryotic and viral_sequences to reduce the computational_cost of the homology_search step the analysis can be restricted to certain signature or marker_genes however in the latter case the estimation of viral abundances is complicated by the fact that there are no universal marker_genes for viruses model based_approaches build a taxon dependent in most cases organism specific feature representation of reference_genomes that is used for the analysis of metagenomic_sequences currently all methods rely on features derived from the oligonucleotide frequencies of the taxonomically labeled reference_genomes e g which are therefore often termed as composition based_methods while in the case of homology based_methods the computational_cost for taxonomic_profiling increases with the number of reference_sequences for model based_approaches the cost just increases with the number of represented taxons a good profiling accuracy of model based_methods has been reported for microbial metagenomes that mainly comprise bacterial_dna e g recently also the profiling of metagenomes with a substantial fraction of eukaryotic dna has been addressed and promising results have been reported however to our knowledge there is no systematic study that investigates the ability of model based_approaches to measure the fraction of viral_dna conceptually it is not clear whether unique viral oligonucleotide signatures exist that make them generally distinguishable from microbial signatures besides a possible host adaptation there is no reason why viruses should to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work exhibit a typical codon_usage or oligonucleotide profile the only model based tool that explicitly includes viral reference data is nbc however as outlined by the authors the nbc tool should not be used with mixed reference_databases of for example viral and prokaryotic models because of a preference of nbc estimates for longer genomes thus nbc virus models are not meant to supplement the microbial models for full range taxonomic_profiling and should therefore only be applied to pure virus data where no microbial_contamination is anticipated we here present the taxy pro method as the first modelbased taxonomic_profiling approach that uses protein signatures instead of the commonly used oligonucleotide signatures the features of these protein signatures comprise the frequencies of protein_domain according to the pfam_database because it does not make sense to estimate the protein signature of a single short sequence we do not perform a classification of metagenomic_reads by means of these protein features instead we make use of a mixture_model for taxonomic_profiling that has been introduced for oligonucleotide based profiling of metagenomes for mixture modeling of protein signatures we aim to reconstruct the overall pfam_domain frequencies of a metagenome by a linear combination of genomic reference signatures pfam_domain hits have also been used as a basis for taxonomic_profiling by the carma and treephyler tools however these tools do not analyze the overall domain frequencies but perform a computationally_expensive phylogenetic classification of each sequence with a pfam hit based on a multiple_alignment with the pfam reference_sequences in the evaluation of taxy pro we show that the protein based mixture_model provides important_advantages when compared with the oligonucleotide based model we observed a higher accuracy of taxy pro in the quantification of archaeal dna where the narrow spectrum of available database genomes requires a good generalization of the profiling_method in addition we demonstrate that protein based models can be built from viral metagenomes to obtain realistic estimates of the virus fraction our results indicate a strikingly higher sensitivity of the extended taxy pro mixture_model when compared with homology_based classification methods merely based on genomic reference data using the domain frequencies as obtained from the comet web_server computation is about three orders_of than a speed optimized blast_analysis that includes viral metagenome sequences as reference data because of this computational_efficiency we were able to perform a large_scale analysis of sequence_data from the human_microbiome hmp without using a computer cluster or special hardware in agreement with previous hmp studies e g we found that archaea are not among the abundant organisms in any of the samples however we observed a significant eukaryotic fraction in some samples which has not been reported in the original studies we have shown that the functional profile of a metagenome in terms of the overall protein domain frequencies can be used to infer its taxonomic_composition over the whole range of biological_entities in our evaluation we demonstrated the difficulties of the existing_tools in providing full range estimates that include the proportions of all domains of life and viruses in particular a reliable estimation of archaeal and viral fractions constitutes a major_challenge for taxonomic_profiling tools considering the coverage of current genome_databases we found that it is necessary to include reference data from viral metagenomes to obtain realistic estimates of the virus fraction our results indicate that the restriction to genomic reference data in current taxonomic_profiling tools leads to systematic underestimation of the virus fraction for that reason a large number
