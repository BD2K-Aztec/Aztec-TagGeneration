genetics_and dical ibd demography aware inference of identity by descent tracts in unrelated_individuals we present a tool dical ibd for detecting identity by descent ibd_tracts between pairs of genomic_sequences our method builds on a recent demographic inference_method based on the coalescent with recombination and is able to incorporate demographic_information as a prior simulation_study shows that dical ibd has significantly_higher recall and precision than that of existing single nucleotide polymorphismbased ibd detection methods while retaining reasonable accuracy for ibd_tracts as small as cm availability http sourceforge net_projects the notion of identity by descent ibd between distantly_related individuals is playing an increasing role in a variety of genetic_analyses including association_mapping inferring past demographic_history and detecting signals of natural_selection currently there exist several useful methods for detecting ibd_tracts these methods are based on characterizing similar haplotypes e g germline or considering patterns of linkage_disequilibrium e g fastibd refined ibd and ibdseq b but they do not explicitly_model genealogical relationships between genomic_sequences here we present a new ibd detection tool dical ibd which is based on a well used genealogical process in population_genetics namely the coalescent with recombination another feature that distinguishes our method is that we can incorporate demographic_information as a prior there seems to be no universally_accepted definition of ibd the definition we adopt is the same as that inand ralph and coop specifically an ibd tract is defined as a maximally contiguous genomic_region that is wholly descended from a common_ancestor without any recombination occurring within the region in contrast to other methods we allow ibd_tracts to contain point_mutations which are likely to occur in humans due to comparable mutation and recombination_rates dical ibd is able to detect ibd_tracts with high_accuracy in unrelated_individuals between whom the vast_majority of shared tracts are cm single_nucleotide snp based_methods are successful in detecting tracts cm but have low power for shorter tracts whereas sequence_based methdods such as dical ibd and ibdseq maintain reasonable accuracy for tracts as small as cm
