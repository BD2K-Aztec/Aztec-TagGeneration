data_and chemmapper a versatile web_server for exploring pharmacology and chemical_structure association based on molecular d similarity method chemmapper is an online platform to predict polypharma cology effect and mode of action for small_molecules based on d similarity computation chemmapper collects chemical_structures with bioactivities and associated target annotations as well as non annotated compounds for virtual_screening taking the user provided chemical_structure as the query the top most similar compounds in terms of d similarity are returned with associated pharmacology annotations chemmapper is designed to provide versatile services in a variety of chemogenomics drug repur posing polypharmacology novel bioactive_compounds identification and scaffold_hopping studies recent_advances in systems_biology and chemical_biology exhibit great challenges to the current drug_discovery paradigm that drugs selectively bind with one or two targets and show that most drugs interact with multiple_targets namely polypharmacology on the other hand identification of new hit compounds and optimization of lead_compounds targeting specific proteins or exhibiting desired pharmacological_effects are still playing_a in conventional drug_discovery projects in the form of virtual_screening and scaffold_hopping in this context there is an urgent request for developing new strategies to acquire knowledge of the complete pharmacology profile and bridge the chemical and pharmacological spaces to improve the success_rates of current drug_discovery including reducing the side_effects and increasing the regulatory_effects on the complete networks one of the emerging scenarios to address_this is the application of molecular similarity searching on basis of the wellknown similar property principle namely similar structures may have similar bioactivity and the same potential_drug which is expected to relate the pharmacology space by chemical structural_similarity information according to this principle small_molecule similarity had been used to identify off targets for a long period the d similarity methods have been widely used in various online tools like similarity ensemble approach sea superpred and chemprot which relate protein pharmacology and disease networks by fingerprint based ligand similarity and ftreesweb which adopts graph_theory to encode molecular d descriptions to perform virtual_screening against large chemical databases also numerous online servers using d similarity methods are also emerging like superimpose superimpose which provides two different d superimposition algorithms and three different databanks for screening and wwligcsrre which is built on top of csr algorithm that searches for the maximal common substructure between two sets of unordered coordinates to screen focused chemical libraries recently a direct comparison of d and d methods for on and off target prediction reveals that the benefit of d over d was obvious for prediction of polypharmacology and drug pairs that shared high d similarity but low d similarity i e a novel scaffold were shown to be much more likely to exhibit pharmacologically_relevant differences in terms of specific protein target modulation herein we present a versatile web_based chemmapper for exploring target pharmacology and chemical relationships against any given small_molecules via shafts a fast d similarity method in which the d similarity calculation is driven by the hybrid information of molecular_shape and chemotype features chemmapper assembles a large repertoire of bioactive chemical database annotated with target information and multiple screening databases from different catalogs of the chemical vendors it facilitates identification to whom correspondence should be addressed
