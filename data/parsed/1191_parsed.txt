cpgassoc an r function for analysis of dna_methylation microarray_data with the increasing availability of high_density methylation microarrays there has been growing interest in analysis of dna_methylation data we have developed cpgassoc an r package that can efficiently perform the statistical_analysis needed for increasingly_large methylation datasets cpgassoc is a modular expandable package with functions to perform rapid analyses of dna_methylation data via fixed or mixed_effects to perform basic quality_control to carry out permutation_tests and to display results via an array of publication quality plots
