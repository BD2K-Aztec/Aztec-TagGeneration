genome_wide identification and predictive_modeling of tissue_specific alternative_polyadenylation motivation pre_mrna cleavage and polyadenylation are essential steps for end maturation and subsequent stability and degradation of mrnas this process is highly_controlled by cis_regulatory surrounding the cleavage polyadenylation_sites polya_sites which are frequently constrained by sequence content and position more than of human transcripts have multiple functional polya_sites and the specific use of alternative polya_sites apa results in isoforms with variable untranslated_regions thus potentially affecting gene_regulation elucidating the regulatory mechanisms_underlying differential polya preferences in multiple cell_types has been hindered both by the lack of suitable data on the precise location of cleavage_sites as well as of appropriate tests for determining apas with significant differences across multiple libraries results we applied a tailored paired_end protocol to specifically probe the position of polya_sites in three human adult tissue_types we specified a linear effects regression_model to identify tissue specific_biases indicating regulated apa the significance of differences between tissue_types was assessed by an appropriately designed permutation_test this combination allowed to identify highly specific_subsets of apa events in the individual tissue_types predictive_models successfully classified constitutive polya_sites from a biologically_relevant background auroc as well as tissue_specific regulated sets from each other we found that the main cis_regulatory described for polyadenylation are a strong and highly informative hallmark for constitutive sites only tissue_specific regulated sites were found to contain other regulatory_motifs with the canonical polyadenylation_signal being nearly absent at brain specific polya_sites together our results contribute to the understanding of the diversity of post_transcriptional availability raw_data are deposited on sra accession_numbers brain srx kidney srx and liver srx processed datasets as well as model code are published on our website almost all eukaryotic mrnas undergo a post_transcriptional processing step called polyadenylation in which they acquire a polya tail at their end after transcription the most segment of the newly made rna is cleaved off at specific sites polya_sites by a set of rna regulatory_proteins which is followed by the synthesis of the polya tail by the addition of adenine a residues in a non templated fashion around protein factors regulate this process with cpsf cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor cstf cleavage simulator factor cfi cleavage factor i cfii cleavage factor ii pap polya polymerase and pabii polya binding_protein playing a crucial_role polya_sites are essential for end maturation stability and degradation of mrnas furthermore polyadenylation defines the extent of the untranslated_region utr of mrnas which spans from the stop_codon up to the polya tail and contains many post_transcriptional sequence_elements such as microrna mirna_target in addition alternative_polyadenylation apa events arise from the presence of more than one particular functional cleavage polyadenylation polya site the specific use of different polyadenylation_sites can play a direct role in gene_regulation for instance eliminating large_parts of a utr by using the more proximal polya site enables a transcript to escape from mirna regulation of its longer isoform in proliferating_cells proximal polya_sites are therefore favored over distal ones resulting in the production of mrnas with shorter utr and fewer mirna binding_motifs apa can influence mrna nuclear_export cytoplasmic_localization and non mirna mediated changes in mrna_stability and translational_efficiency as such it is important to identify not just alternative but specifically regulated alternative events such as tissue_specific apa based on earlier analysis of expressed_sequence ests over of the human and more than of mouse genes were observed to have multiple polyadenylation_sites which results in mrna isoforms different in their utr and or coding_sequences initial studies on ests and tiling microarrays also indicated a bias in the regulation of polya_sites in certain human tissues the introduction of high_throughput has vastly expanded the opportunities to explore apa recent deep_sequencing of mrna populations from multiple tissue_types has shown that of human genes exhibit variants due to apa sites in addition several protocols relevant for studying polyadenylation have been developed to whom correspondence should be addressed the

the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup comthese protocols are designed to capture the end of mrnas using specific_primers then sequence these fragments using second and third_generation however with one exception these approaches have been applied on small samples or nonmammalian genomes leaving human normal_tissues unexplored a thorough analysis of the polyadenylation process in adult tissue_types showing differential_gene would help us understand tissue_specific apa regulation although genomewide apa profiling enables us to discover genes with multiple polya isoforms at a genome_wide scale it introduces major challenges without adequate methodology to specify the significance of apa biases in different tissues we may confuse the mere presence of multiple apa with their specific up or downregulation across conditions a clean definition of truly specific sets is necessary to investigate which features allow for successful discrimination via computational_models and to suggest candidate regulatory_features for future_studies in this article we address several of these challenges by using data from a new rna_seq protocol applied to sequence the utr end of mrnas from different adult normal tissue_types using a linear_model we distinguish between constitutive alternative and alternatively regulated polyadenylation_sites our linear_regression takes_into different library depth expression of each gene in each tissue as well as interactions between tissues and genes as is still the case with many deep sequencing_datasets we do not have multiple replicates at our disposition that can be used to identify significantly differing apas across tissues instead significance of differences between samples from different tissue_types is assessed by an appropriately designed permutation_test we then use the flanking_sequence region around polya_sites to build predictive_models both for the discrimination of constitutive polya_sites from genomic background as well as to distinguish between regulated apa sets from different tissues apa is a regulatory_process with major impact on the downstream post_transcriptional fate of affected transcripts yet it has been fairly sparsely investigated recently several studies have analyzed data resulting from new high_throughput protocols and some studies reported on differential preferences for apa usage in some genes from one tissue to another however without a suitable methodology to specify the significance of these events we may confuse alternative with specifically regulated polyadenylation using a high_throughput method particularly designed to probe the mrna end pa seq we were able to accurately identify polya_sites with high_resolution pa seq data from brain liver and kidney were collected and constitutive genes were separated from those having more than one apa isoform given the large_variability of tag counts across genes and coverage across libraries simple tag number thresholds or ratios or information_theoretic metrics such as shannon entropy are not a well suited methodology for deep sequencing_data they drastically inflate the number of putative alternative sites and cannot separate spurious events with little sequence evidence from truly significant ones we therefore designed a suitable statistical_framework to identify tissue_specific events such as apa sites across multiple deep_sequencing libraries using a fixed_effects linear_model and permutation_tests we were able to assign significance_levels to apa usage and identify tissue_specific regulated events our stringent test left us with a highly_specific and suitable dataset to investigate the regulation of alternative apa but led to limited sample_sizes for example the gfer mrna showed two polya_sites with the distal_site being used in brain only similar to the findings in however given its relatively lowread coverage it did not meet our stringent specificity threshold replicate datasets will enable the use of other statistical_tests which will likely detect a larger subset as significantly different and may thus help to identify additional regulatory_elements that are not covered in our examples this study is the first of its kind to analyze_multiple apa sites for a transcript and across more than two conditions we separated constitutive genes from genes with multiple apa sites and examined each group separately our analysis demonstrated that the main cis_regulatory described to be responsible for polyadenylation are a strongand in fact a highly informativehallmark for constitutive sites only studies have shown that of human genes do not have the canonical pas signal and suggested that polyadenylation regulation is directed by non canonical sequences moreover regulation by non canonical sequences is more frequent in genes with apa in specifically regulated subsets in particular brain apa sites we were able to define a highly_enriched motif aaaaaaaaaa starting just downstream of the pas cluster application of meme to the brain specific subset confirmed its significance resulting in an e value of e the canonical polya signal was not observed in brain specific clusters and was found at lower conservation in liver and kidney this agrees with an observation reported in where a polya site did not possess the canonical polya signal instead contained an a rich element in its vicinity an analysis of a different recent polya deep_sequencing dataset also showed a roughly fold enrichment of the a rich motif at brain sites compared with liver and kidney despite being generated by a different protocol and processed by a different pipeline given that the motif is specifically observed in only one tissue within multiple datasets it is unlikely to be an experimental artifact resulting from internal priming but we cautiously point out that it may reflect a property of brain mrnas unrelated to polyadenylation our methodology can be applied to data from additional libraries such as the data generated from applying a highthroughput_sequencing protocol on five mammals this will allow for the definition of specific_subsets and aid in the identification of further candidates of regulatory sequence_features combined with knowledge of regulatory factors_affecting polyadenylation and their expression_patterns this will enable the design of models that can build on the encouraging tissue_specific results we have reported here in summary we have combined high_quality genome_wide data with appropriate downstream_analyses and computational_modeling we have described a successful strategy to identify subsets of significant condition specific polya events built sequencebased models to discriminate between them and identified new candidates for post_transcriptional regulatory_features
