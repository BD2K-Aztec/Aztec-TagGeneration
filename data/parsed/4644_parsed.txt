genome_analysis the strength of intron donor splice_sites in human genes displays a bell_shaped pattern motivation the gene concept has recently changed from the classical one protein notion into a much more diverse picture where overlapping or fused transcripts alternative transcription_initiation and genes within genes add to the complexity generated_by increased understanding of the mechanisms controlling pre_mrna is thus important for a wide_range of aspects relating to gene_expression results we have discovered a convex gene delineating pattern in the strength of intron splice_sites when comparing the strengths of intron containing human genes we found that when analysing them separately according to the number of introns they contain initial splice_sites were always stronger on average than subsequent ones and that a similar reversed trend exist towards the terminal gene part the convex pattern is strongest for genes with up to introns interestingly when analysing the intron containing gene_pool from mouse consisting of genes we found the convex pattern to be conserved despite million years of evolutionary_divergence between the two organisms we also analysed an interesting novel class of chimeric genes which during spliceosome assembly are fused and in tandem are transcribed and spliced into a single mature mrna sequence in their splice_site patterns these genes individually seem to deviate from the convex pattern offering a possible rationale behind their fusion into a single transcript for protein_coding the most significant variety spawning factor is the process responsible for intron removal here the binding_reaction between the highly_conserved u snrna terminus and the pre_mrna intron donor splice_site motif is the first and most crucial step the consensus_sequence of human donor splice_sites the sequence_motif which u snrna recognizes reflects an average complementarity to u snrna to whom correspondence should be addressed the calculation of the free_energy of the base_pairing between the u snrna terminus and donor_site motif has previously been performed as an effective strategy to study binding stability and the strength of donor splice_sites in this analysis we have used the u donor splice_sites motif complementarity to assess the strength of a particular splice_site however many other factors_affect tissue_specific splicing in vivo including splicing enhancers silencers trans_acting acceptor site motifs branch point sequences rna_secondary nucleosome chromatin and isochore features given this additional complexity it is not surprising that we could not find the bell_shaped pattern present in every single human and mouse gene just by investigating one of the contributing_factors the u donor_site association different splicing regulatory_elements compensate for weaker splice_sites in a coevolutionary network additionally as already mentioned above the size of exons and introns correlates with the strength of splice_sites and there is no obvious way to quantitatively assess or make compensation for all these factors in the analysis presented here see supplementaryfor statistics involving splicing enhancers the conclusion from this analysis is that spliced human genes seem to contain on average a delineation trend in the donor splice_sites which may play_a in spliceosome recognition this role may be most significant in the set of genes where the trend is present at the level of single genes of the gene_pool or it may go far beyond that depending on the contributions of the many other splicing site strength influencing_factors mentioned above despite millions of years of divergence mouse genes display the exact same trend the discovery cannot answer the puzzle of spliceosomal intron evolution or why genes are intervened by introns but it highlights an interesting pattern which in very different types of introns both within coding_regions and utrs seem to be subject to similar evolutionary pressures conserving the trend in strength it also suggests a potential future direction for comparative_analysis of spliced genes and gene structure_prediction including splice_site prediction by defining gene categories according to the number of introns they contain
