the genomedata format for storing large_scale functional_genomics data we present a format for efficient storage of multiple tracks of numeric data anchored to a genome the format allows fast random_access to hundreds of gigabytes of data while retaining a small disk_space footprint we have also developed utilities to load data into this format we show that retrieving data from this format is more than times_faster than a naive approach using wiggle files the advent of functional_genomics assays based on next_generation finally allows the high_throughput acquisition of data at bp resolution across entire genomes processing this information however provides a challenge for several orders_of beyond that of previous genomic_analyses and demands new techniques for efficient operation we introduce the genomedata format for genome_scale numerical_data which uses an hdf hierarchical data format http hdfgroup org hdf container for efficient random_access to huge genomic_datasets we also provide a python interface to this format traditional data interchange formats such as the wiggle http genome ucsc edu goldenpath help wiggle html and bedgraph http genome ucsc edu goldenpath help bedgraph html formats provide_excellent means of disseminating genomewide datasets but suffer from several disadvantages in the repeated processing of this data storing numerical_data as ascii text is inefficient and impedes random_access to the data this problem becomes even more apparent when processing the data in scripting languages such as python and r which provide high performance methods for bulk numerical operations on arrays but no method for reading in data in interchange formats quickly it is also necessary to validate this data before use checking that there is exactly one data point per position and that data are not defined outside the boundaries of the underlying sequence genomedata provides anpage
