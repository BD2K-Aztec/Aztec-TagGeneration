gene_expression regulatory impact_factors unraveling the transcriptional_regulation of complex_traits from expression data motivation although transcription_factors tf play a central regulatory_role their detection from expression data is limited due to their low and often sparse expression in order to fill this gap we propose a regulatory impact_factor rif metric to identify critical tf from gene_expression data results to substantiate the generality of rif we explore a set of experiments spanning_a of scenarios including breast_cancer survival fat gonads and sex_differentiation we show that the strength of rif lies in its ability to simultaneously integrate three sources of information into a single measure i the change in correlation existing between the tf and the differentially_expressed de genes ii the amount of differential_expression of de genes and iii the abundance of de genes as a result rif analysis assigns an extreme score to those tf that are consistently most differentially co expressed with the highly abundant and highly de genes rif and to those tf with the most altered ability to predict the abundance of de genes rif we show that rif analysis alone recovers well known experimentally_validated tf for the processes studied the tf identified confirm the importance of ppar signaling in adipose development and the importance of transduction of estrogen signals in breast_cancer survival and sexual_differentiation we argue that rif has universal applicability and advocate its use as a promising hypotheses generating tool for the systematic identification of novel tf not yet documented as critical transcription_factors tf play a central regulatory_role in controlling gene_expression previous_studies that tf are important in both normal and disease_states however low tf expression make their detection challenging and warrants alternative in silico methods to facilitate the identification of critical tf from gene_expression data in an attempt to derive more information from expression data recent work has been devoted to inferring transcriptional
