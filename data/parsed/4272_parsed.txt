sipros prorata a versatile informatics system for quantitative community proteomics sipros prorata is an open_source software_package for end_to data analysis in a wide_variety of community proteomics measurements a database_searching program sipros was developed for accurate general_purpose protein identification and broad range post_translational searches hybrid message_passing openmp parallelism of the new sipros architecture allowed its computation to be scalable from desktops to supercom puters the upgraded prorata performs label_free quantification and isobaric chemical labeling quantification in addition to metabolic_labeling quantification sipros prorata is a versatile informatics system that enables identification and quantification of proteins and their variants in many types of community proteomics_studies availability both programs are freely_available under the gnu gplcommunity proteomics metaproteomics aims to characterize the whole protein complement of a microbial_community in a shotgun approach proteins extracted from environmental_samples of microbial_communities are digested with trypsin into a more complex peptide mixture peptides are then separated by liquid_chromatography and analyzed by tandem_mass ms_ms ms_ms data are searched against translated metagenomic_sequences to identify proteins from different members of a microbial_community post_translational ptms of proteins can be identified computationally by searching an expanded peptide space abundance changes of identified proteins can be measured between different environmental_samples of a microbial_community by quantitative_proteomics common quantification_methods include label_free approaches n metabolic_labeling and isobaric chemical labeling with tmt and itraq here we present a versatile software_package for a wide_range of community proteomics_analysis the package integrates a redesigned and reimplemented sipros program for highly scalable database_searching and an upgraded prorata program for handling all common quantification_methods
