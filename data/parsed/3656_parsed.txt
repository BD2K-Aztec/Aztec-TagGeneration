structural_bioinformatics predicting residue residue_contacts using random_forest models_motivation protein residueresidue contact_prediction can be useful in predicting protein d structures current_algorithms for such a purpose leave room for improvement results we develop proc s a set of random_forest algorithm based models for predicting residueresidue contact_maps the models are constructed based on a collection of non redundant high_resolution protein_structures using sequence_based features a new amino_acid contact propensity matrix and a new set of seven amino_acid groups based on contact preference are developed and used in proc s proc s delivers a fold cross_validated accuracy of with coverage of for top l predictions l is the number of residues in a protein of long_range sequence separation further benchmark tests deliver an accuracy of and coverage of for an independent set of proteins in the recently_completed ninth community_wide experiment on the critical assessment of techniques for protein_structure casp proc s is ranked as no no and no accuracies in the top l l and best predictions of long_range respectively among automatic prediction servers knowing pair_wise protein residueresidue rr contacts can be helpful in predicting d protein_structures because the contact_information can be used to reduce the conformational phase_space while improving the minimum of the landscape funnel of the overall energy function in addition the contacts have been used to construct a scoring_function for protein model_selection currently there are two kinds of approaches for rr contact predictions template based threading and sequence_based machine_learning although template based_approaches can be more accurate than sequence_based ones if proper templates are available they are less useful in ab_initio structure predictions for proteins not having known structure homologs as templates in this work we focus on developing sequence based_algorithms for rr contact predictions to whom correspondence should be addressed numerous sequence_based have been developed using machine_learning such as artificial_neural anns support_vector svms hidden_markov hmm genetic_algorithm ga etc the mean accuracy achieved by state of the art rr predictors is often in the range of suggesting that it remains in need of improvement nevertheless some of these methods have already been put into practical use for example recentlyachieved significant performance improvement of their i tasser server by adding a sequence_based contact_prediction module based on svmseq as results the average tm_score of the i tasser models on the hard targets of the ninth community_wide experiment on the critical assessment of techniques for protein_structure casp was improved by as much as in several cases the tm scores of i tasser models were improved by essentially converting non foldable targets to foldable ones a general procedure of developing sequence_based rr contact predictors includes several steps i constructing a non redundant and comprehensive protein_structure set ii calculating protein and residue properties that may be relevant to contact iii training a model based on a machine_learning algorithm and iv evaluating the performance of the predictive_model therefore improvement can be achieved in one or any combinations of the first three steps a better representative dataset properties more relevant to the rr contacts and a more robust machine_learning algorithm in this work we attempt to improve prediction_accuracy in all three steps we develop statistical_models for predicting rr contact_maps based on the random_forest rf algorithm the training_dataset consists of non redundant protein_structures we use a set of sequence_based features that can be roughly grouped into four categories local window features residue pair features separation segment features and whole protein information in addition to features commonly used in these types of models we introduce a new contact propensity matrix based on a large_scale statistical_analysis we also develop a new set of seven amino_acid groups using a clustering technique to the best of our knowledge proc s is the first rr predictor based on the rf algorithm rf is an ensemble approach that combines many classifiers to achieve a robust classifier rf has been applied in broad classification tasks and has demonstrated good performance it is particularly suitable in classifying high_dimensional and noisy_data one of its advantageous features is that it can handle a mixture of categorical and continuous predictors in addition rf models do not require a time consuming optimization_process and make predictions considerably faster than many other algorithms such as svm in this work we develop proc s a rr contact_map predictor based on the rf algorithm cross_validation and independent_tests demonstrate that the new predictor achieves consistent improvement over its replaced version proc s in addition proc s is ranked as one of the top automatic rr prediction servers participated in casp work is progressing on using feature_selection to find features important to protein rr contacts preliminary_results are encouraging a model using top features ranked by the mean decrease in accuracy measure of rf achieved an accuracy of for top l predictions on d a slight improvement to the accuracy of the model using all features supplementary although the improvement is minimal it proves that it is feasible to use feature_selection to identify features important to protein residue_contacts more important it may help in better understanding the biophysics behind the problem currently we are evaluating several other feature_selection approaches new models will be participating in the upcoming casp experiment in
