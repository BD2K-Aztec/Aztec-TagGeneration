systems_biology selection of human tissue_specific elementary_flux using gene_expression data motivation the analysis of high_throughput molecular data in the context of metabolic_pathways is essential to uncover their underlying functional structure among different metabolic_pathway concepts in systems_biology elementary_flux efms hold a predominant place as they naturally capture the complexity and plasticity of cellular_metabolism and go beyond predefined metabolic maps however their use to interpret high_throughput data has been limited so_far mainly because their computation in genome_scale has been unfeasible to face this issue different optimization based techniques have been recently_introduced and their application to human_metabolism is promising results in this article we exploit and generalize the k shortest efm algorithm to determine a subset of efms in a human genome_scale this subset of efms involves a wide number of reported human metabolic_pathways as well as potential novel routes and constitutes a valuable database where high_throughput data can be mapped and contextualized from a metabolic perspective to illustrate this we took expression data of healthy human tissues from a previous study and predicted their characteristic efms based on enrichment_analysis we used a multivariate hypergeometric_test and showed that it leads to more biologically_meaningful than standard hypergeometric finally a biological discussion on the characteristic efms obtained in liver is conducted finding a high_level of agreement when compared with the literature with the expansion of high_throughput molecular experimental_technologies in the past_decade particularly genomics and transcriptomics a vast amount of data is available to the scientific_community their analysis in the context of metabolic_pathways is essential to uncover their underlying functional structure and it is a widely used practice in the field of bioinformatics and systems_biology to this end different approaches have been proposed to date some of the existing_tools explain high_throughput omics_data in the light of predefined metabolic maps despite their wide_application these methods are limited as predefined maps do not capture the wide_variety of complex metabolic_states instead the use of unbiased mathematical pathway concepts based on genome_scale is suitable for this purpose among these pathway concepts path finding techniques from the field of graph_theory have been a recurrent approach in contrast to their low computational expense they face important theoretical issues because they do not consider stoichiometric mass balancing constraints as recently emphasized in for this reason other more general pathway concepts have been used to interpret omics_data particularly elementary_flux efms and recently elementary flux patterns in this article we focus on the efm approach despite its early definition the interpretation of omics_data in light of efms has been limited so_far the reason is that the number of efms explodes in a combinatorial fashion as the network size increases and classical approaches fail to compute them in large_networks that is the case for the human genome_scale which involves several thousand reactions and metabolites to face this issue computed a set of efms for each human kyoto_encyclopedia kegg map which is a reductionist approach a promising strategy is to compute a subset of efms using recently_developed optimization techniques in the present work a generalized version of the algorithm presented inis introduced and used to determine a subset of efms in the human genome_scale that captures a wide_variety of pathways in human_metabolism in particular aside from recovering an extensive number of metabolic_pathways previously_reported in the literature more to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com solutions do arise in our subset of efms which should allow us to describe more accurately the repertoire of metabolic_states in light of our subset of efms we analyzed data from in that work based on gene_expression data reactions fromare classified into highly moderately and lowly_expressed in different healthy human tissues we used this reaction classification to determine characteristic efms for each tissue based on statistical enrichment_analysis three level discrete classification of reactions prevented us from using more established enrichment techniques such as gene_set gsea instead we introduced a multivariate hypergeometric_test which considers highly_expressed and lowly_expressed reactions in the same statistical score with this test we aim to obtain as characteristic those efms enclosing an elevated number of highly_expressed reactions and as few as possible of lowly_expressed reactions this fact differs from the approach presented in which uses the standard hypergeometric_test with only one feature either highly or lowly_expressed reactions we show in different tissues that this improvement provides a more accurate picture of their characteristic efms and therefore their key metabolic_pathways the k d shortest efm algorithm is applied here to determine a subset of efms in human_metabolism aiming at capturing a diverse and representative set of pathways we integrated this subset of efms with expression data of human tissues liver brain heart kidney lung pancreas prostate spleen thymus and skeletal_muscle and determined their characteristic efms finally the technical_performance of our approach is analyzed and a biological discussion focused on liver is accomplished
