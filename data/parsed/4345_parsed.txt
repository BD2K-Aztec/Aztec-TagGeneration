sparse group factor_analysis for biclustering of multiple data_sources motivation modelling_methods that find structure in data are necessary with the current large volumes of genomic_data and there have been various efforts to find subsets of genes_exhibiting consistent_patterns over subsets of treatments these biclustering techniques have focused on one data source often gene_expression data we present a bayesian_approach for joint biclustering of multiple data_sources extending a recent method group factor_analysis to have a biclustering interpretation with additional sparsity assumptions the resulting method enables data_driven detection of linear structure present in parts of the data_sources results our simulation_studies show that the proposed method reliably infers biclusters from heterogeneous_data we tested the method on data from the nci dream drug_sensitivity prediction challenge resulting in an excellent prediction_accuracy moreover the predictions are based on several biclusters which provide insight into the data_sources in this case on gene_expression dna_methylation protein_abundance exome sequence functional_connectivity fingerprints and drug_sensitivity availability and implementationnumerous clustering_approaches have advanced to extract knowledge from sets of e g gene_expression experiments when conditions of the samples are either not known or researchers are interested in dependencies within or across experiments conditions or treatments can affect the expression levels of certain genes only and similarly many genes are likely to be co regulated under certain conditions only for this purpose biclustering techniques have been developed biclustering is traditionally defined as simultaneously clustering both rows and columns in a data matrix depending on the metric and the data different approaches have emerged aiming to cluster genes based on their expression levels being the same differing by a constant or being linearly dependent with respect to different conditions introduced a generative approach_called factor_analysis for bicluster acquisition fabia accounting for linear dependencies between gene_expression and conditions the biclusters are factors of the measurement matrix and hence can be overlapping in both genes and conditions whereas many approaches are limited to distinct clusters each bicluster can also include oppositely regulated_genes up and down_regulated across conditions similar approaches have been proposed by with the latter one additionally focusing on the inference of gene_co fabia has also been extended to better suit genotype data proposed an algorithm for simultaneous biclustering of heterogeneous multiple species data collections they investigate the identification of conserved co regulated gene groups modules by comparing genome_wide datasets for closely_related organisms and the evolution of gene_regulatory most genes are unlikely to be co regulated under every possible condition and exclusive gene_clusters cannot capture the complexity of transcriptional_regulatory their proposed approach aims to identify meaningful condition_dependent conserved modules integrating data across the same genes present in multiple species inferring bicluster structure jointly from multiple data_sources is potentially more accurate than analysis of a single set and the discovered relationships between the sources may offer new insights in this paper we extend a recent generative bayesian modelling approach group factor_analysis gfa gfa was developed for exploratory_analysis of multiple data_sources views resulting in an interpretable group sparse factorization of the data_collection when the factors are additionally variable wise sparse as a result of introducing suitable priors they are interpretable as biclusters of multiple co occurring data_sources that need not share the same features genes as opposed to as a factor model gfa further shares the favourable properties of fabia we demonstrate its use in a multi view drug_sensitivity prediction task that the previous bicluster methods could not handle naturally the approach shows superior prediction_performance and is able to infer meaningful structure present in subsets of the data
