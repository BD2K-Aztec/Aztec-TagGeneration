structural_bioinformatics bbcontacts prediction of b strand pairing from direct coupling patterns motivation it has recently become possible to build reliable de_novo models of proteins if a multiple_sequence msa of at least homologous_sequences can be built methods of global statistical network_analysis can explain the observed correlations between columns in the msa by a small set of directly coupled pairs of columns strong couplings are indicative of residue residue_contacts and from the predicted contacts a structure can be computed here we exploit the structural regularity of paired b strands that leads to characteristic_patterns in the noisy matrices of couplings the bb contacts should be detected more reliably than single contacts reducing the required number of sequences in the msas results bbcontacts predicts bb contacts by detecting these characteristic_patterns in the d map of coupling scores using two hidden_markov hmms one for parallel and one for antiparal lel contacts b bulges are modelled as indel states in contrast to existing_methods bbcontacts uses predicted instead of true secondary_structure on a standard set of test proteins of which have msas with sequences bbcontacts achieves precision for contacting bb residue pairs at recall using predicted_secondary and precision at recall using true secondary_structure while existing_tools achieve around precision at recall using true secondary_structure availability_and bbcontacts is open_source gnu affero gpl v available at https bitbucket org soedinglab bbcontacts contactmethods for protein_structure can be classified into template based and de_novo methods the first group model the structure for a query_protein based on a sequence_alignment with a homologous template protein of known structure this class of methods is by far the most widely used for its speed and reliability many protein_families lack a d template and therefore much effort has been invested into developing methods for de_novo the most successful de_novo prediction_methods such as rosetta are based on complex knowledge based scoring_functions and structural fragment assembly even though in roughly a quarter of the cases the top methods can produce models with the correct fold their practical usefulness is severely limited by the difficulty of predicting which models are correct an alternative de_novo approach relies on the observation that correlated_mutations between pairs of multiple_sequence msa columns could predict physical contacts between residues furthermore it was realized that only few correctly_predicted residue residue_contacts of the number of residues are sufficient to predict the correct protein fold v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please email journals permissions_oup however it was only recently that statistical_methods were applied to the msas that could distinguish direct couplings between msa columns from mere transitive correlations this allowed for the first time the reliable de_novo prediction of structures for proteins with many homologs in the past_few these methods have been further improved by applying different approaches of direct coupling analysis yet obtaining reliable structural_models requires large_numbers of homologous_sequences still severely limiting the scope of these methods here our goal is to increase the reliability of contact predictions by detecting patterns in the matrix of predicted couplings corresponding to interactions between secondary_structure we focus on the case of bb contacts because of their strongly constrained spatial_arrangement b sheets are composed of regularly arranged pairs of interacting b strands the interaction between two extended b strands is defined on the basis of regular patterns of hydrogen_bonds connecting residues in two different strands in either a parallel or an antiparallel fashion the prediction of contacts between b residues has applications in protein design in the study of folding characteristics and in de_novo according to a recent study while direct contact predictions have similar average precision for mainly a and mainly b proteins the structural_models obtained using these predictions as restraints are more accurate for mainly a proteins a variety of methods have been developed for the prediction of bb contacts an early method used statistical_potentials for pairs of interacting b strand residues were the first to predict bb contacts with neural_networks cheng andintroduced the important idea of exploiting the topology of b sheets in their betapro method by filtering out the solutions incompatible with the specific geometry of b sheets in mln and mln s lippi and frasconi used markov logic networks to incorporate structurebased constraints directly into the learning_process two recent methods use correlated mutation signatures to predict b sheets cmm integrates these with a b topology model bcov processes predicted coupling scores with integer_programming to enforce topological_constraints cmm bcov and mln s display the best bb contact_prediction performances so_far finally some methods aiming to predict all protein contacts not only bb contacts also use topological information in particular related to b sheet organization cmappro phycmap pconsc pconsc reports the highest contact prediction_accuracies to date it takes direct coupling scores from the pconsc meta predictor as input and trains random_forests on local windows in the coupling matrix to predict the contact state of the central cell existing bb contact prediction_methods have used known instead of predicted_secondary it is unclear however how they would perform in practice when substituting true with predicted_secondary here we describe a method to predict bb contacts that even though it makes use of predicted instead of true secondary_structure achieves better performance than previous methods we designed two hidden_markov hmms for parallel and antiparallel bb contacts that integrate signals from the predicted couplings and the predicted_secondary bbcontacts is the first predictor of bb contacts that does not require known secondary_structure from dssp and that therefore can be used in practice having to use predicted instead of true secondary_structure makes bb contact_prediction a much more challenging_problem in particular we can no longer rely on the knowledge of the exact b strand positions analyzing the contributions of different terms in bbcontacts shows that the choices that have a strong impact on psipred based_predictions do not affect dssp based results to the same extent compare for instancewith supplementary this underlines the importance of specifically designing methods to deal with predicted_secondary bbcontacts also illustrates that hmms are an attractive approach for statistical modelling of variable_length bb contacts based on the detection of specific patterns in the coupling matrices the use of a local viterbi algorithm enables the detection of local patterns in addition bbcontacts can pick up signal in a number of alignments with relatively few homologous_sequences another interesting feature is that it provides a score for each predicted b strand contact which expresses the reliability of the prediction finally bbcontacts is provided as free_and with few dependencies the runtimes on a single core of an intel_xeon e processor are typically under one minute for proteins up to residues and up to a few minutes when psm gets triggered supplementary this makes bbcontacts easily applicable to a variety of situations including predictions for large proteins and large_scale b contact_prediction another possible application for bbcontacts would be the case of inter chain b sheets provided enough homologs are available for both chains bbcontacts could be further improved by including additional information in the hmm emissions such as amino_acid profiles and solvent_accessibility predictions or other input sources complementing ccmpred for instance psicov further planned work involves incorporating input from predictors such as cmappro or phycmap which do not use direct coupling analysis and perform better than ccmpred or pconsc when few homologous_sequences are available one advantage of our approach in this respect is that it can handle new sources of input in a probabilistic manner through the addition of new terms in the emission probabilities also one could improve the use of topological_constraints by calculating posterior_probabilities for all b strand topologies that can be built from the list of best viterbi paths finally the approach developed in this study can be generalized to detect patterns of other interacting secondary_structure such as helix helix and helix strand interactions and thus points to a promising_avenue for future_research
