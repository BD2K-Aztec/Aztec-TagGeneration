genetics_and healer homomorphic computation of exact logistic_regression for secure rare_disease variants analysis in gwas motivation genome_wide gwas have been widely used in discovering the association between genotypes and phenotypes human_genome data contain valuable but highly_sensitive information unprotected disclosure of such information might put individuals privacy at risk it is important to protect human_genome data exact logistic_regression is a bias reduction method based on a penalized likelihood to discover rare_variants that are associated with disease_susceptibility we propose the healer framework to facilitate secure rare_variants analysis with a small_sample results we target at the algorithm design aiming at reducing the computational and storage costs to learn a homomorphic exact logistic regression_model i e evaluate p values of coefficients where the circuit depth is proportional to the logarithmic scale of data size we evaluate the algorithm performance using rare kawasaki_disease datasets availability_and download healer at http research ucsd dbmi org healer genome_wide gwas have largely focused on the common disease_gene which often involves large_sample in gwas many common variations e g single_nucleotide snps with frequencies have been studied to uncover the risk of complex genetic_disorders one controversy in gwas is whether multiple rare variations with frequencies much may also result in certain risk these unknown associations might be very important as they could reveal the biologic cause of diseases and provide useful suggestions for treatments for example show that rare_variants e g protein modifying rare risk_alleles play a clear role in mendelian_disorders there is increasing interest in the rare_variants studies in gwas however rare variations must have much higher effects e g odds_ratios than that of common_snps in order to be detected by ordinary gwas methods e g logistic_regression these variants may be too rare such that there are not enough participants with these rare alleles that could be identified in a study when variants are very rare i e lacking of enough samples ordinary tests e g wald_test in gwas fail to capture true significant alleles as the asymptoticapproximation assumption might be no longer valid for example in a recent study with unbalanced case control population i e the number of case patients is about times less than that of the control population the ordinary method identified hundreds of significantly rare snps that is related to breast_cancer however a later study shows that most of these significant rare snps are false_positive after applying exact logistic_regression the exact logistic_regression is more robust in computing p values for rare_variants analysis with limited sample_size the studies of rare_variants also raise significant privacy_concerns of participants rare_variants can be highly unique to the specific population which makes them more vulnerable to re identification attacks as discussed in a previous study show that an individual can be uniquely identified by using as few as independent snps recent_studies demonstrated that even anonymized genome data can leak signification personal information e g name of the participants moreover even aggregated genome information e g test_statistics can be used to recover sensitive personal information as genome data are vulnerable to various attacks it is imperative to develop protection methods to secure genome_analysis a number of technical solutions have been proposed to protect genome privacy in data analysis existing_studies can be categorized into two groups i protecting the computation process in genome data analysis and ii protecting the genome data before computation or research outcomes after computation in this work we focus on the protection of the computation process of rare_variants analysis in gwas in particular we consider the use of homomorphic encryption techniques in designing secure protocols to learn an exact logistic regression_model from encrypted data which allow researchers to securely outsource the storage and computation of sensitive data e g to commercial cloud_computing services like microsoft azure or amazon ec the development of homomorphic encryption based_methods to support secure genome data computation has been studied in where certain computation can be directly carried_out over homomorphic encrypted data the resulting encrypted outcomes when decrypted match the result of the same operations performed on the plaintext however none of the aforementioned studies has addressed the problem of rare_variants analysis in gwas in addition recently_proposed to tackle the secure rare_variants analysis using multi party computation techniques their approach assumes multiple data owners and active_participation of the owners in data storage and computation which is completely different to our model as illustrated below illustrates the application scenario of the proposed healer framework homomorphic encryption allows the encrypted rare_disease variants to be stored and computed in a cloud server without requiring the participation of data owners e g request for decryption keys by encrypting rare_variants with public key data owners can directly upload them to the cloud service thus the genetic_association of rare_disease variants with a phenotype can be securely evaluated with homomorphic computation over different cohorts the final encrypted evaluation results are accessible to researchers but it requires the private key for decryption from the trusted party remarkably there is no interaction between the trusted party and the cloud service which guarantees the confidentiality of uploaded sensitive information therefore the proposed scheme enables secure outsourcing of the computation of rare_disease variants to commercial cloud services by which individuals could contribute to the rare_disease analysis in gwas in a secure manner protected by the homomorphic encryption schemes to enable healer framework we developed novel methods including i secure rejection sampling and ii secure and efficient integer comparison to compute a homomorphic exact logistic regression_model iii parallel computation over homomorphicencrypted data to accelerate the proposed algorithm iv a compression scheme to reduce the storage cost of homomorphic encrypted data we also compared the healer framework with other competing alternatives and conducted performance analysis of the proposed protocols in this article and the supplementary including the acceptance_rate of rejection sampling circuit depth and number of homomorphic operations the rest of this article is organized as follows in section we will introduce the exact logistic regression_method and presents the implementation of homomorphic computation of exact logistic_regression section reports experimental_results and section provides the discussion of the article section concludes this article this article presented a novel healer framework for estimating the p value of exact logistic_regression parameters over homomorphic encrypted data our algorithm supports secure outsourcing and mitigates the risk of analyzing sensitive data in an untrusted cloud environment e g amazon ec or microsoft azure we proposed a new rejection sampling_approach secure integer comparison methods and parallelizable mechanisms to accelerate the execution of these algorithms which make the computation of homomorphic encrypted exact logistic_regression practical we also employed a compression scheme to reduce the storage and communication cost of homomorphic encrypted data we demonstrated the computational feasibility of our proposed_framework which takes about min to compute over records in parallel
