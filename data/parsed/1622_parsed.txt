estimating abundances of retroviral insertion_sites from dna_fragment length data motivation the relative_abundance of retroviral insertions in a host_genome is important in understanding the persistence and pathogenesis of both natural retroviral infections and retroviral gene_therapy it could be estimated from a sample of cells if only the host genomic_sites of retroviral insertions could be directly counted when host genomic_dna is randomly broken via sonication and then amplified amplicons of varying lengths are produced the number of unique lengths of amplicons of an insertion_site tends to increase according to its abundance providing a basis for estimating relative_abundance however as abundance increases amplicons of the same length arise by chance leading to a non linear relation between the number of unique lengths and relative_abundance the difficulty in calibrating this relation is compounded by sample specific variations in the relative_frequencies of clones of each length results a likelihood_function is proposed for the discrete lengths observed in each of a collection of insertion_sites and is maximized with a hybrid expectationmaximization algorithm patient data illustrate the method and simulations show that relative_abundance can be estimated with little bias but that variation in highly abundant sites can be large in replicated patient samples variation exceeds what the model impliesrequiring adjustment as in efron or using jackknife standard_errors consequently it is advantageous to collect replicate samples to strengthen inferences about relative_abundance availability an r package implements the algorithm described here it is available at http soniclength r forge r project org the new deep_sequencing methods allow longitudinal tracking of dna sequence_variation in cell_populations these methods have been applied extensively to studies of activation of host_cell genes by integration of retroviral dna in human gene_therapy vectors derived from retroviruses have been used to treat a sizeable and growing number of diseases but there have been several cases of insertional activation of cancer_genes leading to intense interest in the relationship of vector integration sites in the human_genome to the size of cell_populations harboring that clone in infections by human_t viruses the relationship between integration_site position and cell clone size is likely to be important for leukemia but the full importance remains to be clarified distributions of large_numbers of integration sites can be determined using the new deep_sequencing methods but use of this information to estimate abundance is complicated by several types of recovery biases in a typical experiment blood cells are obtained from an htlv infected subject or gene_therapy patient genomic_dna is purified from the heterogeneous populations of cells and then dna is cleaved ideally by a relatively random method such as dna shearing short dna linkers are ligated onto the dna ends then hostvirus junctions are amplified_by pcr using one primer that binds the linker and another that binds the viral_dna end pcr_products are then sequenced in bulk and the resulting reads are aligned to the human_genome here we present computational_tools for relating this type of data to the relative_abundance of each cell clone as marked by integration sites in the starting cell_population suppose that the number of cells in a patient that could harbor a viral insertion is c and the number of sites or locations in the genome of each cell determined by chromosome position and strand is l then there are c l places in which such an insertion might be found use m il to indicate whether there is an insertion in site i in cell l let m il for an insertion and m il for no insertion there the abundance of an insertion at one of the l sites is the number of cells hosting an integrated retroviral dna at that site that is is the fraction of the places harboring an insertion whose site is i the collection of relative_abundances is used to characterize a retroviral infection and monitor it for changes as examples the number of different insertion_sites the appearance of a highly abundant site an increase in the number of different sites and measures of the diversity of sites such as the shannon information or gini_coefficient all indicate features of the disease or its response to treatment previous work has tracked such measures to understand disease_progression after infection with human_t htlv latency in human_immunodeficiency hiv_infections and cell dynamics after human gene correction with integrating vectors cleaving the dna from a sample of cells using restriction_enzymes or mu transposons and sequencing the fragments hacein bey potentially allows characterization of the relative_abundance of cell_clones marked by distinct integration sites but variation in the genomic distribution of restriction_sites or sites favored by mu transposons introduces biases that can be hard to correct breaking dna by sonication is nearly random so that if those fragments could be directly counted estimates of abundance could be obtained however it is necessary to amplify the fragments by pcr before they can be sequenced and variation in the number of fragments that each parent fragment generates vastly inflates the variance of estimates or abundance section in supplementary_material based on the read countthe number of fragments whose sequence is mapped to a single site in data such asreport where most insertion_sites only contribute one or two parent fragments to the sequencer simple read_counts are useless however when multiple cells contain an insertion at the same site random shearing by sonication usually produces fragments of different lengths the number of different lengths associated with each integration_site tends to increase with its abundance but the increase is non linear due to coincidental shearing at the same site in multiple_genomes empirically fitted a calibration_curve for this non linear function using three dilutions of genomic_dna from an htlv infected individual and used it to estimate the number of parent fragments of each site in their samples below estimation of the relative_abundance of a retroviral insertion_site in an infected patient using the collection of fragment_lengths for each integration_site is considered we introduce some notation for referring to data on retroviral insertions and mention some measures that may be of interest in studying populations of sites then we describe a maximum_likelihood based on the distinct lengths of clones recovered a brief review of procedures for collecting fragment length data for retroviral insertions is given in section seefor more details we devise a statistical_approach for estimating the abundances of retroviral insertion_sites and an algorithm to implement it the algorithm is applied to real and simulated_data and the accuracy of the approach is assessed and compared with the method of supplementary_material provides extensive notes and more details including studies of estimators of number of unseen species proposed by chao and by of the shannon information and the chao shen coverage adjusted entropy and the gini_coefficient data from htlv infected patients were studied three samples taken from each patient were used and the consecutive_samples were taken at intervals ranging from days to days with a mean of days the patients are labeled a b k in the figures and the individual samples in each patient are numbered in chronological_order on each of those days three replicate subsamples were taken from the dna pool of each sample the algorithm of section gave estimates of and the glm fit used cubic b splines for the fragment_lengths with interior knots at and the boundary knots are placed at and at plus the largest observed length and counts of zero were used for unobserved lengths in that range most results below are based on simultaneously fitting all three replicates of a single sample however in some instances fits are based on the separate replicates three iterations of the algorithm were required and then the fit was deemed to have converged when the absolute value of gradients of the log_likelihood with respect to i were all when divided byby by i and in any case most samples had converged in the minimum three iterations but one sample required iterations to converge setting more stringent convergence criteria had negligible effect on the results shows the graphs ofof of for triplicate subsamples of a single sample from each of the two different patients samples b and i as can be seen there is a substantial_difference between the two patients and the curves for patient i vary markedly among the triplicates as a consequence it seems unwise to try to find a common estimat to be applied across all the samples or even the subsamples the insert inshows the expected number of unique lengths j j exp j corresponding to eacheach each curve as a function of the number of parent fragments estimates based on these curves approximate the maximum_likelihood they can be compared with the empirical calibration_curve of which is seen to be quite different from these indeed they are so different from one another that no one of them could adequately substitute for the others it is of some interest to see how the curves forfor for vary by patient by sample and by replicate supplementaryshows the histogram ofof of the ratio of heights of the curve at length and note that this portion of the curve reflects the typically geometric decline in the probability of shearing the values vary by fold the analysis_of anova for log with factors for patient and sample date nested within patient shows significant effects for patient p and for date p the variance components are estimated as for patient for date and for replicate the variance_component for patient is smallest and an order_of than the sum of the other two so most of the variation would seem to be tied to the sample_preparation and processing the diagnostic plots of section shown in section of the supplementary_material revealed a few sites whose curve for had sections where was much smaller than the estimate or perhaps even zero one such site at chr f by hg had no lengths between and but many outside that region a repeat of atga covers to or lengths which complicates mapping the shear site the shortfall in might be addressed by inspection of the original sequence_reads for this site or by imputing the number apparently missed such corrective measures would be warranted if high_abundance sites were affected each abundance parameter is assigned to an interval category in each category the average of the parameters is found of the estimates based on three replicates of the estimates based on single replicates and of the average based on empirical calibration we addressed the problem of estimating the abundance of insertion_sites from data on fragment_lengths by a maximum_likelihood approach simulations showed that the method works well when the estimated probabilities of fragment_lengths are not too variable when a glm is used to fit the fragment length_distribution the abundance estimates have little bias and the asymptotic standard_errors accurately portray the variability in simulated_data these standard_errors are available for single replicates and provide a check on the model empirical variations in triplicates from patient data varied more than expected showing overdispersion of abundance estimates further the z statistics for the change in relative_abundance have a broader distribution than the theory suggests these observations emphasize the value of replication and mandate the use of standard_errors derived empirically from replicates as with a jackknife standard_error or by application of the large_scale hypothesis_testing approach inspection of the data as histograms and as normal probability plots suggests that the large_scale hypothesis_testing framework is suitable for testing changes in relative_abundance the standard_errors associated with relative_abundances increase_dramatically as the relative_abundances increase using the current setup this makes it rather difficult to detect changes in the relative_abundance of insertion_sites that are highly abundant for example a change from to is below the limit of detection in data like those shown here in which there are three replicates the standard_errors of abundant sites would diminish if a sample were divided_into more replicates jackknife corrections for bias in the total number of insertion_sites the entropy of abundances and their gini_coefficient due to unseen insertion_sites were successful in simulations sections and in supplementary_material in spite of a large fraction of unseen sites these corrections were enabled by the replicates which also allowed the computation of jackknife standard_errors some heterogeneity of fragment_lengths across sites was observed the increase in power of added replicates to detect this also emphasizes the importance of replication even more replicates than the three used here may be needed for careful_monitoring of patient status the power to detect change in the abundance of highly abundant insertion_sites is limited even with three replicates of each sample in clinical monitoring in which highly abundant sites play_a an obvious way to increase power is to increase the number of replicates beyond the three replicates used here going forward these methods allow much more detailed_assessment of clonal behavior during htlv infection in the first analysis of these data abundances could only be estimated roughly and standard_errors had to be empirically determined using the methods described here combined with ongoing data_acquisition it will be possible to relate much more fine_grained information on clonal abundance to clinically relevant_parameters such as viral gene_expression and leukemogenesis
