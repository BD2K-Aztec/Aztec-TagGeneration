data_and copicat a software system for predicting interactions between proteins and chemical_compounds since tens of millions of chemical_compounds have been accumulated in public chemical databases fast comprehensive computational_methods to predict interactions between chemical_compounds and proteins are needed for virtual_screening of lead_compounds previously we proposed a novel method for predicting proteinchemical interactions using two layer support_vector classifiers that require only readily available biochemical data i e amino_acid of proteins and structure formulas of chemical_compounds in this article the method has been implemented as the copicat web_service with an easy to use front end interface users can simply submit a proteinchemical interaction prediction job using a pre trained classifier or can even train their own classification model by uploading training data copicats fast and accurate computational_prediction has enhanced lead compound discovery against a database of tens of millions of chemical_compounds implying that the search_space for drug_discovery is extended by times compared with currently well used high_throughput methodologies availability the copicat server is available at http copicat dna bio keio ac jp all functions including the prediction function are freely_available via anonymous login without registration registered users however can use the system more intensively contact due to the limitations in experimental methods for determining interactions between proteins and chemical_compounds a comprehensive computational_approach is useful in the early_stages of the drug_discovery although d structure based_methods such as docking analysis have been studied intensively in this field they are still time consuming and not really feasible for genome wide_application to address the problem we developed a comprehensively applicable statistical prediction method for interactions between any protein and chemical compound that requires only proteinprediction job user chooses prediction from the side menu and submits the users input_data consisting of pairs of proteins and chemical_compounds the prediction result is returned as a list of proteinchemical pairs with classification labels interact or non interact and their probabilities each protein and chemical compound is linked to a uniprot or pubchem database entry prediction against databases the copicat web_service performs a prediction job against a database by receiving the users chemical compound or protein data as a query and returning the prediction results against all molecules in one of the system side databases the following databases are available for use in the predictions ensembl entries refseq entries drugbank approved drug_targets entries drugbank approved structure entries and pubchem entries prediction against pubchem is realized as a specialized function chemical blast training job when a user uploads his own training data an svm trained with the user data is added to the pre defined first layer svms and then the second layer svm is re trained using the augmented first layer outputs sample data the default positive samples were obtained from drugbank in addition users can upload their own positive samples first layer model addition users can choose to add pre trained models to the first layer in three ways i the users own previously_trained model ii the system side specialized models nuclear_receptor ion_channel gpcr and enzyme iii other user trained models via the model circulation function
