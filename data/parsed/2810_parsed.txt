gene_expression mass_spectrometry based spatial proteomics_data analysis using proloc and prolocdata motivation experimental spatial proteomics i e the high_throughput assignment of proteins to sub cellular_compartments based on quantitative proteomics_data promises to shed new light on many biological_processes given adequate computational_tools results here we present proloc a complete infrastructure to support and guide the sound analysis of quantitative mass_spectrometry based spatial proteomics_data it provides functionality for unsupervised and supervised machine_learning for data exploration and protein classification and novelty detection to identify new puta tive sub cellular clusters the software builds upon existing infrastructure for data management and data_processing availability proloc is implemented in the r language and available under an open_source from the bioconductor_project http www bioconductor org a vignette with a complete tutorial describingknowledge of the spatial distribution of proteins is of critical importance to elucidate their role and refine our understanding of cellular_processes mis localization of proteins have been associated with cellular_dysfunction and disease_states highlighting the importance of localization studies spatial or organelle proteomics is the systematic study of the proteins and their subcellular_localization these compartments can be organelles i e structures defined by lipid bi layers macro molecular_assemblies of proteins and nucleic_acids or large_protein despite technological_advances in spatial proteomics experimental_designs and progress in mass_spectrometry software support is lacking to address this we developed the proloc package that provides a wide_range of thoroughly documented analysis methodologies the software includes stateof the art statistical machine_learning and bundles them in a consistent framework accommodating any experimental_designs and quantitation strategies
