towards d structure_prediction of large rna_molecules an integer_programming framework to insert local d motifs in rna_secondary motivation the prediction of rna d structures from its sequence only is a milestone to rna function analysis and prediction in recent_years many methods addressed this challenge ranging from cycle decomposition and fragment assembly to molecular_dynamics simulations however their predictions remain fragile and limited to small_rnas to expand the range and accuracy of these techniques we need to develop algorithms that will enable to use all the structural_information available in particular the energetic contribution of secondary_structure interactions is now well documented but the quantification of non canonical interactionsthose shaping the tertiary structureis poorly_understood nonetheless even if a complete rna tertiary_structure energy_model is currently unavailable we now have catalogues of local d structural_motifs including non canonical base_pairings a practical objective is thus to develop techniques enabling us to use this knowledge for robust rna tertiary_structure predictors results in this work we introduce rna moip a program that benefits from the progresses made over the last years in the field of rna_secondary and expands these methods to incorporate the novel local motif information available in databases using an integer_programming framework our method refines predicted secondary_structures i e removes incorrect canonical base_pairs to accommodate the insertion of rna d motifs i e hairpins internal loops and k way junctions then we use predictions as templates to generate complete d structures with the mc sym program we benchmarked rna moip on a set of rnas with sizes varying from to nucleotides we show that our approach i improves the accuracy of canonical base_pair predictions ii identifies the best secondary_structures in a pool of suboptimal structures and iii predicts accurate d structures of large rna_molecules availability rna moip is publicly_available at http csb cs mcgill ca rnamoip ribonucleic_acids perform a broad range of functions in cells ribozymes such as the rnase p or the group_ii catalyze chemical_reactions whereas micrornas hybridize to messenger_rna to regulate_gene to achieve these functions many rnas fold into specific d structures that are directly to whom correspondence should be addressed encoded in their nucleotide_sequence the structural_information is therefore useful to predict the function nonetheless experimental determination of rna_structures remains time consuming and technically_challenging it follows that we need to develop fast and reliable computational_tools to help to predict them during the last few years several groups have developed fully_automated rna d structure_prediction programs to date the most popular ones are farna the mc pipeline ifoldrna and nast a recent review by laing and schlick proposes a comprehensive_overview of these strategies conditional_random techniques implemented in barnacle and treefolder also appear as a promising approach however unlike classical secondary_structure predictors such as rnastructure rnafold unafold contrafold or contextfold the range of application of the rna d structure predictors is limited currently their time requirement and or their accuracy restrict their application range to sequences with nucleotides by contrast secondary_structure predictors are fast and reliable on sequences with nucleotides mc fold and rnawolf zu expanded these techniques to predict extended secondary_structures i e including non canonical interactions but these algorithms remain_limited to predict nested secondary_structures without k way junctions thus precisely lacking the structural_motifs shaping the rna d structure thus ab_initio d structure_prediction of large rna_molecules i e nucleotides in our context is still an open question to overcome this barrier new models are required indeed due to the paucity of structural data available the design of a complete model accounting for all the subtle d structural_variations observed in experimentally_determined structures is unlikely the methods developed in this article are based on a recent idea suggesting that rna d structures share_common structural subunits the decomposition of rna_structures in elementary blocks was first introduced bywho proposed a description of rna_secondary including non canonical interactions based on cycles more recently the analysis of experimental d structures revealed that similar d motifs can be found in multiple unrelated structures here we define a motif as a group of nucleotides that adopt a specific d shape and interaction pattern including non canonical interactions several groups have developed computational_methods to extract and classify rna d motifs the most popular databases are fr d rnamotif and rnajunction importantly these databases identify d motifs involving three or more segments of the same molecule defined as k way junctions when the motif is the branching point of several helical segments such motifs are important because they are precisely those shaping the d structure of an rna_molecule despite the knowledge accumulated in these databases the integration of this information into current models remains complicated first the classification of rna motifs can be ambiguous i e a motif and its submotifs can match different database entries next the structural compatibility between two or more motifs can be difficult to resolve i e how to concatenate two motifs it is worth noting that a method to predict the topological family of a given way junction has been recently_introduced by interestingly to complement the secondary_structure programs implemented semiautomated methods resp rna d d and assemble for building d models from known predicted_secondary information these programs provide intuitive interfaces enabling their users to insert d motifs and modify backbone angles of a coarse_grained input structure from this standpoint the hierarchical approaches i e rna d d and assemble appear well suited to the prediction of large rna_structures their advantage resides in their capacity to benefit from the high_accuracy of classical secondary_structure predictors i e thermodynamic or comparative models to build a scaffold of the structure and then to leave to the user the task of decorating the model with the various structural_motifs found in databases although this strategy is flexible it is time consuming and requires human participation recently cruz and westhof developed rmdetect a method to predict g bulge loops kinkturns c loops and tandem ga loops in rna_secondary but the prediction of more complex motifs such as the k way junctions and the construction of d rna_structures remain_open problems in this article we introduce rna moip an integer_programming ip framework for inserting rna d motifs inside known or predicted rna_secondary we use our predictions as a template to generate putative rna d structures using the mc sym software and show that we are able to predict accurate d structures of large rna_sequences integer_programming techniques have gained a lot of interest recently as they provided state of the art methods for predicting rna_secondary with pseudoknots one of their strengths resides in their flexibility and capacity to incorporate heterogeneous constraints a valuable advantage when it comes to incorporate k way junctions the article is organized as follows in section we formally define the motifs describe our motif database and introduce our ip model rna moip in section we apply rna moip on a set of nine rna used by laing and schlick to benchmark rna d structure_prediction programs our results show that rna moip i improves the accuracy of canonical base_pair predictions ii identifies the best secondary_structures in a pool of suboptimal structures generated by rnasubopt and iii predicts accurate d structures for sequences with sizes varying between and nucleotidesan insight that cannot be reached by other programs finally in section we discuss our results and propose future_research
