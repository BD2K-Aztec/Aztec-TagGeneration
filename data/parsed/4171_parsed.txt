gene_expression seganndb interactive web_based genomic segmentation motivation dna_copy profiles characterize regions of chromosome gains losses and breakpoints in tumor_genomes although many models have been proposed to detect these alterations it is not clear which model is appropriate before visual_inspection the signal noise and models for a particular profile results we propose seganndb a web_based computer vision system for genomic segmentation first visually inspect the profiles and manually annotate altered regions then seganndb determines the precise alteration locations using a mathematical_model of the data and annotations seganndb facilitates collaboration between biologists and bioinformaticians and uses the university of california santa_cruz genome_browser to visualize copy_number alongside known genes availability_and the breakpoints project on inria gforge hosts the source_code an amazon machine image can be launched and a demonstration web_site is http bioviz rocq inria fr dna_copy cnas are amplifications gains_and of chromosomal_regions that can result from different cellular_mechanisms and are important in the study of many types of cancer genome_wide assays such as array_comparative acgh and single_nucleotide microarrays can be used to detect cnas after spatial and sample normalization these assays yield noisy measurements of approximate copy_number with a resolution of up to kb between probes the goal in analyzing these data is to accurately extract a list of altered regions from each noisy sample in this article we define accuracy in terms of annotated regions given by an expert we treat this expert as a gold_standard and so the goal of our model is to be consistent with his or her annotations observed large annotation error_rates for several segmentation_algorithms applied to a large database of neuroblastoma tumors in this article we propose to eliminate these errors with seganndb a computer vision system whose model always agrees with the provided annotations previous work in dna_copy analysis can be roughly divided_into two categories of methods visualization and mathematical_models this article combines these two lines of research by proposing a mathematical_model that can be iteratively improved by adding visual annotations to zoomed scatterplots of the data first we will review previous methods in both categories many software_packages have been developed for visualization of acgh data for example visualization and analysis of molecular_profiles vamp can be used for exploratory_analysis or to visualize predicted alterations from a model another visual_analysis program is charmview which allows manual identification of regions for significance testing a potential problem with these programs is that the displayed model is calculated before visualization and cannot be interactively updated several web_sites for array_cgh analysis have been proposed cghweb allows visual comparison of several algorithms applied to the same normalized profile arraycyght and capweb provide normalization and copy_number calling isacgh supports analysis segmentation visualization and export to the ensembl genome_browser arrayfusion exports data and segmentations in formats suitable for genome_browsers like the method we propose in this article these web_sites facilitate collaboration with biologists unlike these web_sites our seganndb software allows the user to interactively update the displayed segmentation model in contrast to visual methods for alteration detection mathematical_models can be used to automatically predict lists of alterations based on certain mathematical assumptions about the data the available mathematical_models specifically_designed for detecting cnas are summarized by however a major_problem with this class of methods is to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work model_selection given a particular dataset to analyze it is obvious to choose neither a particular model nor its tuning parameters how to evaluate which model is best without doing more experiments the only method of evaluation is to plot the model alongside scatterplots of the data a good model should capture all visible alterations in the data and should not predict any false_positive detections this visual criterion for model evaluation can be used by creating a database of annotated regions that encode an experts interpretation of the data in that study default parameter_values of several models were shown to yield many false_positive detections and even after tuning the parameters of each model there were no models with perfect detection_accuracy in this article we propose to solve this problem by interactively annotating alterations in scatterplots of the data then our software selects a tuning parameter that agrees with the user_defined annotations and immediately shows the updated model if the displayed segmentation model does not capture the alterations that are obvious from visual_inspection then annotations can be added to correct the model a user specific model can thus be iteratively improved until it agrees with the annotators visual interpretation of the data in addition the annotations can be assembled into a database so we can apply algorithms that automatically recognize previously annotated patterns we note that this computer vision approach has also been successful for recognizing phenotypes in cell microscopy after annotating a small subset of the data the system adapts to the annotations and provides consistent predictions for unannotated data this article_describes seganndb a web_based free opensource implementation of this interactive genomic segmentation model the name is short for segmentation and annotation database as annotations are stored in a database which is used by machine_learning to find an appropriate segmentation after interactive annotation the learned segmentation model can be directly exported to the university of california santa_cruz ucsc_genome for viewing detected alterations alongside known genes finally seganndb promotes collaboration between biologists doctors and bioinformaticians doing genome_wide copy_number analysis collaboration using seganndb is simple once a bioinformatician uploads a profile anyone with a web_browser can create a user specific segmentation model by drawing annotated regions on the scatterplots this makes it easy for people with expert prior_knowledge but no programming experience to browse the profiles and annotate regions of interest e g a biologist looking for alterations in known oncogenes after annotation the bioinformatician can download the annotations and segmentation model for further analyses such as detection of common alterations in several related samples or survival regression_based on the detected alterations
