systems_biology tfrank network based prioritization of regulatory associations underlying transcriptional_responses motivation uncovering mechanisms_underlying gene_expression control is crucial to understand complex cellular_responses studies in gene_regulation often aim to identify regulatory players involved in a biological_process of interest either transcription_factors coregulating a set of target_genes or genes eventually controlled by a set of regulators these are frequently prioritized with respect to a context specific relevance score current approaches rely on relevance measures accounting exclusively for direct transcription factortarget interactions namely overrepresentation of binding_sites or target ratios gene_regulation has however intricate behavior with overlapping indirect effect that should not be neglected in addition the rapid accumulation of regulatory data already enables the prediction of large_scale networks suitable for higher_level exploration by methods based on graph_theory a paradigm_shift is thus emerging where isolated and constrained analyses will likely be replaced by whole network systemic aware strategies results we present tfrank a graph_based framework to prioritize regulatory players involved in transcriptional_responses within the regulatory_network of an organism whereby every regulatory path containing genes of interest is explored and incorporated into the analysis tfrank selected important regulators of yeast adaptation to stress_induced by quinine and acetic_acid which were missed by a direct effect approach notably they reportedly confer resistance toward the chemicals in a preliminary study in human tfrank unveiled regulators involved in breast tumor_growth when applied to genes whose expression signatures correlated with short_interval to metastasis availability prototype at http kdbio inesc id pt software tfrank transcription is the first step in the flow of biological_information from genome to proteome and its tight regulation serves as a crucial to whom correspondence should be addressed checkpoint in most biological_processes transcriptional_control often results from the concerted_action of diverse transcription_factors tfs acting alone or as interacting_partners regulating or being targeted and participating in complex feedback_loops genome_wide studies have been unveiling intricate regulatory_networks with increasing layers of complexity as the hierarchy is amplified empowered by the rapid accumulation of regulatory data in public_repositories namely yeastract contains tftarget links for saccharomyces_cerevisiae while jaspar and transfac collect binding_sites and position_specific for diverse eukaryotes including human these data provide information on the topology of the regulatory_network which is static and thus not sufficient per se to determine_whether a given association is relevant or not in a specific biological_context in fact binding of a given tf to the promoter_region of its target s is rather an intermittent event triggered by biochemical stimuli and ultimately leading to changes in expression insight on the mechanisms_underlying the stimulusresponse effect can only be achieved through an integrated study of control and behavior where three challenges often arise i identification of regulators of genes involved in a similar related biological_process ii identification of genes coregulated by a group of tfs of interest and iii prioritization of regulators target_genes or regulatory_interactions with respect to a measure of relevance expressing their contribution within the regulatory_network under study diverse strategies have been proposed to address the first challenge a popular one is to rank tfs based on the ratio of genes targeted in the dataset under analysis this score can be normalized by the relative number of targets in the genome to avoid excessive bias toward tfs controlling very large regulons alternatively methods may rely on a statistical_framework to discover enriched target binding_sites by calculating their overrepresentation in the test sequences against a background model estimated from a collection of randomly_selected sequences eventually considering cross species_conservation a drawback of such procedure is that results are highly susceptible to the choice of the background model and variations on the statistical parameters other strategies have overcome_this by computing the genome_wide overrepresentation of binding_sites page improved through comparative_analysis with orthologous sequences based on phylogenetic_footprinting regulatory associations have also been uncovered from expression data alone by searching for correlation of expression_profiles under the assumption that tfs tend to express coherently with their targets however this is often not the case in addition these techniques tend to ignore physical binding and thus generate a larger number_of the issue was recently mitigated by incorporating binding expression data and three types of control regulation activation and inhibition most methods for the second challenge are experimental relying on chip_chip and dna_microarray assays to find putative targets computationally the problem has been addressed by computing the genome_wide enrichment of binding_sites or the correlation between the expression of each gene with the composite expression of sets of genes pertaining identical binding_sites all revised approaches include some form of prioritization based on a relevance score and most are able to test largescale data nonetheless they restrict to direct neighbors in the network disregarding overlapping control and systemic effects of utter importance in gene_regulation where cascade responses proliferate this systemic perspective was supported in recent work by suggesting that evolution might lead to the introduction of new layers of control between tfs and their targets embedding this knowledge into the relevance score would likely increase informativeness and accuracy in determining key regulatory players particularly when coupled with the ability to direct the search toward wider purposed or more specific regulators another characteristic of the methods reviewed herein is that they are mostly sequence driven and thus not tailored for the study of higher_level hypothesis on gene_regulation notably their ability to predict tftarget affinities can be exploited in a first step to derive regulations and build large_scale regulatory_networks for methods based on graph_theory known to deliver effective and efficient network_analysis notably network motif mining has been successfully_applied to the identification of regulatory_modules this technique aims to partition the network in coherent groups and is thus more appropriate for finding subgroups of activity rather than studying the composite effect generating a particular response in this article we present tfrank a method to prioritize regulatory players involved in a process of interest considering all known regulatory paths of a given organism the most common use case is to rank the tfs controlling a set of genes responsive under specific conditions according to a score calculated as follows each gene in the network is given an initial_weight indicative of its presence_or in from the gene_set expression values or any alternative measure of importance may be used a personalized ranking strategy is then applied to propagate the weights through the network graph in the targettf direction for the prioritization of targets of a set of regulators the diffusion is performed in the tftarget direction instead tfrank is independent from network construction and may be applied to any organism with available tftarget interactions tfrank provides i full topology analysis including alternative regulatory paths with intermediate layers of control ii ability to regulate preference for more global or local players iii integrated stimulusresponse analysis of static binding and dynamic_response iv potential incorporation of interaction confidence_scores and v normalization to mitigate bias toward tfs with a large number of targets or genes acted upon by a large number of regulators we evaluate the contribution of each tfrank parameter to the ranking on real_data we test the effectiveness of tfrank to unravel regulators potentially involved in the transcriptional_control of biological_processes in yeast and human for yeast we examine the tfs output by tfrank for two sets of genes upregulated in response to stress_induced by the antimalarial_drug quinine and the food preservative acetic_acid for human we present a preliminary study of the tfrank suggested regulators of genes whose expression signature has been previously associated with short_interval to metastasis in breast_cancer we presented tfrank a graph_based framework to identify relevant regulators mediating specific transcriptional_responses through whole network_analysis of gene activity tfrank successfully highlighted regulators potentially involved in the yeast response to quinine and acetic_acid induced stresses in a preliminary study in human tfrank revealed tfs presumably controlling genes related to metastasis in breast_cancer we observed that by assuming a systemic rather than isolated tf action perspective tfrank captured valuable information about the regulatory_mechanisms that would not have been unveiled otherwise we showed that this strategy provides adequate parameters to effectively control the level of regulatory specificity for the problem under study fine_tune tftarget association scores and incorporate expression levels or alternative measures of relevance into the input gene_list tfrank relies on an additive_model to compute the relevance score which requires_additional care when mixing positive_and input values a potential workaround is to analyze genes in two distinct groups or to use absolute_values the presented case studies supported tfrank as a promising tool to unveil important tfs despite the real set of regulations active in the process under study remained undisclosed all known tftarget interactions were used
