causal network_inference using biochemical kinetics motivation networks are widely used as structural summaries of biochemical_systems statistical estimation of networks is usually based on linear or discrete models however the dynamics of biochemical_systems are generally non linear suggesting that suitable non linear formulations may offer gains with respect to causal network_inference and aid in associated prediction_problems results we present a general framework for network_inference and dynamical prediction using time course data that is rooted in non linear biochemical kinetics this is achieved by considering a dynam ical system based on a chemical_reaction graph with associated kinetic_parameters both the graph and kinetic_parameters are treated as unknown inference is carried_out within a bayesian_framework this allows prediction of dynamical_behavior even when the underlying reaction graph itself is unknown or uncertain results based on i data simulated from a mechanistic_model of mitogen_activated signaling and ii phosphoproteomic data from cancer_cell demonstrate that non linear formulations can yield gains in causal network_inference and permit dynamical prediction and uncertainty quantification in the challenging setting where the reaction graph is unknown availability_and matlab r a software is available to download fromstatistical network_inference techniques are widely used in the analysis of multivariate biochemical data these techniques aim to make inferences regarding a network n whose vertices are identified with biomolecular components e g genes or proteins and edges with direct_or regulatory interplay between those components network_inference are typically rooted in linear or discrete models whose statistical and computational advantages facilitate exploration of large spaces of networks e g on the other hand when the network_topology is known non linear ordinary_differential odes are widely used to model biochemical dynamics the intermediate case where ode_models are used to select between candidate networks has received less attention we propose a general framework called chemical model averaging chema that uses biochemical ode_models to carry out both network_inference and dynamical prediction in summary we consider a dynamical system dx dt f g x where the state vector x contains the abundances of molecular_species g is a chemical_reaction graph that characterizes reactions in the system f g is a kinetic_model that depends on g and collects together all unknown kinetic_parameters a causal network n is obtained as a coarse summary n g of the reaction graph g in which each chemical_species appears as a single_node and directed edges indicate that the parent is involved in chemical_reaction s which have the child as product we make these notions precise below given time course data d consisting of noisy measurements of x we carry out inference and prediction within a bayesian_framework in particular we treat g itself as unknown and make inference concerning it using the posterior_distribution where the marginal likelihood pdjg captures how well the chemical_reaction graph g describes data d taking_into both parameter_uncertainty and model_complexity and pjg is a prior density over the kinetic_parameters in contrast to linear or discrete models that are motivated by tractability our likelihood pdj g depends on richer reaction graphs g and their associated kinetics this article makes three contributions i a general framework for joint network learning and dynamical prediction using ode_models ii a specific implementation chema rooted in michaelismenten kinetics that uses metropolis within gibbs_sampling to allow bayesian_inference at feasible computational_cost and iii an empirical investigation using both simulated and experimental time course data of the performance of chema relative to several existing_approaches for network_inference and dynamical prediction the statistical connection between linear odes and network_inference using linear_models has been discussed in oates and mukherjee and exploited in several approaches based on non linear odes have been proposed including aij o and l ahdesm aki this article extends these ideas by formulating a bayesian_approach to both network_inference and dynamical prediction that is rooted in chemical kinetics bayesian model_selection based on nonlinear odes has been shown to be a promising strategy for to whom correspondence should be addressed the author

generated rather than hand crafted biochemical_models thereby allowing full network_inference without manual specification of candidate models performed bayesian model_selection by comparing steady_state data with equilibrium solutions of automatically generated ode_models this article extends this approach to time course data and prediction of dynamics there are several considerations that motivate chema i inference in biological_systems is complicated by correlations between components that are co regulated but not causally_linked it is well known that under a linear formulation the causal network n is in general unidentifiable for example it may not be possible to orient certain edges or edges may be inferred between co regulated nodes due to strong associations between them non linear kinetic equations in contrast are able to confer asymmetries between nodes and may be sufficient to enable orientation of edges although we note that causal_inference using non linear_models still requires a number of strong assumptions as a consequence chema can in principle aid in causal network_inference and empirical results below support this ii in contrast to linear_models in chema the mechanistic roles of individual variables are respected this facilitates analysis of data obtained under specific molecular interventions and enhances scientific interpretability iii prediction of dynamical_behavior e g response to a stimulus or to a drug treatment in general depends on the chemical_reaction graph in settings where the graph itself is unknown or uncertain e g due to genetic or epigenetic context chema allows prediction of dynamics by averaging over an ensemble of automatically generated candidate reaction graphs the chema framework is general and can in principle be used in many settings where kinetic formulations are available to describe the dynamics including gene_regulation metabolism and protein signaling for definiteness in this article we focus on protein signaling_networks mediated by phosphorylation and provide a specific implementation of the general framework phosphorylation kinetics have been widely_studied and ode formulations are available including those based on michaelismenten kinetics the remainder of the article is organized as follows first we introduce the model and associated statistical formulation second we discuss network_inference and dynamical prediction within this framework third we show empirical results on simulated and experimental_data comparing chema with several existing_approaches finally we discuss our findings and suggest several directions for further work we proposed a general framework for using chemical kinetics in network_inference and dynamical prediction the use of chemical kinetics can be expected to contribute gains in causal_inference because the underlying models are not structurally symmetric allowing causal directionality to be established in empirical results we found that while chema struggled to identify kinetic_parameters from data it was nevertheless able to identify the causal network this discrepancy is explained by the fact that the latter is in a sense a projection of the former and can be identifiable even when the full set of parameters are not an important challenge in systems_biology is to predict the effect on signaling of a novel intervention such as a drug treatment at present dynamical predictions in systems_biology require a known chemical_reaction graph for instance taken from the literature a system of odes is usually specified based on such a graph and used for prediction however in many settings the chemical_reaction graph may differ depending on cell_type or disease_state and cannot be assumed known in contrast chema shows how prediction of dynamical_behavior may be possible even when the reaction graph itself is unknown a priori unlike more convenient linear or discrete formulations our use of chemical kinetic_models provides interpretable predictions for example the dynamic_behavior of phosphoprotein concentrations obtained under chemical kinetic_rate laws is physically plausible i e smooth bounded and non negative furthermore by averaging predictions over reaction graphs our approach should provide robustness in typical situations where it is unreasonable to expect to identify g precisely nevertheless prediction of trajectories based on the protein data was challenging likely because of noise and small_sample supplementary we anticipate that continuing technical_advances will move high_throughput closer to the favorable simulation regimes in section on which we found the richer nonlinear models to be useful several improvements can be made to the chema implementation reported here of which we highlight two i gradient matching rather than numerical solution of the automatically generated dynamical_systems can help to relieve the computational_demands associated with exploration the large model spaces but the euler approximations we used for this purpose are crude improved gradient matching should be possible at the expense of requiring more time points via higher_order expansions or at the expense of additional modeling assumptions kernel regression the penalized likelihood approaches ofchema include inference of model_parameters and computation of marginal likelihoods for model_selection the second is an active area of research with candidate approaches including variational approximations and mcmc in general the computational_burden of chema will be higher than many methods see_supplementary by way of illustration bayesian_inference and prediction for a system of protein species required over h serial computational time in contrast linear or discrete models offer better scalability to high_dimensional settings thus chema can complement existing methodologies but is not at present applicable to truly high_dimensional problems with hundreds_or of nodes finally we note the following caveats i the automatic generation of kinetic equations limits the extent to which detailed knowledge about particular biochemical_processes and dynamics may be incorporated ii our empirical results suggest that more complex interactions including kinase inhibition can be extremely_difficult to identify in practice iii the form of kinetics used here will likely be suboptimal when the assumptions of the michaelismenten approximation are violated iv larger training and test datasets may be needed to allow truly effective trajectory prediction and comprehensive assessment of performance
