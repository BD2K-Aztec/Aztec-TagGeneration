data_and orthogonal matrix_factorization enables integrative_analysis of multiple rna_binding downloaded from motivation rna_binding rbps play_important in post transcriptional_control of gene_expression including splicing transport polyadenylation and rna_stability to model proteinrna interactions by considering all available sources of information it is necessary to integrate the rapidly_growing rbp experimental_data with the latest genome_annotation gene function rna_sequence and structure such integration is possible by matrix_factorization where current approaches have an undesired tendency to identify only a small number of the strongest patterns with overlapping features because proteinrna interactions are orchestrated by multiple factors methods that identify discriminative patterns of varying strengths are needed results we have developed an integrative orthogonality regularized nonnegative matrix factoriza tion ionmf to integrate_multiple data_sources and discover non overlapping class specific rna binding_patterns of varying strengths the orthogonality constraint halves the effective size of the factor model and outperforms other nmf models in predicting rbp interaction sites on rna we have integrated the largest data compendium to date which includes clip experiments on rbps involved in splicing such as hnrnps u af elavl tdp and fus and processing of utr ago igf bp we show that the integration of multiple data_sources improves the pre dictive accuracy of retrieval of rna binding_sites in our study the key predictive_factors of protein_rna were the position of rna_structure and sequence_motifs rbp co binding and gene region type we report on a number of protein specific patterns many of which are consistent with experimentally_determined properties of rbps availability_and the ionmf implementation and example datasets are available at https github com mstrazar ionmf rna_binding rbps play_a in the control of gene_expression misregulation of rbps is associated with diseases such as fragile_x neurologic_disorders and cancer our understanding of proteinrna interaction has been greatly_improved by the use of genomic methods such as individual nucleotide_resolution uv crosslinking and immunoprecipitation iclip which identifies rbp crosslinking sites on a genome_wide scale past iclip studies have shown that rbps bind and regulate a large number of transcripts computational_analysis and prediction of these interactions is therefore critical to gain a comprehensive understanding of rbp functions current approaches to model proteinrna interactions focus on individual data_sources and require precise structural knowledge of the involved proteins they rarely exploit other available omics_data general approaches such as bayesian_networks hidden_markov or svms have been applied to model proteinrna interactions using multiple data_sources however their application was limited to individual rbps and the importance of only a limited number of features governing proteinrna interaction were highlighted such as single degenerate motifs the lack of presented features is partly due to the difficulties associated with interpretation of inferred models we have developed a modeling_technique based on multiple matrix_factorization that is capable of integrating data_sources for multiple rbps the generated models are both accurate and interpretable new biological_knowledge can be gained by exploring the identified combinatorial_effects among various features of data_sources that define patterns of proteinrna binding_sites on rna nonnegative_matrix nmf methods have been extensively applied in machine_learning for clustering community detection classification etc the classic nmf algorithm finds an approximation of a data matrix that is described as a product of two or more matrices with lower ranks a factor model an advantage of nmf is the interpretable parts based representation of patterns present in the data this is due to the latent_factors being constrained to non negative_values which can then be combined in an additive way to approximate the original data integrative nmf approaches provide biologically_meaningful in various bioinformatics applications for example nmf was used to integrate_multiple matrices with a common dimension and to discover mirna and gene regulatory_modules or to discover modules of genes mirna_targets and dna_methylation markers in cancer patients various improvements of the nmf algorithm have been suggested to obtain more comprehensive models the sparsity of factor_models improves the interpretability and modularity of projections sparsity is achieved by including l norm constraints on the model coefficients alternatively the l l norm ratio of the resulting projection can be explicitly tuned which produces sparser solutions but does not guarantee modularity other methods constrain the basis vectors to convex sets the mentioned methods however do not focus on modular decompositions where samples and features do not overlap within clusters this is a substantial drawback when classes are discriminated by multiple patterns of varying strengths this phenomenon is common in the domain of proteinrna interactions as strong patterns e g u rich tracts present in binding_sites of many proteins may occlude weaker signals that discriminate between proteins a possible solution is to require the basis vectors found by nmf to be orthogonal one such example is the orthogonality constrained nmf that assumes an initial orthogonal model e g obtained by k_means which may bias the final model we have developed an integrative orthogonality regularized nonnegative_matrix method ionmf the method finds modular projections of data_matrices where data instances are assigned to modules described by non overlapping features in a supervised setting orthogonality regularization prevents multicollinearity where a feature_vector can be expressed as a linear combination of a subset of remaining feature_vectors this is important as rbps differ in specificity and their binding target patterns differ in number and strength we applied ionmf on the largest integrative_analysis in the number of rbps and different data_sources used the analysis included a compendium of published clip experiments on rbps and other genomic data_sources to predict rbp crosslinking sites at a nucleotide_resolution we discovered discriminative patterns across different data_sources and learned a comprehensive model of proteinrna interaction for each of the rbps we visualized the discovered patterns and used them to cluster rbps into functionally_related groups our results demonstrate the applicability of ionmf for fast and accurate prediction of rbp target_sites on a genome_wide scale computational_approaches already play_a in protein rna interaction prediction by aiding experiment planning and interpretation of results genome_wide assays of proteinrna interaction mapping has identified close to a thousand human rna_binding data on rna_binding is growing rapidly emphasizing the need for integrative methods which jointly consider all available data_sources an interesting finding of our study is that in addition to rna_structure and sequence the position relative to genomic_features exons etc and clip data of other rbps is informative for predicting binding_sites of a specific rbp genomic_regions are informative as many proteins bind at specific positions relative to these features e g u af generally binds upstream of exons we show that clip data are predictive as subsets of examined rbps exhibit similar binding_patterns supplementary figs s s and supplementary section s importantly overlap is only seen between a subset of rbps but we find no evidence that some sites or features are generally shared across all rbps while contribution of non specific background should be considered we find it most likely that co binding_profiles result from biologically relevant_features for example many rbps bind to similar rna_sequences or structures supplementary figs s s s several of the examined rbps are known to bind similar motifs such as the u rich motifs bound by elavl tia hnrnpc and u af which are also detected in our analyses moreover rbps may interact at the protein level either directly_or via co factors which could stabilize their binding to proximal rna sites few experimental_studies have explored the impact of protein_protein on coordinated rna_binding but our analyses could be used to explore such potential interactions in the future data_integration in ionmf yields improvements in accuracy when compared to state of the art approaches orthogonality regularization favors non overlapping and sparse solutions which are desired by domain_experts providing class specific descriptions and model interpretation the resulting predictions are in strong accordance with a published in vitro study and identified a number of promising candidates for further investigation together our experimental_findings establish ionmf as the data_integration technique of choice where sparse modular models are desired
