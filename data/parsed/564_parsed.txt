a system level investigation into the cellular toxic response mechanism mediated by ahr signal_transduction motivation viewing a cellular system as a collection of interacting parts can lead to new insights into the complex cellular_behavior in this study we have investigated aryl_hydrocarbon ahr signal_transduction from such a system level perspective ahr detects various xenobiotics such as drugs or endocrine_disruptors e g dioxin and mediates transcriptional_regulation of target_genes such as those in the cytochrome_p cyp family on binding with tetrachlorodibenzo_p tcdd however ahr becomes abnormally activated and conveys toxic_effects on cells despite many related studies on the tcdd mediated toxicity quantitative system level understanding of how tcdd mediated toxicity generates various toxic responses is still lacking results here we present a manually_curated tcdd mediated ahr signaling_pathway including crosstalks with the hypoxia pathway that copes with oxygen deficiency and the p pathway that induces a dna_damage based on the integrated pathway we have constructed a mathematical_model and validated it through quantitative experiments using the mathematical_model we have investigated i tcdd dose_dependent effects on ahr target_genes ii the crosstalk effect between ahr and hypoxia signals and iii p inhibition effect of tcdd liganded ahr our results show that cellular intake of tcdd induces ahr signaling_pathway to be abnormally up regulated and thereby interrupts other signaling_pathways interruption of hypoxia and p pathways in turn can incur various hazardous effects on cells taken together our study provides a system level understanding of how ahr signal mediates various tcdd induced toxicities under the presence of hypoxia and or dna_damage in cells cells are composed of well organized molecular_interaction to understand the response mechanism of a cell against an external stimulation we should not only identify the mediating signal_transduction but also investigate the dynamics accompanied with the signal_transmission this can be readily achieved using high_throughput techniques such as microarray_experiments but previous_studies indicated the problem of low reproducibility in such cases so we construct a mathematical_model for computer simulations by employing low_throughput techniques and investigate the dynamics of cell_signaling at a system level by combined analysis of computer simulations and biochemical experimentation based on the collection of biological or biochemical information about signaling_pathways induced by a specific stimulation we can construct the relevant molecular_interaction and further investigate the dynamics of the molecules involved in the network this might lead us to a system level understanding of the complex phenomena here we applied the idea to the ahr signaling_pathway to unravel the complicated signaling_pathway disruption by external stimulations aryl_hydrocarbon ahr is a member of the basic helix loophelix periodaryl hydrocarbon nuclear_translocator arnt single minded bhlh pas dna_binding protein_family although ahr is located in the cytosol bound to a molecular complex_composed of hsp xap and p upon binding with a ligand such as tcdd it is translocated to the nucleus and becomes heterodimerized with arnt after dissociated from the hsp xap p complex this liganded ahr arnt dimer binds to consensus regulatory_sequences of dna called dioxin response elements or xenobiotic response elements and transcribes the associated genes tetrachlorodibenzo_p tcdd is a specific type of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins also known as dioxin which is one group of the most toxic materials including dioxin like chemicals known so_far such as polychlorinated_dibenzofurans and biphenyls tcdd is used as a toxic standard evaluating the toxic equivalency factor tef value of dioxins and dioxin like chemicals to indicate the degree of toxicity tcdd is top_ranked with tef which is the highest value among the tested chemicals van den tcdd is a toxic standard for dioxin like chemicals because a number of evidences have been reported about its various hazardous effects on human_body liver and skin damages diabetes thyroid etc recent_studies also revealed that tcdd could be a potential carcinogen although various toxic_effects of tcdd have been studied for several decades its detailed molecular_mechanisms are still poorly_understood except the tcdd mediated transcriptional_regulation of ahr and its binding with arnt tcdd gets bio accumulated in fatty_tissue of human due to its hydrophobicity with wide individual variation of half_life years accumulated in fatty_tissue tcdd sustains ahr activation and causes the transcription of target_genes such as cyp a cytochrome_p family subfamily a polypeptide and ahrr ahr repressor gene in many cases the tcdd toxicity is strongly related to the accumulation of cyp a although there have been a number of studies to discover the downstream mechanism followed by this abnormal accumulation of cyp a it is still unclear how the downstream signals flow and what affects the cellular_toxicity conventional studies on toxic materials usually focus on a single particular aspect among various observed toxicities or phenomenological responses called doseresponse relationship in which the dose denotes the amount of a toxic substance and the response usually indicates the lethal rate of an organism however complex polygenic disease like cancer and diverse effects of toxic materials on living_organisms need a broader systems approach several recent_studies revealed that ahr may crosstalk with other signaling_pathways so that liganded ahr could affect other biological_functions in particular we note two previous studies_reporting that tcddliganded ahr inactivates p by increasing the basal_level of mdm protein not its mrna which is a well known e ubiquitin_ligase and arnt the counterpart of ahr binds with hypoxia_inducible hif a well known hypoxia responding protein arnt is one of the bhlh pas transcription_factor families arnt transcribes various genes after binding with hif or ahr to cope with toxic perturbations such as hypoxia or dioxin intake this suggests the possibility that arnt might play a limiting role in the competing signal_transmission between ahr and hifs these results indicate that tcdd might have some positive effect on carcinogenesis by disturbing the dna_damage signaling_pathways and the role of p and negative effect by competing with hif that transcribes genes related to angiogenesis under hypoxia hence there is a pressing need to do a system level study on these such that we can unravel the molecular_mechanism of various toxic responses produced by the tcdd mediated ahr signaling_pathway to our knowledge no attempt has been made to understand the complex regulatory_mechanism of tcdd mediated ahr pathway from an integrated system level perspective only a few review_papers described the overall schematic model of the ahr signaling_pathway without consideration of the crosstalks so we have reconstructed a comprehensive model of the ahr signaling_network through extensive manual_curation and developed a mathematical_model of it using odes based on biochemical_experiments our combined simulation analysis and experimental_validation of the model showed that ahr localization and its transcriptional_activity are dose_dependent and that they are influenced by hypoxia through the crosstalk with hif where arnt plays a role as a limiting_factor interestingly the hypoxia signaling inhibits the transcriptional_activity of ahr but the reverse is not true this might be originated from the different binding_affinities between ahr and arnt and hif and arnt we also found that the maximum_level of p changes as the levels of dna_damage and the tcdd intake vary in particular for low dna_damage the p level does not change much along with the tcdd intake and remains at a basal_level for high dna_damage tcdd attenuates the p response but the decrease is not enough and the transcription activity of p is
