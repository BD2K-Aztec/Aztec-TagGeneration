joint sparse canonical_correlation for detecting differential imaging_genetics modules motivation imaging_genetics combines brain_imaging and genetic_information to identify the relationships between genetic_variants and brain activities when the data samples belong to different classes e g disease status the relationships may exhibit class specific patterns that can be used to facilitate the understanding of a disease conventional approaches often perform separate analysis on each class and report the differences but ignore important shared patterns results in this paper we develop a multivariate method to analyze the differential dependency across multiple_classes we propose a joint sparse canonical_correlation method which uses a generalized fused_lasso penalty to jointly estimate multiple pairs of canonical vectors with both shared and class specific patterns using a data fusion approach the method is able to detect differentially correlated modules effectively and efficiently the results from simulation_studies demonstrate its higher accuracy in discovering both common and differential canonical correlations compared to conventional sparse cca using a schizophrenia dataset with cases and controls including a single_nucleotide snp_array and functional_magnetic data the proposed method reveals a set of distinct snp voxel interaction modules for the schizophrenia patients which are verified to be both statistically and biologically_significant imaging_genetics is an emerging field of study in brain research it aims to discover genetic_variants that explain brain activities providing more comprehensive_information that can hopefully inform the diagnosis and treatment of mental_disorders e g schizophrenia to date imaging and genomic_data are collected and both modalities include a large number of variables however how to combine the large amount of multi_modal data remains_a canonical_correlation cca and partial_least pls are common multivariate approaches to integrate two or more data types the basic idea is to maximize the correlation or covariances in pls between linear_combinations of variables from different data types to find the components that are associated with each other kernel cca and deep cca are extensions to extract nonlinear correlation between two datasets however in genomic and brain imaging_studies the dimension of the data is usually much higher than the sample_size as a result severe overfitting can occur when conventional cca methods are applied to address this problem penalized cca and related methods were introduced by employing sparse penalties to select a small number of features examples_include sparse cca sparse pls chun and keles and sparse reduced rank regression which have been demonstrated to be effective in detecting multivariate genomic and brain_imaging associations to incorporate biological prior_knowledge and data_structures to guide the search of associations group scca and network guided sparse reduced rank regression were proposed which can further improve variable_selection in all the above methods a common_assumption is that the data are collected from the same distributions however in real imaging genetic_studies the data are collected from subjects corresponding to different disease statuses e g the schizophrenia patients and healthy_controls a separate estimation will suffer a lack of power due to the limited size of each individual class but a simple combination of the data may miss the identification of the heterogeneity of the interactions therefore it is desirable to discover both the common and class specific interactions simultaneously by joint analysis of multi class data in a statistical_method was proposed to jointly study mirna gene interactions from multiple_cancers however this method is restricted to univariate inference that is not able to detect complex multivariate correlations a challenge was also recognized in that the direct_application of sparse multivariate_methods may choose different sets of interaction pairs for each class especially for sparse cca similar patterns may appear in different orders leading to the problem of mismatch during joint analysis across classes in this paper we propose a novel sparse cca method to jointly estimate multiple cca models corresponding to different classes as illustrated inwith two types of data from k classes the main idea is to find a common sparse linear combination of the variables from one type of data for example the imaging data and k joint sparse linear_combinations from the other type e g the genomic_data to maximize the summed correlation in this way the method can obtain the brain_regions that are important for all classes and discover their differential interactions with the genetic_variants specifically by restricting the imaging canonical variables to be common across classes the method overcomes the problem of mismatch that can make full combination of the data from multiple_classes see we also apply a fused_lasso penalty on the k canonical vectors for genetic data to encourage them to share a similar but not the same structure the fused_lasso penalty is chosen because it has been successfully_applied to jointly estimate multiple graphical_models to find differential dependency networks inspired by the optimization framework for penalized cca in we design an efficient algorithm based on block coordinate descent for solving jscca the jscca is featured as a multivariate method for joint interactions analysis promising to detect complicated abnormal interaction modules between genomic_variants and brain activities we first apply the proposed method to the simulation_data containing three classes through a comprehensive comparison we demonstrate the effectiveness of jscca in discovering both shared and class specific correlations next we apply the jscca method to a schizophrenia dataset with cases and controls the data include functional_magnetic fmri and single_nucleotide snp data collected by the mind clinical imaging consortium we found a number of snp voxel modules with significantly_increased correlation for schizophrenia patients the rest of the paper is organized as follows section introduces the joint sparse cca method the performance of the proposed method is evaluated through both simulations and real_data analysis in section followed by some discussions and concluding_remarks in the last section the main contributions of the present paper can be summarized as follows first we propose a jscca method which can discover relationship among data from observations corresponding to distinct classes to infer their common and different association patterns second we present an efficient algorithm to solve the model third we study the numerical performance of jscca via a series of simulations our results show that an appropriate fusion of multiple data can improve the detection_accuracy of both common and differential associations finally we applied the proposed method to the analysis of schizophrenia data we discovered some novel abnormal interactions between a group of snps with some interesting brain_regions the differential interaction can infer some important information on how the dysfunction of genesbrain interactions can imply the risk of schizophrenia the interpretation of these interactions should be further confirmed via replications and additional biological evidences which needs further research
