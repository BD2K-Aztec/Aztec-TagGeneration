sequence_analysis global sequence characterization of rice centromeric satellite based on oligomer frequency analysis in large_scale sequencing_data satellite dna makes up significant portion of many eukaryotic_genomes yet it is relatively poorly_characterized even in extensively sequenced species this is in part due to methodological_limitations of traditional_methods of satellite repeat analysis which are based on multiple_alignments of monomer sequences therefore we employed an alternative alignment_free approach utilizing k_mer frequency statistics which is in principle more suitable for analyzing_large sets of satellite repeat data including sequence_reads from next_generation results k_mer frequency_spectra were determined for two sets of rice centromeric satellite cento sequences including reads from chip sequencing of cenh bound_dna mb and the whole_genome sanger sequencing_reads mb k_mer frequencies were used to identify the most conserved sequence_regions and to reconstruct consensus_sequences of complete monomers reconstructed consensus_sequences as well as the assessment of overall divergence of k_mer spectra revealed high similarity of the two datasets suggesting that cento sequences associated with functional centromeres cenh bound do not significantly differ from the total population of cento which includes both centromeric and pericentromeric repeat arrays on the other hand considerable_differences were revealed when these methods were used for comparison of cento populations between individual chromosomes of the rice genome_assembly demonstrating preferential sequence homogenization of the clusters within the same chromosome k_mer frequencies were also successfully used to identify and characterize smrnas derived from cento repeats highly abundant tandemly arranged dna_repeats referred to as satellite dna are among the major constituents of complex to whom correspondence should be addressed eukaryotic_genomes they are composed of basic repeated units or monomers which are usually only tens to hundreds of nucleotides_long however they can be amplified to millions of copies making up to of plant nuclear_dna and even higher proportions in some insect or rodent genomes up to megabase sized arrays of head_to arranged monomers constitute specific_genomic appearing as heterochromatic bands or spots on mitotic_chromosomes or interphase_nuclei satellite repeats are among the most dynamic components of eukaryotic_genomes undergoing_rapid changes in their sequences and abundance which often result in emergence of genus specific or even species specific repeats in contrast to this rapid inter specific diversification monomers of a given satellite are usually highly homogenized within a species as a result of their concerted_evolution this uniformity together with the genomic_organization of satellite repeats into long contiguous arrays represent serious obstacles to their investigation using conventional cloning and sequencing_approaches consequently large_proportions of satellite sequences are left out from genome_assemblies even in extensively_studied model species as the number of genomes investigated using large_scale sequencing increases there is a mounting amount of unexplored satellite sequence_data available in the repositories of unassembled reads this increase has recently been accelerated by the development of next_generation which have made whole_genome possible in a wide_range of species all these sequencing_projects generate a wealth of data which if properly analyzed could be used to investigate the patterns of intra_and specific evolution of satellite repeats sequence_analysis of satellite dna is traditionally based on a definition of basic repeated units monomers or higher_order repeats which are subjected to pairwise or multiple_sequence to assess their similarities while this approach is intuitive and in many respects convenient it also includes several drawbacks i it is prone to bias introduced by subjective decisions when defining individual repeat_units within a longer sequence especially in the case of less conserved repeats ii processing large_amounts of sequence_data in this way is laborious and iii multiple_sequence are feasible only with up to hundreds of monomers as computational and visualization constraints arepage
