an integrative clustering and modeling algorithm for dynamical gene_expression data motivation the precise dynamics of gene_expression is often crucial for proper response to stimuli time course gene_expression can provide insights about the dynamics of many cellular_responses but are often noisy and measured at arbitrary intervals posing a major analysis challenge results we developed an algorithm that interleaves clustering time course gene_expression data with estimation of dynamic_models of their response by biologically_meaningful parameters in combining these two tasks we overcome obstacles posed in each one moreover our approach provides an easy way to compare between responses to different stimuli at the dynamical level we use our approach to analyze the dynamical transcriptional_responses to inflammation and anti_viral stimuli in mice primary dendritic_cells and extract a concise representation of the different dynamical response types we analyze the similarities and differences between the two stimuli and identify potential_regulators of this complex transcriptional_response availability the code to our method is freely availableunderstanding a complex transcriptional_response to stimuli is a key goal in biological_research such a response involves a timely activation and repression of hundreds of genes requiring a tight and accurate regulation for example the transcriptional_response to inflammation in immune_cells in mice is regulated by at least a dozen transcription_factors operating through different modes of activation including fast responding factors e g nfb and secondary response factors synthesized de_novo during the response e g irf resulting in a wide_range of dynamical transcriptional_responses thus to fully understand the transcriptional_response a static analysis indicating which genes are induced at one given time point is not sufficient and it is important to analyze the transcriptional dynamics of the induced genes a widely used approach to study transcription dynamics is by collecting time course measurements of gene_expression in predefined time points following a stimuli a possible concern in analysis of such data is the inherent limitation of gene_expression these are exacerbated by the temporal aspects of the datathe chosen time points might not capture the interval in which a gene is up regulated as a result this data is often difficult to analyze and the comparison between experiments carried over different time courses is non trivial in the literature there are several approaches for analysis of timecourse data one approach is to cluster the data so that every cluster captures a group of genes with similar dynamical response this can be done using traditional clustering_algorithms such as k mean however the standard distance functions are not adequate to handle the given data which is sampled at various non uniformly_distributed time points several works addressed this specific task addressed this obstacle by assigning genes to a preselected set of potential profiles however the set of potential profiles are not selected from the data and might contain profiles that do not represent true biological_responses an additional obstacle is that the clustering is done on the noisy and missing expression_patterns of genes which might lead to false assignments to clusters thus an unbiased clustering_algorithm fitted for this type of data is needed an alternative approach is to consider a mathematical_model of the response dynamics and then fit it to measurements this in effect translates the discrete measurements to a continuous function from a biologically_plausible family of functions moreover the parameters of this class of functions can be biologically_relevant and mark the important aspects of the dynamics e g point of induction for example the impulse model proposed by is designed to capture the typical impulse like response to a stimulus using a function with biologically_meaningful parameters a problem with models such as this one is that they have many parameters and can lead to overfitting over a typically small number of time points in addition the modeling is done per individual gene thus clustering is still necessary to obtain a concise representation of the dynamical responses types here we present dynamitec dynamic modeling and clustering an integrative approach that simultaneously models time course gene_expression with biologically_meaningful parameters and assigns them to clusters of different dynamical responses our approach is to model gene responses using an impulse model our premise is that many genes have a similar response thus instead of estimating the profile of each gene separately and thus risk overfitting our method estimates the profile with a prior that prefers to match one out of a set of prototype responses we thus pose the parameter_estimation taskas jointly learning the prototypes and the parameters of individual genes when learning these prototypes we in fact assign genes to clusters these two problems are solved by iterating between them we used dynamitec to study the responses to two related stimuli in mice primary dendritic_cells that simulate either inflammation lps stimulus and anti viral_infection polyic stimulus in their experiment collected gene_expression of a dense time course following the stimulus we show that our revised impulse model and algorithm result in a good fit for the induced genes and meaningful clusters we reveal distinct types of dynamical response to stimulation and compare between genes that have the same dynamical response under both conditions and other genes that change their response dynamics in addition we point out potential transcription_factors that could regulate this complex transcriptional_response time series expression data are a valuable_approach to study the dynamics of the transcriptional_response to a stimuli here we provide tools to address the challenge of analyzing such complex data our dynamitec method is an integrative approach where we use a simple two impulse model to describe the response dynamics and at the same time cluster the data so that every cluster captures a group of genes with similar dynamics by exploiting the fact that most responses contain groups of co regulated_genes with a similar behavior we can estimate a set of prototypical responses in our function space and use them as a meaningful prior when estimating the parameters for individual genes as a consequence our method avoids overfitting and is more robust to measurement noise while still fitting each gene with specific parameters in addition we cluster the genes into meaningful dynamical clusters according to the typical prototype prior we learn for each gene we validated our results first on synthetic data demonstrating our robustness to noise to a small number of samples and to non uniform sampling to demonstrate the properties of our method we applied dynamitec to a dataset describing the response to two related but distinct stimuli of immune_cells as we show the resulting clusters capture distinct parts of the immune_response that represent separate biological_functions and are regulated by different overlapping cis_regulatory moreover we show that the estimated model_parameters are biologically_meaningful and allow us to provide a finer description of the differences between the two stimuli taken more broadly we apply the general theme of parameter sharing between genes to reduce overfitting when estimating the dynamics at the level of each gene this theme can be realizedpage i i i
