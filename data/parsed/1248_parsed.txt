sequence_analysis dafs simultaneous aligning and folding of rna_sequences via dual decomposition motivation it is well known that the accuracy of rna_secondary from a single_sequence is limited and thus a comparative_approach that predicts a common secondary_structure from aligned sequences is a better choice if homologous_sequences with reliable alignments are available however correct secondary_structure information is needed to produce reliable alignments of rna_sequences to tackle this dilemma we require a fast and accurate aligner that takes structural_information into consideration to yield reliable structural_alignments which are suitable for common secondary_structure results we develop dafs a novel algorithm that simultaneously aligns and folds rna_sequences based on maximizing expected_accuracy of a predicted common secondary_structure and its alignment dafs decomposes the pairwise_structural problem into two independent secondary_structure prediction_problems and one pairwise non structural_alignment problem by the dual decomposition technique and maintains the consistency of a pairwise_structural by imposing penalties on inconsistent base_pairs and alignment columns that are iteratively updated furthermore we extend dafs to consider pseudoknots in rna structural_alignments by integrating ipknot for predicting a pseudoknotted structure the experiments on publicly_available datasets showed that dafs can produce reliable structural_alignments from unaligned sequences in terms of accuracy of common secondary_structure availability the program of dafs and the datasets are available atmany functional rnas form secondary_structures that are related to their functions such as gene_regulation and maturation of mrnas rrnas and trnas therefore analysis of rna_secondary can lead to unraveling their potential functions since experimental determination of rna_secondary is expensive_and computational_prediction of rna_secondary has been frequently used the most successful methods for predicting rna_secondary from a single_sequence are based on minimizing free_energy such as mfold and rnafold alternative_methods are based on probabilistic frameworks including stochastic_context that can model rna_secondary without pseudoknots crossing base_pairs on primary sequences several computational_methods based on stochastic_context have been developed for modeling and analyzing non_coding nonetheless the accuracy of rna_secondary from a single_sequence is known to be limited and thus a comparative_approach that predicts a common secondary_structure from aligned sequences is a better choice if homologous_sequences with reliable alignments are available comparative_methods based on alignment folding include rnaalifold pfold petfold and centroidalifold however we require correct secondary_structure information to produce reliable alignments of rna_sequences in turn which is a chicken and egg problem to tackle this dilemma sankoff has proposed a dynamic programing dp algorithm for simultaneously aligning and folding rna_sequences whose computational_complexity is ol n time and ol n space for n sequences of length l since a navenave implementation of the sankoff algorithm is impractical because of unrealistic computational_complexity various algorithms have been developed to reduce the computational_complexity of the sankoff algorithm several pioneering studies including the first versions of foldalign and dynalign have implemented restricted sankoff algorithms foldalign disallows bifurcated structures and dynalign assumes the maximum distance of aligned nucleotides note that later versions of both methods do not have such restrictions several succeeding methods have reduced the search_space of the sankoff algorithm by to whom correspondence should be addressed using precomputed posterior_probabilities of base_pairs and or aligned columns sampling based_approaches instead of reducing the search_space have also been developed zivhave proposed a sparsification technique for the sankoff algorithm that speeds up computation by a linear factor although various techniques for reducing the computation time have been developed the sankoff style algorithms are still computationally_expensive alternatively several heuristic based_algorithms that do not strictly perform simultaneous aligning and folding of rna_sequences have been proposed such as sequence_alignment with a structural scoring_function and stem based alignment lara proposed byformulates the problem of rna structural_alignment as a graph theoretical_model for sequence_alignment with additional simple structure information lagrangian relaxation is applied to relax the constraints for the structure information then the problem is solved as sequence_alignment with iterative updates of penalty scores note that lara was not designed to predict common secondary_structures since no folding model is explicitly considered in this article we present a novel algorithm dafs that performs dual decomposition for aligning and folding rna_sequences simultaneously first on the basis of the maximizing expected_accuracy mea principle we design an objective_function for a pairwise_structural as the expectation of the sum of the numbers of correctly_predicted base_pairs in a common secondary_structure and those of correctly aligned columns in its pairwise_alignment then to maximize the objective_function under several constraints for consistent pairwise_structural we use the dual decomposition technique which decomposes the pairwise_structural problem into two independent secondary_structure prediction_problems and one pairwise non structural_alignment problem the algorithm maintains the consistency of a pairwise_structural by imposing penalties on inconsistent base_pairs and alignment columns and updates them iteratively by performing the nussinov style secondary_structure and the needlemanwunsch style pairwise_alignment with the penalized scoring_function we easily extend the algorithm to perform multiple_alignment by applying a standard progressive alignment technique furthermore we integrate the ipknot model instead of the nussinov model so that dafs can simultaneously align and fold rna_sequences with pseudoknots major_advantages of dafs are summarized as follows i dafs is a fast and accurate implementation that simultaneously aligns and folds rna_sequences compared with the other sankoff style algorithms dafs achieves comparable accuracy and even more importantly runs much faster compared with the heuristic based_approaches such as sequence_alignment with structural scores dafs is more accurate especially in terms of common secondary_structure ii dafs is flexible and extensible because of the dual decomposition which enables us to integrate state of the art folding models such as the ipknot model for pseudoknotted secondary_structures we developed a fast and accurate rna structural aligner called dafs that simultaneously aligns and folds rna_sequences by dual decomposition specifically our method decomposes the rna structural_alignment problem into three subproblems then respective problems are solved by simple and efficient algorithms such as the nussinov style dp and the needleman wunsch style dp this means that dafs can explicitly take the folding model into account whereas lara that has also used lagrangian relaxation cannot in fact we showed that the dual decomposition technique_enables us to integrate state of the art folding models such as the ipknot model for pseudoknotted structures this flexibility to adapt the folding models to our algorithm would lead us to further improvement by using an extended secondary_structure model such as rnawolf zu where base_pairing probabilities for extended secondary_structures are used one of the other differences between dafs and lara is the scoring system in the objective_function the scoring system of dafs is based on the mea principle which has been successfully_applied to various problems in bioinformatics time means the total computation time in seconds measured on a linux workstation with intel_xeon e ghz the bold values indicate the best score in each evaluation measure for all the methods except dafs sen ppv and mcc are calculated using common secondary_structures predicted by centroidalifold with default_parameters from produced alignments see section s in supplementary_material for the results using rnaalifold and intrinsic predictions the mea based scoring_function not only improves accuracy in prediction but also makes dafs run fast by the threshold cut technique which is derived from the ip formulation based on the mea based scoring_function described in section the threshold cut technique has also been applied to ractip and ipknot and has contributed to their accuracy and efficiency prediction_accuracy of dafs depends mainly on its scoring_functions even though the method uses the approximate probability_distribution for rna structural_alignments that assumes independence of alignment and structure in fact experimental_results shown in section s in supplementary_material revealed that when we adopted the exact posterior_probabilities for rna structural_alignments a significant_improvement was confirmed though much computation time was spent on the predictions considering these results there is room for further investigation into refinement of the scoring_functions that make prediction_accuracy compatible with practical running time
