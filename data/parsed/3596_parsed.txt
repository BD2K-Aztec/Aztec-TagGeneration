poly a motif prediction using spectral latent features from human dna_sequences motivation polyadenylation is the addition of a poly a tail to an rna_molecule identifying dna_sequence that signal the addition of poly a tails is essential to improved genome_annotation and better understanding of the regulatory_mechanisms and stability of mrna existing poly a motif predictors demonstrate that information extracted from the surrounding nucleotide_sequences of candidate poly a motifs can differentiate true motifs from the false ones to a great extent a variety of sophisticated features has been explored including sequential structural statistical thermodynamic and evolutionary properties however most of these methods involve extensive manual feature engineering which can be time consuming and can require in depth domain_knowledge results we propose a novel machine_learning for poly a motif prediction by marrying generative learning hidden_markov and discriminative learning support_vector generative learning provides a rich palette on which the uncertainty and diversity of sequence_information can be handled while discriminative learning allows the performance of the classification task to be directly optimized here we used hidden_markov for fitting the dna_sequence dynamics and developed an efficient spectral algorithm for extracting latent_variable information from these models these spectral latent features were then fed into support_vector to fine_tune the classification_performance we evaluated our proposed method on a comprehensive human poly a dataset that consists of samples from of the most abundant variants of human poly a motifs compared with one of the previous state of the art methods in the literature the random_forest with expert crafted features our method reduces the average error_rate false_negative and false_positive by and respectively meanwhile our method makes fewer error predictions relative to the other string kernels furthermore our method can be used to visualize the importance of oligomers and positions in predicting poly a motifs from which we can observe a number of characteristics in the surrounding regions of true and false motifs that have not been reported before roughly speaking when dna is transcribed to rna a string of adenine a nucleotides referred to as the polyadenylation tail or the poly a tail is added to the end of the primary rna_transcript such a process is called polyadenylation which is a step to protect rna_stability nuclear_export and translation a poly a tail is nt downstream of a signaling site that consists of nt which in human cells most commonly is aauaaa this signaling site is known as a poly a signal and the corresponding nt subsequences in dna are called poly a motifs mutations in poly a signals can be associated with diseases e g colorectal_cancer and compromised immunodeficiency the poly a signal prediction_problem has been studied for decades there are two versions of the problem predicting poly a signals in mrna_sequences and predicting poly a motifs in dna_sequences intuitively the former version is much simpler than the latter one because once the mrna sequence is given the poly a tail can be identified relatively easily and we need only to search for the poly a signal s in a window of at most nt upstream the poly a tail in dna however the presence of introns in eukaryotes and the absence of poly a tails make the recognition much more challenging a number of studies have demonstrated that information from relatively short upstream and downstream sequences of the candidate poly a motifs can specify the true poly a motifs to a great extent statistical_properties of the surrounding sequences were explored in different species such as yeast van fly arabidopsis and rice and human although significant progress has been made to the accuracy of poly a motif predictors especially in human dna_sequences such methods are all based on using sophisticated features that require additional efforts to extract and are highly dependent on domain_knowledge we therefore ask the following question can we use machine_learning to automatically extract useful features from human dna_sequences and achieve state of the art poly a motif classification results if the answer to this question is yes then we can automate this

our understanding of the underlying biology automatic feature extraction_techniques have been explored in many other sequence classification_problems by far the most successful methods are hidden_markov hmms e g in gene_finding and string kernels with support_vector svm e g in protein classification transcription_start recognition and splice_site prediction the former methods are generative_models that capture the uncertainty in data using probabilistic languages while the latter are discriminative methods that optimize specifically for the classification results the advantages of each class of methods have rarely been combined systematically to yield even better feature extractors in this article we propose a novel method for poly a motif prediction by marrying generative learning hmms and discriminative learning svms generative learning provides us with a rich palette for handling the uncertainty and diversity of sequence_information while discriminative learning allows us to directly optimize performance for the classification task here diversity means that for the same position in the surrounding sequence of a candidate poly a motif there may be multiple subsequences indicating the class label a true motif or a false one and uncertainty means that each of these subsequences does not give deterministic information about the class label in particular we use hmms as a probabilistic generative_model for dna_sequences and develop an efficient spectral algorithm for extracting latent_variable information from these models the hmms model not only the diversity and uncertainty of sequence_information but also long_range dependencies between subsequences at different positions which cannot be simultaneously captured by string kernels as is discussed in section the spectral latent features are then fed into support_vector to fine_tune the classification_performance
