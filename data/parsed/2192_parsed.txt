high order neural_networks and kernel methods for peptide mhc binding prediction motivation effective computational_methods for peptide protein binding prediction can greatly help clinical peptide vaccine search and design however previous computational methods_fail to capture key nonlinear high order dependencies between different amino_acid as a result they often produce low quality rankings of strong binding_peptides to solve this problem we propose nonlinear high order machine_learning including high order neural_networks honns with possible deep extensions and high order kernel support_vector to predict major_histocompatibility peptide binding results the proposed high order methods improve quality of binding predictions over other prediction_methods with the proposed methods a significant gain of up to is observed on the benchmark and reference peptide_datasets and tasks in addition for the first time our experiments show that pre training with high order semi restricted boltzmann machines significantly_improves the performance of feed_forward honns moreover our experiments show that the proposed shallow honn outperform the popular pre trained deep neural_network on most tasks which demonstrates the effectiveness of modelling high order feature interactions for predicting major histo compatibility complex peptide binding availability_and there is no associated distributable software complex biological_functions in living_cells are often performed through different types of proteinprotein_interactions an important class of proteinprotein_interactions are peptide i e short chains of amino_acids mediated_interactions and they regulate important biological_processes such as protein_localization endocytosis post_translational signalling_pathways and immune_responses etc moreover peptide mediated_interactions play_important in the development of several human_diseases and viral_infections because of the high medical value of peptide protein interactions a lot of research has been done to identify ideal peptides for therapeutic and cosmetic purposes which renders in silico peptide protein binding prediction by computational_methods an important problem in immunomics and bioinformatics in this article we propose novel machine_learning to study a specific type of peptide protein interaction i e the interaction between peptides and major_histocompatibility mhc i proteins although our methods can be readily_applicable to other types of peptide protein interactions peptide mhc i protein interactions are essential in cell_mediated regulation of immune_responses transplant_rejection and vaccine_design therefore effective computational_methods for peptide mhc i binding prediction will significantly reduce_cost and time in clinical peptide vaccine search and design previous computational_approaches to predicting peptide mhc interactions are mainly based on linear or bi linear_models and they fail to capture key non linear high order dependencies between different amino_acid although previous kernel support_vector svm and neural_network netmhc approaches can capture nonlinear interactions between input_features they fail to model the direct strong high order interactions between features as a result the quality of the peptide rankings produced by previous methods is not good producing high_quality rankings of peptide vaccine_candidates is essential to the successful deployment of computational_methods for vaccine_design for this purpose we need to effectively model direct non linear high order feature interactions to directly capture interactions between primary anchor and secondary amino_acid involved in the formation of peptide_mhc deep_learning models such as deep neural_networks dnns pretrained with restricted boltzmann machine rbm have been successfully_applied to handwritten digit classification embedding image_recognition and many other applications but they have never been successfully_applied to peptide protein interaction problems in this article we propose using high order semi rbms to pretrain a feed_forward high order neural_network honn and propose high order kernel svm for peptide mhc binding prediction including identification of mhc binding naturally processed and presented npp and immunogenic peptides t cell epitopes our proposed models achieved a significant gain of up to over the state_ofthe approach on benchmark and reference peptide_datasets and tasks furthermore our shallow honns even outperformed popular powerful pre trained dnns that was applied to model peptide mhc binding prediction for the first time by this work we first present results for mhc i binding prediction on benchmark_datasets and experimental_data from our lab section we show next results on predicting peptides np by the mhc pathway section finally we show results for predicting promising t cell epitopes for clinical development section the following auc and ndcg scores are shown in percentage
