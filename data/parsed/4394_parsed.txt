ssbd a database of quantitative data of spatiotemporal_dynamics of biological_phenomena motivation rapid advances in live_cell analysis and mathematical_modeling have produced a large amount of quantitative data on spatiotemporal_dynamics of biological objects ranging from molecules to organisms there is now a crucial need to bring these large_amounts of quantitative_biological together centrally in a coherent and systematic manner this will facilitate the reuse of this data for further analysis results we have developed the systems science of biological dynamics database ssbd to store and share quantitative_biological ssbd currently provides sets of quantitative data for single_molecules nuclei and whole organisms in a wide_variety of model_organisms from escherichia_coli to mus_musculus the data are provided in biological dynamics markup_language format and also through a rest api in addition ssbd provides sets of time lapse microscopy_images from which the quantitative data were obtained and software_tools for data visualization and analysis availability_and ssbd is accessible at http ssbd qbic riken jp one of the leading challenges of systems_biology is to understand the nature of the dynamical behaviors of biological_phenomena recent_progress in live_cell imaging_techniques has produced a large amount of microscopy_images showing the spatiotemporal_dynamics of biological objects such as single_molecules nuclei cells and organisms computational image_analysis techniques can quantitatively extract numerical_data from these microscopy_images these quantitative_biological can then be analyzed further to provide crucial insight into the nature of dynamical behaviors of biological_phenomena many sets of quantitative_biological have been obtained from various kinds of microscopy_images for example extracted quantitative data of nuclear_division dynamics in green_fluorescent labeled embryos using confocal_microscopy with the aim of deciphering the cell_lineage in caenorhabditis_elegans extracted quantitative data of nuclear_division dynamics in c elegans_embryos under a wide_variety of gene perturbations from differential_interference microscopy_images to understand molecular_mechanisms in early embryogenesis similarly quantitative data of nuclear_division dynamics in embryos were obtained for drosophila_melanogaster and danio_rerio using digital scanned laser light_sheet these quantitative data allowed a comprehensive analysis of cell_division patterns during embryogenesis extracted quantitative data of behavioral dynamics of adult c elegans to understand how genes influence behavior and locomotion quantitative_biological can be reused for further analysis of dynamical behaviors of biological_phenomena however only a few existing datasets have been reused even though most are publicly_available for example quantitative data of nuclear_division dynamics in d rerio embryos produced bywere reused to analyze spatial_organization of cells with the use of newly_developed information metrics and quantitative data of nuclear_division dynamics in c elegans_embryos were reused to evaluate image_processing methods for nuclear detection there are two reasons for the low rate of data reuse one is that the data are usually dispersed on individual websites across the internet so researchers often find it difficult to know what kinds of data are available the other reason is that incompatible data_formats create a barrier for other researchers to reuse the data because studying each individual format takes additional time and effort recent_progress in mathematical_modeling techniques has provided an opportunity to perform mechanobiological simulations which also generate quantitative data quantitative data of spatiotemporal_dynamics of single_molecules in an escherichia_coli cell were generated to elucidate the mechanism of pole to pole oscillations of target_proteins data of microtubule_dependent pronuclear migration in early c elegans_embryos were generated to reveal the mechanism of the nuclear centering process in such simulation_studies data from computer simulations are often compared with in vivo dynamic_patterns from biological_experiments to evaluate the model validity once a plausible model is created the model can predict dynamical behaviors over a range of parameter_values the deviation in predictions can be reused leading to further experiments and refinement of the models however such kinds of quantitative data from computer simulation are neither stored nor shared there is now a crucial need to bring large_amounts of quantitative data of spatiotemporal_dynamics together centrally in a coherent and systematic manner to facilitate the reuse of the data for further analysis several research groups are developing central databases that store and share data in the field of bioimage_informatics the cell image library and the image data repository http idrdemo openmicroscopy org store and share microscopy_images with meta_information however these databases mainly focus on microscopy_images and do not store and share quantitative data extracted from images the biostudies database stores and shares meta_information of biological studies and it provides links to data_sources for a wide_range of biological_datasets moreover there are also several databases that provide quantitative_biological in the field of computer simulation however these databases were very specific for storing data from molecular_dynamics simulations and biochemical kinetic simulations thus far there is no central_database that stores and shares quantitative data of spatiotemporal_dynamics obtained from bioimage_informatics techniques or mechanobiological modeling techniques in this paper we present the systems science of biological dynamics database ssbd http ssbd qbic riken jp for storing and sharing quantitative_biological this database is developed and maintained with support from japans national bioscience database center nbdc http biosciencedbc jp en as a part of the life_science database integration project in japan http biosciencedbc jp en about us projects and activities nbdc is part of the japan science and technology agency jst the ministry of education culture sports science and technology of japan mext requests all researchers in the life_sciences in japan to provide their data to support the project ssbd was developed to sustainably store and share quantitative_biological that are created by the japanese science community and beyond it provides users with central access to quantitative data and the microscopy_images from which the quantitative data were obtained it also provides additional software_tools for data visualization and analysis ssbd is a database for storing and sharing quantitative_biological for biological objects of various scales ranging from single_molecules to organisms over sets of quantitative data of biological dynamics can be reused in bdml formatted files and through the ssbd rest api as an example of the reuse of data in ssbd we examined time dependent proliferation patterns during embryogenesis in several model_organisms the data can also be reused for comparative_analysis for example we can directly compare the data from different laboratories when the data pertains to the same biological_phenomena in the same model_organism moreover we can compare data obtained from related or different species to reveal similar and different features furthermore we might combine different types of data such as cell_morphology and protein activity data to explore the relationship between the underlying biophysical and biochemical changes we store simulation_results within ssbd enabling direct comparison with quantitative data extracted from biological_experiments comparison between the extracted data under gene perturbation and the simulation_results with perturbed parameters may provide a mechanistic insight into gene function however it is difficult to determine what type of simulation_results should be stored and shared because an infinite number of simulation_results can be generated by varying each parameter in a mathematical_model it may be appropriate to store and share the computer programs and mathematical_models that produce the results in the future meanwhile we plan to store simulation_results that are expensive to produce for example simulations that take months to run on a supercomputer these results cannot be easily reproduced in researchers individual laboratories data quality_control is a major_problem in most biological_databases and ssbd encounters the same problem however ssbd is different from other databases such as genome and gene_expression databases because it also stores the original microscopy_images from which the quantitative_biological were obtained by visually checking the quantitative data with the original microscopy image data one can directly evaluate the quality of the quantitative data online and offline visualization_tools are available in ssbd enabling easy evaluation of the data_quality microscopy_images stored in ssbd can provide new opportunities for computational_biologists especially those in the field of bioimage_informatics it is possible to develop new methods for extracting quantitative data of new biological objects from existing microscopy_images because these images often contain information that the original study did not focus on or utilize other possibilities include the development of new or improved methods for extracting quantitative data of the same biological objects examined in the original study the performance of these new methods can then be evaluated by comparing their output with the data stored in ssbd the broad bioimage benchmark collection bbbc is a database for storing annotated microscopy image sets for testing image_processing methods each image_set is provided with the corresponding quantitative data such as contours of biological objects extracted by image_analysis bbbc aims to improve image_processing for biological microscopy whereas ssbd aims to provide quantitative biological resources for bioinformaticians and computational_biologists to further advance biological_research it might be possible for the bbbc and ssbd projects to collaborate and share a similar software platform to enhance image_processing as well as to provide quantitative data resources for biologists in the future we distributed an open_source version of ssbd openssbd as a software platform for managing quantitative_biological it has the essential functions of ssbd with a browser_based simple interactive d viewer and the same rest api for accessing data several groups have developed open_source platforms that can manage numerical information of biological dynamics the omero platform was developed primarily to manage microscopy_images but it can also manage quantitative data pertaining to regions of interest rois based on the d geometric models in ome however a limitation of omero is that it cannot use d geometric models such as spheres and faces in bdml the openbis platform was developed to manage biological_research data including microscopy_images and numerical information from high_content however openbis is not suitable for managing spatiotemporal information about biological dynamics all these other platforms do not provide an interactive d viewer for quantitative data because they are not specialized for storing and sharing quantitative data therefore openssbd is a unique software platform for managing quantitative_biological openssbd enables research groups to develop their own databases to store and share their quantitative data the distribution of openssbd could result in acceleration of data_sharing with the data bazaar approach although it could also lead to data scattering across the internet to avoid such data scattering a community_based effort for managing data_integration is indispensable for instance a central_database could be used to store and share at least the meta_information about all the quantitative data including their download sites if all quantitative data are managed under the control of the community data storage processing and download services can be dispersed throughout the databases managed by research groups in the community ssbd can be viewed as a data factory approach currently it uses a central_database to store and share all quantitative_biological created by the japanese scientific_community however an international community_based effort is required for efficient effective and sustainable data_sharing in the era of open science ssbd is a unique database that enables scientists in a wide_variety of fields to reuse the large amount of quantitative_biological obtained from biological_experiments and computer simulations ssbd will support promote and contribute to advances in systems_biology and various interdisciplinary research_fields and facilitate data_driven biology
