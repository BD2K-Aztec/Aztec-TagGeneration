data_and vacceed a high_throughput in silico vaccine_candidate discovery pipeline for eukaryotic pathogens based on reverse vaccinology we present vacceed a highly configurable and scalable framework designed to automate the process of high_throughput in silico vaccine_candidate discovery for eukaryotic pathogens given thousands of protein_sequences from the target pathogen as input the main output is a ranked_list of protein candidates determined by a set of machine_learning vacceed has the potential to save time and money by reducing the number of false candidates allocated for laboratory validation vacceed if required can also predict protein_sequences from the pathogens genome availability_and vacceed is tested on linux and can be freely downloaded from https github com sgoodswe vacceed re leases includes a worked example with sample data vacceed user guide can be obtained from https github com sgoodswe vacceed several subunit_vaccines against prokaryotic pathogens have been identified using reverse vaccinology vaxign and nerve are examples of vaccine discovery tools for prokaryotes but there is currently no equivalent tool for eukaryotes freely_available bioinformatics_tools and an unprecedented volume of omics_data now present an opportunity for in silico vaccine discovery for eukaryotic pathogens a general approach is to use several tools to predict and gather_evidence for protein characteristics from this potential evidence the researcher makes an informed decision as to a proteins vaccine candidacy suitability determining which tools are appropriate as well as how to use them presents the first of many challenges a further challenge especially to a researcher with limited programming ability is to extract and gather the pertinent evidence distributed within large_scale outputs the subsequent and more imposing challenge is that the evidence is mainly in different formats contradicting and inaccurate poor evidence reliability arises because some of the input_data to the tools e g protein_sequences and training data are inaccurate or missing moreover tools used to predict protein characteristics are in general inaccurate vaccine_candidates identified in silico can only be validated in a laboratory validation should provide feedback to inform and improve vaccine candidacy decision_making the repetitive nature for this ideal in silico approach is in need of automation furthermore an automated process must accommodate an everincreasing choice of new or improved_prediction programs that inevitably replace existing ones we have developed vacceed to address the challenges raised here i e to provide a flexible automated process to predict worthy vaccine_candidates from large volumes of superfluous disseminated and noisy_data vacceed is the collective name for a framework of linked bioinformatics programs perl scripts r functions and linux shell scripts a previous published study provided guidance in development
