genome_analysis assessing gene level translational_control from ribosome_profiling motivation the translational landscape of diverse cellular_systems remains largely_uncharacterized a detailed understanding of the control of gene_expression at the level of messenger_rna translation is vital to elucidating a systems level view of complex molecular programs in the cell establishing the degree to which such post_transcriptional can mediate specific phenotypes is similarly critical to elucidating the molecular pathogenesis of diseases such as cancer recently methods for massively_parallel of ribosome bound fragments of messenger_rna have begun to uncover genome_wide translational_control at codon resolution despite its promise for deeply characterizing mammalian proteomes few analytical_methods exist for the comprehensive analysis of this paired rna and ribosome data results we describe the babel framework an analytical methodology for assessing the significance of changes in translational regulation within cells and between conditions this approach_facilitates the analysis of translation genome_wide while allowing statistically principled gene level inference babel is based on an errors in variables regression_model that uses the negative_binomial and draws inference using a parametric bootstrap approach we demonstrate the operating characteristics of babel on simulated_data and use its gene level inference to extend prior analyses significantly discovering new translationally regulated modules under mammalian_target mtor_pathway signaling control availability the babel framework is freely_available as source_code atthe translation of cellular messenger_rnas mrnas is the allimportant final_product of gene_expression nevertheless a complete understanding of gene_expression at the level of mrna_translation is generally lacking as mrna_levels explain only a modest fraction of protein_abundance we must establish the landscape of mrna_translation and determine the mechanisms by which it is regulated to fully elucidate diverse cellular_systems nevertheless genome_scale characterization of translational changes has lagged behind the development of similar methods for exploring mammalian transcriptomes recent_advances in profiling ribosome occupancy with deep_sequencing however now allows a near codon resolution view of ribosome bound mrnas briefly ribosome_profiling entails isolating fragments of such mrnas which results in bp ribosome protected fragments rpfs that are purified and processed for massively_parallel simultaneously and from the same cells poly a mrna is purified and concurrent sequencing of both ribosome and rna libraries generates short_sequence that identify either the position of a bound ribosome or the expression of the cognate transcript these methods have been used to explore translation in diverse genomes including those from yeast zebrafish murine_models and human_cancers these studies have revealed a complex and multifaceted translational landscape in mammalian transcriptomes although open_reading orfs that initiate with an aug codon are canonical and are perhaps best characterized a variety of noncanonical structures also contribute to the diversity and complexity of translation these include upstream orfs non aug initiation of translation internal_ribosome translational re initiation and frameshift leaky scanning and the ever expanding world of small_rnas expressed short and long non coding_sequences that lack an orf so although ribosome_profiling promises a new window into the nature and dynamics of normal and anomalous mrna_translation progress is predicated on the development of robust methodologies to facilitate statistically principled analysis prior analyses have described the global features of translational_efficiency in different systems species and upon multiple perturbations by comparing the log of scaled ribosome counts to the log of scaled mrna counts for groups of genes however it is unclear how such a measure would lead naturally to inference about the biological_significance of individual changes in genes especially in the presence of few replicates there is therefore a great need for robust_methods for drawing gene level inference on the basis of changes in translational regulation or even subtle shifts in patterns of ribosome occupancy the importance of such quantitative methods will only grow as ribosome_profiling is adopted more widely to characterize translational abnormalities that drive diverse pathologies_including human_cancers such efforts would serve to whom correspondence should be addressed as a vital companion to extensive genetic_characterization efforts already underway such as the cancer_genome http cancergenome nih gov here to facilitate such efforts we describe a statistical_framework babel for determining genes with unexpected ribosome occupancy those insufficiently explained by their intrinsic transcript_abundance within a condition and those whose ribosome association changes in magnitude or direction between conditions we demonstrate its statistical_properties through simulations and its applicability through the re analysis of ribosome_profiling data interrogating translational_control downstream of the mtor_signaling the ability to draw statistically principled inferences about translationally regulated_genes from ribosome_profiling is necessary for the discovery of specific mechanisms of and abnormalities in translational_control in diverse cellular_systems here we introduce the babel framework for performing just such an analysis babel produces a natural and readily interpretable summary p value of the level of ribosome given mrna for individual genes within samples and between conditions on simulated_data we demonstrated that babel has proper type_i both within and between conditions and possesses good power that increases with sample and effect_size emphasizing the need for careful design of ribosome_profiling experiments a reanalysis of ribosome_profiling in response to multifaceted mtor inhibition both confirmed prior_findings and importantly extended them to identify novel functional_modules subject to translational_control in prostate cancer_cells among the greatest strengths of babel is model flexibility as more is learned about the layers of overt post_transcriptional that impact ribosome occupancy and may uncouple the abundance of a transcript from its level of active translation quantitative_measures of these underlying_processes can be incorporated as covariates to improve the accuracy of the model babel also introduces a new approach for combining p values across independent_tests in this context that has applicability far beyond the analysis of ribosome_profiling nevertheless challenges remain our simulations and experience indicate that modeling rpfs for genes with low mrna_abundance and therefore low rpfs can produce inaccurate p values based on what may be small stochastic_fluctuations in read_counts between samples see supplementary note although beyond the scope of this work improving this will require a joint estimate of rpf and mrna counts sufficient to produce accurate p values from the bootstrap in the left tail of the mrna distribution furthermore additional improvements to the ribosome_profiling protocol are necessary to extend these analyses to isoformspecific translational patterns despite these challenges babel establishes a statistical_framework for inferring changes in translational regulation of cellular mrnas in conjunction with ribosome_profiling the babel framework will help bridge the gap in our understanding of the translational_control of normal and pathogenic phenotypes analysis of mtor inhibition a the relationship between babel produced q values for genes after mtor inhibition with the adenosine_triphosphate site inhibitor pp compared with the absolute value of translational_efficiency as previously calculated the rank of genes identified by babel or by the original study is shown inset ranked by babel significance b babel analysis of mtorc inhibition with pp identified several genes_encoding distinct subunits of the eif complex as selectively inhibited at the translational level a signature that was absent upon rapamycin_treatment or among the other eif complexes the eif complex bound to the s ribosome is represented schematicallywith subunits colored as a function of the significance of their translational_repression upon mtor inhibition as indicated
