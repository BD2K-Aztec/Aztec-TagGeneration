data_and r dwd distance weighted discrimination for classification visualization and batch adjustment r dwd is an extensible package for classification it is built based on a recently_developed powerful classification_method called distance weighted discrimination dwd dwd is related to and has been shown to be superior to the support_vector in situations that are fundamental to bioinformatics such as very high_dimensional dwd has proven to be very useful for several fundamental bioinformatics tasks including classification data visualization and removal of biases such as batch_effects earlier dwd implementations however relied on matlab which is not free and requires a license the major_contribution of the r dwd package is an implementation that is completely in r and thus can be used without any requirements for licensing or software purchase in addition r dwd also provides efficient solvers for second order cone programming and quadratic_programming availability_and the package is freely_available from cran rclassification plays an important role in the analysis of bioinformatics data and as a result has a significant impact on a broad array of applications the new freely_available package r dwd http cran r project org_web dwd index html provides a powerful classification_tool for analyzing high_dimensional it has been shown both through intuitive explanation and improved classification error_rates to perform better than the popular support_vector svm method in high_dimensional situations svm is a wellknown classification technique and has achieved great success in bioinformatics applications see byvatov and schmeider for a review however as shown in a svm suffers from the data piling problem which leads to suboptimal performance in high_dimension low sample_size hdlss contexts this is increasingly relevant as hdlss problems continue to become more and more common in bioinformatics contexts examples_include many types of genetic data such as microarrays next gen to whom correspondence should be addressed superior_performance of dwd over svm in a hdlss setting horizontal axis shows projections vertical axes are jitter heights and density data piling appears in svm a but not in dwd b the angles from the signal direction also indicate that dwd performs better than svm sequencing and many more medical image_analysis and chemometrics hdlss data pose a great challenge to many classical statistical multivariate_analysis methods distance weighted discrimination dwd is a recently_developed classification_method which was originally motivated by hdlss problems but can be applied in many other cases as well one of the big advantages of dwd over svm is that it can overcome the data piling problem in high_dimensional situations as illustrated in more discussion about data piling can be found in the supplementary_material which also includes the classification_performance of dwd in comparison with svm for various real_data a simulated toy example is given inwith dimension d n data vectors from class black plus signs and n data vectors from class grey circles the data were drawn from two distributions that are each standard normal but the mean in the first dimension is shifted to for class the horizontal coordinates represent the projection of the data_points onto the svm and dwd directions to avoid overplotting of the data_points we use tukeys jitter plot approach where one adds a random vertical component to each point also included is a smooth histogram for each class where the vertical_axis shows density per unit length the plot inshows clear piling up of the datathe main purposes of r dwd are classification data adjustment and visualization which are all very important in bioinformatics fields a variety of additional features are planned for future r dwd releases only the linear discrimination method is considered in the current version future plans include incorporating some kernel tricks into the dwd method such that it can be used to solve more general non linear problems
