inductive matrix completion for predicting gene_disease motivation most existing_methods for predicting causal disease genes rely on specific type of evidence and are therefore limited in terms of applicability more often than not the type of evidence available for diseases variesfor example we may know linked_genes keywords associated with the disease obtained by mining text or co occurrence of disease symptoms in patients similarly the type of evidence available for genes variesfor example specific micro array probes convey_information only for certain sets of genes in this article we apply a novel matrix completion method called inductive matrix completion to the problem of predicting gene_disease it combines multiple types of evidence features for diseases and genes to learn latent_factors that explain the observed genedis ease associations we construct features from different biological_sources such as microarray_expression and disease related text ual data a crucial advantage of the method is that it is inductive it can be applied to diseases not seen at training time unlike traditional matrix completion approaches and network_based methods that are transductive results comparison with state of the art methods on diseases from the online_mendelian omim database shows that the proposed approach is substantially betterit has close to one in four chance of recovering a true association in the top predictions compared to the recently_proposed catapult method second best that has chance we demonstrate that the inductive method is particularly effective for a query disease with no previously known gene_associations and for predicting novel genes i e genes that are previously not linked to diseases thus the method is capable of predicting novel genes even for well characterized diseases we also validate the novelty of predictions by evaluating the method on recently reported omim associations and on associations recently reported in the literature availability source_code and datasets can be downloaded fromin silico prioritization of disease genes is an important step towards discovering causal_genes and understanding genetic_disorders many diseasegene prioritization_tools have been developed in the last decade some generic and some disease class specific due to the inherent difficulty and latency in human genedisease studies very few reliable associations are reported to public_databases such as the online_mendelian omim and the genetic_association database therefore exploiting multiple auxiliary sources of data is essential for predicting genes related to polygenic traits and many existing_methods have been developed for this purpose for example a popular family of network based_methods include cipher genewalker k ohler et_al prince rwrh and catapult these methods exploit biological_networks such as the functional gene interactions network and disease similarity network they infer genedisease connections by using random_walk procedures on different biological_networks or computing a similarity measure between nodes the problem of predicting genedisease_associations can be thought of as analogous to designing a recommender system where the goal is to predict the preference that a user gene would give to an item disease an important formulation used in recommender systems such as the netflix movie recommendations is matrix completion where the problem is to complete the user item preference matrix given a sample of observed preferences the standard matrix completion techniques for recovering the user item preference matrix assume that the true underlying matrix is low_rank to the best of our knowledge there is no existing successful application of the matrix completion approach to recovering the genedisease_associations matrix two reasons are the extreme sparsity of the associations matrix and the lack of negative_associations also all matrix completion approaches suffer from the cold start problem that of making predictions for a new user see section our approach in this article is based on matrix completion and is best motivated by the limitations of the existing_methods discussed next most of the aforementioned methods typically rely on a seed or candidate set of genes already linked to the query disease and therefore fail to make predictions for a new disease of interest for which there are no gene linkage_studies yet a few make reasonable predictions if we could compute some similarity measure with existing diseases on which the methods were trained however more often than not the type of evidence available for diseases of interest variesfor example we may know already linked_genes keywords associated with the disease obtained by mining text or co occurrence of disease symptoms in patients methods relying on a specific type of evidence such as disease similarities cannot be applied to a query disease with a different type of evidence say keywords associated with the disease the same is true for the type of evidence available for genes network based_methods cannot predict a gene that is not connected to any other node in the network on

evidence be merged to provide better coverage and generalization than any single data source the survey article by piro and di cunto discusses the following different types of evidence used by prioritization_tools text_mining of biomedical_literature functional_annotations pathways and ontologies phenotype relationships intrinsic gene properties sequence_data protein_protein regulatory information orthologous relationships and gene_expression information in this article we propose a framework that can seamlessly integrate features from the aforementioned data_sources our approach involves two steps first we derive features for diseases and genes from multiple sources next we incorporate the features while trying to learn genedisease_associations in a novel inductive matrix completion imc approach recently_developed and theoretically analyzed by jain and the entries of the associations matrix are assumed to be generated by applying the corresponding gene and disease feature_vectors on an unknown low_rank matrix z the parameter matrix z is learnt using a training_set of omim genedisease_associations and predictions for a disease are obtained as a function of the features of all genes and the feature_vector for the disease we evaluate our proposed approach through comprehensive experiments and demonstrate substantial increase in the quality of predictions compared to state of the art methods our findings and contributions are summarized below integrating diverse feature_sets of genes and diseases obtained through a wealth of publicly_available data overcomes extreme sparsity in the genedisease_associations data our approach is a novel application of the inductive matrix completion method it can be applied to diseases not seen at training time unlike traditional matrix completion approaches and other network_based methods that are transductive the approach is particularly effective for a query disease with no previously known gene_associations and for predicting novel genes i e genes that are previously not linked to diseases thus capable of making novel predictions even for well characterized diseases comparison with state of the art methods on omim diseases shows the superiority of the inductive method we also validate the novelty of predictions by evaluating the method on recently_discovered gene_associations recorded in the omim database as well as on associations recently reported in the literature curated by b ornigen et_al we begin by discussing the limitations of traditional matrix completion techniques motivating our approach and describing the inductive method in section in section we describe our experimental_datasets and construction of gene and disease features extensive quantitative analysis of the new approach is presented in section and conclusions are presented in section
