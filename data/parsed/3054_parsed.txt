gene_expression modelling time course gene_expression data with finite mixtures of linear additive models a model class of finite mixtures of linear additive models is presented the component specific parameters in the regression_models are estimated using regularized likelihood methods the advantages of the regularization are that i the pre specified maximum degrees_of for the splines is less crucial than for unregularized estimation and that ii for each component individually a suitable degree of freedom is selected in an automatic way the performance is evaluated in a simulation_study with artificial data as well as on a yeast_cell dataset of gene_expression levels over time availability the latest release version of the r package flexmix is available from cran http cran r project org time course microarray_experiments make it possible to look at the gene_expression of thousands of genes at several time points simultaneously clustering of gene_expression is in general used to identify common temporal or spatial expression_patterns cluster results contribute to the regulatory_network of gene_expression i e suggest functional pathways and interaction between genes in the literature numerous methods for clustering time course gene_expression data have been proposed besides traditional_methods like hierarchical_clustering or the classical k means algorithm modelbased clustering is frequently used model_based has the advantage to provide a framework to determine the number of clusters and the role of each variable in the clustering process e g suitable models for time course gene_expression data need to be able to i distinguish between groups with different expression_patterns and to ii determine smooth curves for the development over time finite mixtures of regression_models e g of linear_models lms or of linear_mixed with splines as covariates were proposed for this purpose the use of splines to determine the covariate matrices has the advantage that the functional relationship to whom correspondence should be addressed between the dependent and independent_variables does not need to be specified a priori and arbitrary smooth functions can be fit the disadvantage is that the flexibility of the covariate space needs to be fixed before model estimation i e needs to be assumed to be known if the covariate space is determined in a data_driven way different mixture_models where the flexibility of the spline functions is varied need to be compared using model_selection techniques even when imposing the restriction that the same degree of flexibility applies to all components a considerable number of different models needs to be estimated and compared whilediscuss model_selection with respect to the number of components and recommend the bayesian_information bic for this purpose they do not address the issue of selecting appropriate degrees_of for the splines in their applications only models with an a priori fixed number of degrees_of are fitted and compared linear additive models lams model the dependent_variable as a sum of smooth functions of the covariates these smooth functions can either be nonparametric local smoothers or also spline functions in the case of spline functions in general penalized_regression splines are used and the degree of flexibility for the smooth functions is determined by choosing an appropriate smoothing parameter the smoothing parameter can either be selected using generalized cross_validation gcv or restricted_maximum re ml in the latter case the smoothing parameter is determined using the maximal marginal restricted likelihood integrated over the penalized coefficients which after re parameterization are assumed to follow a normal distribution with mean zero and variance indirectly proportional to the smoothing parameter lams with regularized estimation therefore allow to estimate the degree of flexibility in a data_driven way this ensures that a suitable and parsimonious model is selected the exact maximum flexibility i e the degrees_of of the splines allowed is less important and the different models arising from changing this hyperparameter can be compared on a coarser grid reducing the number of models evaluated in the model selection_step in section the model is specified and methods for estimation and inference in a ml framework are discussed section evaluates the performance of the mixtures of lams with regularized estimation using artificial data which resembles time course gene_expression the number of noise genes as well as the variation within components are varied to assess the influence of these data characteristics on the performance an application to the yeast cellpage
