genome_analysis discovering homotypic binding_events at high_spatial motivation clusters of proteindna_interaction events_involving the same transcription_factor are known to act as key components of invertebrate and mammalian promoters and enhancers however detecting closely_spaced homotypic events from chip_seq is challenging because random variation in the chip fragmentation process obscures event locations results the genome positioning system gps can predict protein_dna events at high_spatial from chip_seq while retaining the ability to resolve closely_spaced events that appear as a single cluster of reads gps models observed reads using a complexity penalized mixture_model and efficiently predicts event locations with a segmented em_algorithm an optional mode permits gps to align common events across distinct experiments gps detects more joint events in synthetic and actual chip_seq and has superior spatial_resolution when compared with other methods in addition the specificity and sensitivity of gps are superior to or comparable with other methods availability http cgs the precise physical description of where transcription_factors histones rna_polymerase and other proteins interact with the genome provides an invaluable mechanistic foundation for understanding gene_regulation chip_seq chromatin_immunoprecipitation followed by high_throughput has become an indispensable tool for genome_wide of protein_dna computational_methods are necessary to predict the location of proteindna_interaction events from chip_seq because random variation in the chip dna_fragmentation process obscures the actual location of interaction events thus while chip_seq dna_sequence are mapped to precise bases in the genome these reads do not manifestly indicate the location of the proteindna to whom correspondence should be addressed interaction events that caused them we define spatial_resolution to be the difference between the computationally predicted location of a proteindna binding event and the midpoint of its actual location an ideal computational_method for analyzing chip_seq would accurately localize protein_dna events high_spatial would include no false events high_specificity would include all true events high_sensitivity and would be able to resolve closely_spaced dna_protein joint event discovery joint event discovery is important because it can capture cooperative biological regulatory_mechanisms in proximal genomic_locations homotypic clusters of transcription_factor tfbs have been extensively_studied in drosophila such regulatory_mechanisms may be common in mammalian_genomes as of certain chip_seq defined protein_dna regions contain more than one motif within bp furthermore homotypic clusters of tfbs occupy nearly of the human_genome and may act as key components of almost half of the human promoters and enhancers thus homotypic event discovery is necessary to fully reveal the transcription_factor regulatory_interactions present in chip_seq existing chip_seq computational_methods do not simultaneously consider multiple events as the cause for observed reads in the context of a probabilistic_model at mammalian genome_scale to detect binding_events peakseq extends the length of mapped_reads to create peaks macs shifts the mapped position of reads a fixed distance towards their ends findpeaks aggregates overlapping reads sissrs identifies positive to negative strand transition_points at read accumulations cisgenome scans for the center of modes of the and peaks and quest and spp use kernel_density methods all of these methods use statistical detection criteria such as overlapping read_counts or read_distribution strand symmetry to estimate the location of a proteindna_interaction event a recent method_named csdeconv deconvolves proximal binding_events using a computed spatial read_distribution although it is at present computationally impractical on entire mammalian_genomes in addition recent evaluations showed that while all these methods identified binding_sites with a highly significant_overlap with the corresponding sequence_motif and exhibited similar sensitivity_and there are pronounced differences in their spatial_resolution page gps is a novel computational_method that uses a probabilistic mixture_model to predict the most likely positions of binding_events at single_base based on a characteristic spatial distribution of reads our analysis with synthetic and actual chip_seq demonstrates the value of our approach in resolving closely_spaced joint events and improving event spatial_resolution gpss ability to resolve homotypic events from chip_seq will facilitate the genome_wide study of cooperative_binding on gene_expression under specific biological conditions homotypic binding_sites have been shown to act as key components of invertebrate and mammalian promoters and enhancers in addition modeling based_approaches have demonstrated that identifying homotypic binding is important for the faithful reproduction of biological_behaviors gps also provides improved spatial_resolution specificity and sensitivity when compared with contemporary methods the high_spatial of gps can be used to produce a positionspecific prior that can be used by motif_discovery methods to limit motif search to tight genomic_regions around events supplementary notes supplementary or can exclude event locations for co factor motif_discovery in addition we expect that alternative empirical read distributions can be used for different kinds of events such as histone location as the gps framework is inherently adaptable to other empirical read distributions
