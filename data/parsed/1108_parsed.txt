computational_identification of pirna targets on mouse mrnas motivation piwi_interacting pirnas are a class of small_non that are highly abundant in the germline one important role of pirnas is to defend genome_integrity by guiding piwi proteins to silence transposable_elements tes which have a high potential to cause deleteri ous effects on their host the mechanism of pirna mediated post transcriptional_silencing was also observed to affect mrnas suggesting that pirnas might play a broad role in gene_expression regulation however there has been no systematic report with regard to how many protein_coding might be targeted and regulated by pirnas results we trained a support_vector classifier based on a combination of miwi clip_seq derived features and position derived features to predict the potential targets of pirnas on mrnas in the mouse reanalysis of a published microarray_dataset suggested that the expression_level of the protein_coding predicted as pirna targets showed significant upregulation as a whole after abolishing the slicer activity of miwi supporting the conclusion that they are subject to pirna mediated regulation availability_and a web version of the method called pirnapre as well as our results for browse is available atpiwi interacting rnas pirnas micrornas mirnas and short_interfering sirnas are three major classes of small_rnas pirnas differ from mirnas and sirnas in several aspects pirnas show specific expression in germ_cells most pirnas have lengths in the range of nt sai greater than those of mirnas and sirnas which are nt in most cases although caenorhabditis_elegans pirnas with the unusual length of nt constitute an exception to the general rule pirnas do not show any conservation in either sequence or secondary_structure le except that there is a preference for a uridine u residue and an adenosine as the tenth nucleotide pirnas bind to piwi clade argonauts whereas mirnas and sirnas associate with the ago clade argonauts and most pirnas are derived from genomic pirna clusters which are discrete regions containing a large number of various types of transposable_elements tes besides pirnas have distinguished biogenesis mechanisms which are independent of dicer the recently reported phased manner of pirna biogenesis further supports thatpirnas are more diverse than other classes of small_rnas the existence of pirnas represents adaptive control mechanisms that protect the genomic architecture against tes which constitute a large fraction of the mammalian_genome and are a constant threat to the host piwi proteins participate in the pirna pathway le the mutation of miwi in the mouse results in male_infertility and the upregulation of line retrotransposon transcripts there have been similar observations made in flies when mutations in piwi aub or ago occurred the silencing machinery is similar to that of sirnas and mirnas a pirna recognizes a transposon transcript target by complementarity and the interacting piwi protein then slices via its catalytic_domain cleaving the target at a position nt downstream of the end of the pirna generating a monophosphate containing fragment recent_studies pirna mediated_cleavage acts not only on tes but also on mrnas in silkworm even discovered that a single pirna is responsible for primary sex_determination by mediating cleavage of the masc mrna demonstrating the functional_importance of pirna mediated_cleavage on mrna our previous study revealed widespread miwi pirna mediated mrna cleavage events in mouse testes and demonstrated the functional_importance of the temporal cleavage of pirna target_mrnas for spermiogenesis taking_advantage of published global race rapid amplification of complementary_dna ends tags we previously_identified pirna targeted mrnas the role of pirnas in mediating mrna cleavage is also evidenced in c elegans and d melanogaster however there has been no systematic_assessment with respect to how many protein_coding might be regulated by a pirna guided cleavage mechanism in this study we trained a support_vector svm classifier to predict potential pirna targets on protein_coding because base_pairing recognition by pirnas as well as the physical association of miwi are both critical for pirna guided cleavage in mouse male_germ the anti miwi crosslinking immunoprecipitation coupled with deep_sequencing clip_seq data that we produced recently was used to obtain both pirnas and target fragments in particular we introduced a combination of clip seqderived features and position derived features in contrast to the previous identification of pirna targets from race tags which is restricted to the sequencing_depth we have undertaken a genomewide scan across all sites of mrna_transcripts and computationally identified mrnas of protein_coding as potential pirna targets this result was further validated by a microarray_dataset that presented gene_expression differences between catalytic mutant without miwi slicer activity and the wild_type the dataset of pirna targets in mrnas is available for browsing searching and download via http www regulatoryrna org software pirna pirna target_mrna index php using the pirna targets that we previously_identified as positive examples of our training_dataset we madecomputational identification of pirna targetsgenome wide de_novo predictions and provided a much larger list of mrnas that might be targeted and cleaved by pirnas in this study we took advantage of clip_seq data which are specific to fragments that are bound by the miwi protein whereas the previous study was based on race sequencing_data which contains not only fragments that are produced by pirna mediated_cleavage but also other biological_processes moreover the previous study was restricted to the coverage of race sequencing_data on mrnas whereas the depth of the clip_seq data that were used in this study makes it possible to systematic explore pirna targets on mrnas in addition the incorporation of position derived features enabled the discovery of pirna target_sites that might be missed by the absence of complementary pirnas from sequenced_reads our method presents robustness as repeated random_selection of negative_examples for training the model did not resulted in much difference with regarding to the predicted list of pirna target_genes it could also be applied to other tissue_types which have both training examples and anti miwi clip_seq data in addition to the repression of mrnas by cleavage in this study another repression mechanism is mediated by pirnas that induces mrna deadenylation resulting in mrna_degradation for example pirnas target the nanos utr with imperfect complementarity thus facilitating nanos mrna deadenylation and normal anteroposterior embryonic patterning in drosophila recently reported that more than mrnas were associated with miwi of which approximately experienced destabilization by miwi in the elongating_spermatids of mouse together with mrnas that are involved in pirna mediated_cleavage a catalog of nearly ten thousand protein_coding are potentially mediated by pirnas suggesting a prosperous role of pirnas in gene_expression regulation conclusively pirnas have mechanisms that act to repress protein_coding gene_expression similar to mirnas either causing the cleavage of the target or the degradation of the target both the mirna_pathway and the pirna pathway require recognition based on base_pairing and the participation of proteins from the argonaute protein_family however because pirnas are restricted to expression in germ_cells pirnamediated regulation might take place primarily during spermatogenesis it has been well accepted for a long period of time that the emergence of pirnas plays a role in genome defense by silencing tes however many recent_studies that pirna guided silencing mechanisms are also involved in the regulation of nontransposon transcripts the first example of a pirna targeting mrna was described in the drosophila embryo a similar phenomenon was also observed in c elegans mouse and silkworm suggesting that pirnas could regulate_gene via a mechanism similar to that of mirnas although there have been many published programs aimed at predicting mirna_targets as well as public_databases curating experimentally_verified or computational predicted targets of mirnas there have been no studies assessing how many proteincoding_genes might be regulated by pirnas in our study pirna targets on mrnas were systematically identified at the genomewide level using an svm classifier the classifier was trained based on the incorporation of miwi clip_seq derived features and position derived features and achieved an area of the roc_curve of at the site level and at the gene level of all of the features that were used miwi clip_seq derived features play a dominate role in the pirna enrichment of the end nt downstream of the target_site occupying the top_ranked position of the position derived features the genomic annotation is highly ranked with utr as a preferred choice and nucleotide usage on the first and tenth positions downstream of the target_site is the next highest ranked genome_wide prediction based on the trained classifier resulted in mrnas of protein_coding as pirna targets these genes show significant upregulation as a whole after the slicer activity of miwi was abolished suggesting that the predicted list of pirna targets is reliable this work might provide valuable clues for biologists who are interested in the function of pirnas in protein_coding more details of the prediction results in this study and the online version of the method called pirnapre are available at
