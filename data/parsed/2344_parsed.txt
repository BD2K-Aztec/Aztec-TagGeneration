structural_bioinformatics ifuse integrated fusion_gene explorer we present ifuse integrated fusion_gene explorer an online visualization_tool that provides a fast and informative view of structural_variation data and prioritizes those breaks likely representing fusion_genes this application uses calculated break_points to determine fusion_genes based on the latest annotation for genomic sequence_information and where relevant the structural_variation sv events are annotated with predicted rna and protein_sequences ifuse takes as input a complete genomics cg junction file a fusionmap fusion_detection report file or a file already analysed and annotated by the ifuse application on a previous occasion results we demonstrate the use of ifuse with case studies from tumour normal sv_detection derived from complete genomics whole_genome results availability ifuse is available as a web_service atstructural variation analysis is a common requirement in the study of cancer where many fusion_genes have been implicated in the progression of cancer the use of next_generation for fusion_gene detection in cancer structural_variation in non cancerous diseases and in normal genomes the genomes_project consortium has expanded knowledge of the importance of these events in a recent study the use of de_novo in association with sv_detection suggests that svs account for more diversity between individuals than do single_nucleotide complete genomics uses de_novo during sv single nucleotide variation and copy_number determination traditionally for a given sv a user can visualize the individual sides of the breaks in viewers such as igv but not the resulting event or fusion_gene as a whole and must manually retrieve the sequence of the resulting event based on the exons from both genes of the proposed fusion_gene and determine the orientation and frame of the predicted transcript and encoded polypeptide sequences other applications also offer visualization but with the caveat that the user must process their data within the application e g ingap sv or that a bioinformatician is required to render the visualization using e g circos our aim is to deliver a web_based application that allows scientists to visualize all detected sv events and fusion_genes determined in their results and to provide the concomitant candidate transcripts and polypeptide sequences associated with the detected fusion_genes no other application exists at the moment to categorize and visualize the candidate fusion_genes and to determine the proposed sequence for gdna rna and polypeptides from standard sv files two public cancer_genomes have been used to demonstrate the use of ifuse for the prediction of fusion_genes genomes were downloaded from complete genomics ftp completegenomics com the results can be found in an event is labelled as a fusion_gene if the break_point has two different genes on either side if the two sides also have the same orientation are on the same strand or in the case of an inversion on opposite strands and are also in frame the event is called a fusion_protein
