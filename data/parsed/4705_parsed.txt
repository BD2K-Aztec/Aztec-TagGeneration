genome_analysis toward community standards in the quest for orthologs the identification of orthologsgenes pairs descended from a common_ancestor through speciation rather than duplication has emerged as an essential component of many bioinformatics applications ranging from the annotation of new genomes to experimental target prioritization yet the development and application of orthology inference methods is hampered by the lack of consensus on source proteomes file_formats and benchmarks the second quest for orthologs meeting brought together stakeholders from various communities to address these challenges we report on achievements and outcomes of this meeting focusing on topics of particular relevance to the research_community at large the quest for orthologs consortium is an open community that welcomes contributions from all researchers interested in orthology research and applications contact the concepts of orthology and paralogy are central to comparative_genomics these terms were coined more than four decades_ago to distinguish between two classes of gene homology those descended from a common_ancestor by virtue of a speciation event orthologs versus those that diverged by gene_duplication paralogs this distinction permits accurate description of the complex evolutionary_relationships within gene_families including members distributed across multiple species detection of orthology and paralogy has become an essential component of diverse applications including the reconstruction of evolutionary_relationships across species reviewed in inference of functional gene properties e g and identification and testing of proposed_mechanisms of genome_evolution e g in todays context with the number of fully sequenced_genomes growing by the day accurate and efficient inference of orthology has become an imperative a plethora of computational_methods have been developed for inferring orthologous relationships many of which provide their predictions in form of web accessible databases reviewed in in the first quest for orthologs meeting was organized to bring together scientists working in the fields of orthology inference genome_annotation and genome_evolution to exchange ideas tackle common challenges aiming at removing barriers and redundancy the main objectives identified were concerted_effort toward standardized formats datasets and benchmarks and establishment of continuous communication channels including a mailing list a website and a regular meeting following the first quest for ortholog meeting in a second meeting was held in june bringing together participants from different institutions on continents representing orthology databases http questfororthologs org orthology databases the meeting was structured to include plenary sessions devoted to topics of general interest reference datasets orthology detection methodology practical_applications of orthology and additional discussions focusing on benchmarking standardized formats alternative transcripts ncrna orthology etc in this letter we summarize the discussions and specific outcomes of the meeting as well as some of the most important achievements of the quest for orthologs community in the past_years
