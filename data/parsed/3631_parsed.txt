genome_analysis prap an ab_initio software_package for automated genome_wide analysis of dna_repeats for prokaryotes motivation prokaryotic genome_annotation has been focused mainly on identifying all genes and their protein functions however of the prokaryotic_genomes submitted to genbank contain partial repeat features of specific types and none of the genomes contain complete repeat annotations deciphering all repeats in dna_sequences is an important and open task in genome_annotation and bioinformatics hence there is an immediate need of a tool capable of identifying full spectrum repeats in the whole_genome results we report the prap prokaryotic repeats annotation program software_package to automate the analysis of repeats in both finished and draft_genomes it is aimed at identifying full spectrum repeats at the scale of the prokaryotic_genome compared with the major existing repeat finding tools prap exhibits competitive or better results the results are consistent with manually_curated and experimental_data repeats can be identified and grouped into families to define their relevant types the final output is parsed into the european molecular_biology laboratory embl genbank feature table format for reading and displaying in artemis where it can be combined or compared with other genome data it is currently the most complete repeat finder for prokaryotes and is a valuable_tool for genome_annotation advancements in sequencing_technology have led to a rapid increase in genomes sequenced and a raised demand for accurate and complete genome_annotation it is highly_desirable to have an adequate genome_annotation software capable of performing essential tasks such as predicting correct genes and repetitive_sequences all organisms have in the total dna of a cell multicopies of similar sequences i e the repeats hence repeat identification and masking have been considered as an essential phase of the sequence_assembly and annotation for the eukaryotic_genomes but not in prokaryotes for many years repetitive_sequences in prokaryotic_genomes have been studied in individual cases research now indicates that prokaryotic repeats have an important role as is currently understood for eukaryotes repeats in prokaryotes include i local repeats such as lowcomplexity repeats simple repeats and tandem_repeats ii repeats in genes that are duplicated or functionally_related such as duplicated_genes protein_domains and rrna_operons iii mobile repeats that play_an in genome plasticity and evolution such as insertion_sequences is and transposons and iv interspersed or intergenic repeats that may provide the regulatory or structural_variations of chromosomes to adapt to environmental_challenges such as clustered_regularly crisprs however in many completed prokaryotic genome_annotations reported to genbank repeat features have been completely_absent merely search ncbi nucleotide database with command bacteria archaea organism and complete genome title and not plasmid title not vector title w o and repeat region of the organisms contain partial repeat features and none contains complete repeat annotations this is likely due to the following reasons i the repeat functions have been underestimated ii there are no repeat libraries available for the prokaryotic_genomes in the repeatmasker database which is currently the most widely used repeat finder software iii based on the assumption that all open_reading are candidates of prokaryotic genes gene prediction and analyses have been performed on prokaryotic_genomes without obtaining repetitive_dna information which is indispensable to eukaryotic genome_annotation and iv the last and most important_reason is that currently there is no suitable tool for the automated annotation of full spectrum repeats in the whole prokaryote genome a number of computing algorithms have been developed either for finding all repeat classes such as recon parsimonious inference of a library of elementary repeats piler windowmasker repeatscout and repeatfinder with reputer or only for a specific pattern such as crispr recognition tool crt crisprfinder and tandem_repeats analysis program trap in the genome these tools were designed to find either repeats directly or repeat families that led to the building of the repeat library used by repeatmasker whose purpose is to manage masking and identifying repeats to whom correspondence should be addressed each algorithm has its specific advantages_and in finding repeats among them recon used a self aligned sequence_read as a starting seed to find the groups of elements which were then clustered into families it has worked well for shotgun sequences or a relatively short assembled sequence in the order of mb recon is capable of identifying more potentially novel repeats than the peer tools thus it was adopted in our study as the repeat library builder to develop the prap megablast uses the greedy_algorithm to search similar sequences and was thus chosen to perform the self search allagainst all in the first step of repeat identification in this article we report this fast and accurate automated method that is aimed to identify all families of repeats at a genomic_scale we believe that this is currently the most complete repeat identification tool designed for prokaryotic_genomes we described an ab_initio system for rapid identification of all spectrum repeats in prokaryotic genome_sequences and the assignment of these repeats to families prokaryotic_genome at the scale of mb allows blast to use a smaller_size of search word to identify both short and long repeat segments accurately the nature of the repeats within the prokaryotic_genomes facilitates the algorithm to minimize errors generated from grouping the repeat family thus achieving better performance to run prap it is required to download and install blast recon viscose repeatmasker and artemis from different external sources downloading installing and granting the licensee permission are users responsibility although these prerequisites do not update frequently adjustment of the executing commands of the software might be required when using a different version for initiating installation or updating false_positive is a common index of specificity to assess the performance of discovery algorithms however by definition a dna repeat is two similar sequences and the precise_definition of a false_positive is debatable moreover unlike eukaryotes which have extensive curated known repeatmasker libraries repbase to aid in identifying true_positive repeats prokaryotes have difficulty in evaluating the tools in terms of sensitivity_and therefore we used the direct comparison of repeat numbers boundary approach instead of the sensitivity_and of repeat as benchmarks for comparing the code performance prap currently categorizes the repeats as transposon protein motif repeat rna crisprs and unknown however it is challenging to clearly distinguish repeat families especially when overlap and mosaic subrepeat structure occur as stated in section repeat elements may be categorized into different families owing to embedding in a longer repeat belonging to the different family furthermore prap tends to distinguish the less conserved repeats from a conserved group into different families and it may require some adjustment using the similarity cutoff setting mobile repeats are often nested in one another in the form of fragments which become a major source of fragmented transposons hence fragmented transposons as opposed to intactnote all hits similarity were removed the value in difference columns indicates the number of difference in blast hits and recon repeat families between the single and the merged runs the number in parentheses is the percentage
