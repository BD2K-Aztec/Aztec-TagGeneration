identification of a small set of plasma signalling proteins using neural_network for prediction of alzheimer's_disease motivation alzheimers_disease ad is a dementia that gets worse with time resulting in loss of memory and cognitive_functions the life_expectancy of ad patients following diagnosis is years in researchers estimated that of the world_population range was afflicted by ad and that the prevalence rate would be tripled by usually examination of brain_tissues is required for definite_diagnosis of ad so it is crucial to diagnose ad at an early_stage via some alternative_methods as the brain controls many functions via releasing signalling proteins through blood we analyse blood_plasma proteins for diagnosis of ad results here we use a radial_basis rbf network for feature_selection called feature_selection rbf network for selection of plasma proteins that can help diagnosis of ad we have identified a set of plasma proteins smaller in size than previous study with comparable prediction_accuracy we have also analysed mild_cognitive mci samples with our selected proteins we have used neural_networks and support_vector as classifiers the principle_component sammmon projection and heat map of the selected proteins have been used to demonstrate the proteins discriminating_power for diagnosis of ad we have also found a set of plasma signalling proteins that can distinguish incipient ad from mci at an early_stage literature_survey strongly supports the ad diagnosis capability of the selected plasma proteins alzheimers_disease ad is the most common form of dementia according to a cohort longitudinal_study persons per persons per year get dementia of which get ad in ad an unknown process divides amyloid_precursor into smaller fragments one of these fragments gives rise to fibrils of beta_amyloid which gets deposited outside neurons in dense formation known as senile_plaques tau_protein becomes hyper phosphorylated and creates neurofibrillary_tangles in recent_years researchers have devoted great efforts for the development of ad diagnosis tools most of the articles have investigated on a small set two to four of cerebro_spinal csf proteins few attempts have been made using serum proteins and using both csf and serum proteins some have tried tofind biomarker proteins that can discriminate ad and non ad patients and some have tried to predict ad from mild_cognitive mci patients in the study by a semi_supervised distance_metric learning using random_forests with label propagation is proposed for prediction of ad in concentration of t tau p tau and ab in csf are reported to be associated with future development of ad in patients with mci have proposed a microarray_based method that has selected blood_plasma signalling proteins to classify and predict clinical ad diagnosis we have used the same dataset and found nine plasma signalling proteins for the same problem with comparable prediction_accuracy we have also found a set of useful plasma signalling proteins that can predict ad from mci with a better prediction_accuracy the selection of biomarker plasma proteins from a large set of proteins is a feature_selection problem feature_selection can be broadly classified as filter methods and wrapper methods in filter methods the features are given importance solely depending on the properties of the features themselves these methods ignore the tool finally used to recognize the patterns but the utility of a feature depends on the pattern_recognition tool being used and the problem being solved a set of features good for a particular pattern_recognition problem and a tool may not be as good for a different pattern_recognition tool the wrapper based feature_selection utilize the classifier itself to find the relevance of the feature thus wrapper methods are generally considered better as compared with filter methods one of the early filter methods is relief in relief given a feature_vector two more instances of feature_vectors are considered one from the same class and the other from the other class the weight of a feature is decreased if the value of that feature differs more from the value in the instance of the same class than the value in the instance of the different class and vice_versa relief was modified into relieff by kernelpls is a kernel_based multivariate feature_selection method that selects features taking_into possible non linear relation between features as well as that between features and target in the study by a partial least square pls algorithm finds a low_dimensional approximation of the input matrix that can explain as close as possible the target vectors the support_vector recursive_feature svmrfe method eliminates poor features using an iterative process it starts with all features and removes one feature at a time based on a feature ranking score that is computed using the coefficients of the weight vector of a linear svm at each iteration the feature with the smallest ranking score is eliminated in this study neural_networks nns are used for feature_selection as well as for classification we have used both multilayer_perceptron mlp and radial_basis rbf nns for classification rbf nns are used for feature_selection in the studies by basak and mitra and chakraborty and pal the group feature_selection rbf gfsrbf is proposed byfor selecting useful groups of features where each feature group corresponds to a sensor in this network has been adapted for feature_selection with controlled redundancy here we have adapted gfsrbf for feature_selection without any explicit control on redundancy for selection of plasma proteins that can predict clinical ad our approach is described in the following section
