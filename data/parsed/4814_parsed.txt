using combined evidence from replicates to evaluate chip_seq motivation chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip_seq detects genome_wide dnaprotein interactions and chromatin_modifications returning enriched regions ers usually associated with a significance score moderately significant interactions can correspond to true weak interactions or to false_positives replicates of a chip_seq experiment can provide co localised evidence to decide between the two cases we designed a general methodological framework to rigorously combine the evidence of ers in chip_seq replicates with the option to set a significance threshold on the repeated evidence and a minimum number of samples bearing this evidence results we applied our method to myc transcription_factor chip_seq in k cells available in the encode_project using replicates we could extend up to times the er number with respect to single sample analysis with equivalent significance threshold we validated the rescued ers by checking for the overlap with open_chromatin and for the enrichment of the motif that myc binds with strongest affinity we compared our results with alternative_methods idr and jmosaics obtaining more validated peaks than the former and less peaks than latter but with a better validation availability_and an implementation of the proposed method and its source_code under gplv_license are freely_available atchromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next_generation chip_seq is the most commonly used method to study genome_wide chromatin_modifications or proteindna_interactions computational_tools like macs or zinba are applied on aligned chip_seq reads to detect enriched regions ers over the genome often called peaks where the local accumulation of sequencing fragments exceeds that of a background distribution typically estimated from randomly fragmented chromatin or by performing the chip_seq protocol with a control antibody as the protocol is subjected to multiple sources of noise some low_intensity accumulation of reads is possible even in absence of a true interaction with the target these low_intensity peaks which are usually present in large_amounts contain therefore a mixture of false_positives and true although weak interactions they are typically discarded when stringent thresholds on the peak call are used this approach leads to the discovery of the strongest interactions only and might distort the genome_wide picture of the genomic_locations of the transcription_factor or histone_modifications of interest given the intrinsic noise of the chip_seq protocol it is good practice to repeat every experiment at least twice as the guidelines of the encode_project indicate the information contained in replicates can then be used to assess the validity of the peaks obtained from a single sample especially of those with low_intensity in this paper we propose a novel method to rigorously combine the results of peak calls in chip_seq replicates and to obtain new sample specific peak lists taking_into their combined evidence our method_takes as input for each replicate a list of enriched genomic_regions and a measure of their individual significance in terms of a p value starting from a permissive call we divide the initial ers in stringent highly_significant and weak moderately significant and we assess the presence of overlapping enriched regions across multiple replicates non overlapping regions can be penalised or discarded according to specific needs the significance of the overlapping regions is rigorously combined with the fishers method to obtain a global_score finally this score is assessed against an adjustable threshold on the combined evidence and peaks in each replicate are either confirmed or discarded a schematic view of our method is given inand a visualisation of the results of the method on data from the encode_project is shown in in other words we are able to rescue weak peaks which would probably be discarded in a singlesample analysis when their combined evidence across multiple samples is sufficiently strong we applied our method to encode datasets from chip_seq of the myc transcription_factor in k human cells for which multiple samples with replicates are available as myc preferentially_binds to a well defined motif the choice of this tf allowed us to validate our results through motif analysis and dnase_seq data finally we compared our findings with other state of art methods the strong aspects of our method besides the validity and relevance of the results that it provides are its simplicity and flexibility together with its efficiency few minutes for replicates with a few tens_of of peaks each in this section we report the results obtained by applying our method on either technical or biological chip_seq replicates the method_takes as input the genomic_coordinates and a measure of significance i e the p value of each of the ers for each replicate considered for each input sample j it outputs the lists of confirmed r j o and discarded r j d ers as well as the lists of stringent confirmed r s c weak confirmed r w c stringent discarded r s d and weak discarded r w d ers adjustable_parameters of the method are t s maximum p value to consider a peak as stringent t w maximum p value to consider a peak as weak c minimum number of samples with intersecting peaks needed to apply the combined evidence evaluation c maximum combined significance to confirm a peak a maximum falsewe introduced a novel and rigorous method to combine evidence in chip_seq replicates and we applied it to several encode datasets for the transcription_factor myc in the k cell_line our results confirmed that a considerable number of ers which display a weak significance in single sample analysis can be rescued by the help of co localised evidence in multiple replicates we proved that the nucleotide_sequences spanned by these weak peaks are almost always found in open_chromatin and enriched for the myc canonical e box motif for which the myc protein has the highest_affinity surprisingly even in the case of technical_replicates where reproducibility should be high we found that discarding ers only on the base of the lack of overlap often results in the dismissal of true binding_sites this can be due to the fact that our technical_replicates were simulated using a computational procedure starting from the biological_replicates available nonetheless we recommend to be careful in setting the overlapping parameter to high stringency i e c j we stress that our method works as a post_processing of a permissive peak call and it does not question the reliability of the output of the peak caller any peak caller providing a p value score can be used we recommend using the same peak caller with the same parameters on all the replicates the method has three main strengths i rigour single sample evidence from each replicate is combined through the fishers method ii versatility with the choice of a few parameters it can be decided to weight co localisation c and combined significance c differently iii efficiency typically thecomparison of the output set r o rd column with ers obtained by jmosaics th column the th and th columns show the number of peaks that are present in r o but not in the jmosaics output and the enrichment of the myc canonical e box in this last set respectively vice_versa the th and th columns show the number of peaks present in the jmosaics output but not in r o and the corresponding enrichment of the e box respectively for myc the comparison was done only with replicates and jmosaics outputs a large number of ers including most of the peaks identified by our method but only a fraction of the jmosaics specific peaks contains the myc binding_motif each e box column refers to the set described in the previous column and is marked as follows y presence of the e box n absence of the e box set too small to find any enriched
