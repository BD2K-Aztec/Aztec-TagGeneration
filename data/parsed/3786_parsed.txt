psumo cd predicting sumoylation sites in proteins with covariance discriminant algorithm by incorporating sequence coupled effects into general pseaac motivation sumoylation is a post_translational ptm process in which small ubiquitin related modifier sumo is attaching by covalent_bonds to substrate protein it is critical to many different biological_processes such as replicating genome expressing gene localizing and stabilizing proteins unfortunately it is also involved with many major disorders including alzheimers and parkinsons diseases therefore for both basic_research and drug_development it is important to identify the sumoylation sites in proteins results to address such a problem we developed a predictor called psumo cd by incorporating the sequence coupled information into the general pseudo amino_acid pseaac and introducing the covariance discriminant cd algorithm in which a bias adjustment term which has the function to automatically adjust the errors caused by the bias due to the imbalance of training data had been incorporated rigorous cross_validations indicated that the new predictor remarkably outperformed the existing state of the art prediction method for the same purpose availability_and for the convenience of most experimental scientists a user_friendly web_server for psumo cd has been established at http www jci bioinfo cn psumo cd by which users can easily obtain their desired results without the need to go through the complicated mathematical equations involved in vivo protein post_translational ptm or ptlm is an important biological mechanism for expanding the genetic_code as well as regulating cellular_physiology small_ubiquitin sumo proteins are a type of ptm that play_an in subcellular transport transcription dna_repair and signal_transduction recent researches have indicated that sumoylation can promote the binding ability of proteins and that some proteins such as claspin whose binding function is sumoylation dependent many diseases and disorders such as alzheimers and parkinsons diseases have been found to be closely_related with sumoylation therefore identification of sumoylation sites in proteins is important not only for in depth understanding many important biological_processes but also for developing_effective drugs identification of sumoylation sites with biological and chemical approaches is more laborious and slow particularly the sumoylation is reversible and instable with the avalanche of protein_sequences generated in the post genomic era it is highly demanded to develop computational_methods as a complimentary tool to the pure experimental methods actually considerable efforts have been made in this regard including the method called sumosp developed by the method sumosp byand the method gps sumo by all of them were developed using the group based phosphorylation scoring algorithm meanwhile based on support_vector svm the methods sumopre and sumohydro were developed by respectively very recently based on the linear_discriminant proposed the method sumo lda each of these methods did make contribution in stimulating the development of such an important area particularly the most recent method sumo lda which was established by combining three different types of sequence_features into the general pseudo amino_acid pseaac achieved quite decent success_rates in considering however the topics importance and also the urgency of demanding more powerful computational_tools in this area further efforts aiming at prediction of protein sumoylation sites are definitely needed the present study was initiated in an attempt to develop a new and more powerful predictor by i incorporating the vectorized sequence coupling model into the general form of pseudo amino_acid and ii installing the covariance discriminant operation engine into the prediction system rigorous cross_validations indicated that the new predictor significantly_outperformed the existing state of the art predictor in both overall accuracy and stability according to the chous step rule and concurred by many investigators in a series of recent_publications for developing a new prediction method that can be widely used by broad users we should consider the following five points i a good benchmark_dataset used to train or test the new model ii an effective mathematical formulation to represent the statistical samples concerned iii a powerful algorithm to operate the calculation iv a compelling demonstration to show its prediction quality being improved over the existing counterparts and v the prediction method should be with a web_server accessible to public below we are to address these points one by one making them very natural in logic and crystal clear in description the psumo cd predictor is a new bioinformatics tool for identifying the sumoylation sites in proteins compared with the existing state of the art predictor in this area its prediction quality is much better with remarkably_higher overall accuracy and stability for the convenience of most experimental scientists we have provided its web_server and a step_by guide by which users can easily obtain their desired results without the need to go through the detailed mathematics the reason of including them in this paper is for the integrity of the new prediction method and also for that some interesting techniques such as incorporating the sequence coupled approach into the general pseaac introducing the prior probabilitythe scores here were generated by the fold_cross on the proteins as used by histograms to show the clusters of the true and false sumoylation peptide samples that are expressed by the general pseaac of equation each of the components is marked on the horizontal axis and its average value on the vertical_axis the red histogram is for the mean value derived from the positive subset and the blue for that from the negative subset see the text for further explanationsemi screenshot of the top page for the web_server psumo cd at http www jci bioinfo cn psumo cd term in the cd algorithm to adjust the bias errors caused by unbalanced training_dataset and applying chous invariance theorem to overcome the divergence problem may be of use as well in developing other tools in computational_biology we anticipate that psumo cd will become a very useful high_throughput tool for both basic_research and drug_development in the areas relevant to the protein sumoylation
