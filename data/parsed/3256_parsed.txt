gene_expression next masigpro updating masigpro bioconductor_package for rna_seq time series motivation the widespread_adoption of rna_seq to quantitatively measure gene_expression has increased the scope of sequencing experimental_designs to include time course experiments masigpro is an r package specifically suited for the analysis of time course gene_expression data which was developed originally for microarrays and hence was limited in its application to count_data results we have updated masigpro to support rna_seq time series analysis by introducing generalized_linear in the algorithm to support the modeling of count_data while maintaining the traditional functionalities of the package we show a good performance of the masigpro glm method in several simulated time course scenarios and in a real experimental dataset availability_and the package is freely_available under the lgpl_license from the bioconductor web_site the use of rna_seq for transcriptome_profiling as a replacement for microarrays has triggered the development of statistical_methods to properly deal with the properties of these types of count_based data rna_seq measurement of gene_expression is based on the number of reads_mapped to transcripts which results in discrete quantities and left skewed distributions in contrast microarray signals are scanned fluorescence_intensities and this translates into continuous and nearly normal expression data although normality was typically assumed and linear_models lms were applied to model microarray_experiments other distributions such as poisson and negative_binomial nb capture better the nature of count_data hence methods such as edger and deseq updated microarray_analysis to rna_seq by incorporating appropriate statistical_models whereas other methodologies were developed specifically for the new technology moreover sequencing introduces specific_biases to gene_expression quantitation and therefore dedicated normalization_methods exist for rna_seq to correct for sequencing_depth transcript length gc_content and non uniform transcript distributions the first rna_seq experiments were still constrained by the relatively high_costs of sequencing in comparison with microarrays which restricted experimental_designs to casecontrol_studies with low replication as a consequence the novel statistical_methods mostly addressed this analysis scenario as the technology became more affordable other types of designs involving more samples such as time course experiments started to appear in a time course study the dynamics of gene_expression are evaluated at different time points after induction by a particular treatment or in relation to development statistical_analysis of time course data implies the identification of genes that change their expression along time and or follow a specific expression pattern masigpro is an r package designed for the analysis of transcriptomics time courses masigpro models gene_expression by polynomial_regression and identifies expression changes along one or across several time series by introducing dummy variables in the model the method progresses in two regression steps the first one selects genes with non flat profiles and the second step creates best regression_models for each gene to identify specific time or series associated changes the package includes several clustering_algorithms and visualization_tools to group and display genes with the same expression_patterns masigpro has been applied in many different biological settings such as biomedicine biotechnology and plant research to cite some and also has been implemented in several web_services and used in combination with multivariate statistics to analyze multifactorial designs or as batch filtering technique masigpro was developed to treat continuous microarray intensities and applies lms to model gene_expression in this article we describe the update of masigpro to deal with rna_seq count_data by incorporating generalized_linear into the package and allowing a more flexible choice in the reference family distribution we demonstrate the appropriateness of this adaptation using simulated_and and compare the method with edger that also accepts time course designs to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work comparison in this study the major difference between masigpro and edegr methods is that masigpro is specialized in parameter_estimation of serial data i e when the independent variable is quantitative such as time this is achieved by providing an easy way to define a polynomial model for the data that have the flexibility to fit different time course patterns in contrast edger treats time not as a continuous variable but as multifactor another important difference is that masigpro follows a second step that obtains the best model for each gene such that only significant coefficients are retained in each model whereas edger applies the same model to each gene under the multifactor consideration this results in models with more variables that might be prone to give false calls moreover we apply in the second step a filter on gene_selection that takes_into the r of the regression_model implying that only genes with a good fit to the model will be selected the consequences of the different implementations are clear in the results of the simulation_study and the experimental_data basically we observed a better control of fdrs in masigpro and that genes selected by masigpro have not only significant models but also well fitted models finally the masigpro package also provides clustering and visualization of significant genes one important aspect that we considered in our simulation_study was the number of replicates and the complexity of the random examples from genes selected with a masigpro and edger b masigpro and not with edger c with edger and not preselected with masigpro and d with edger and not with masigpro because r next masigpro time course experiment one or two comparing series our results indicate that one replicate is clearly not sufficient for the proper control of the fdrs while initial rna_seq took advantage of the accuracy of the technology to avoid replication recent_studies highlight the importance of appropriate replication for a sound rna_seq within the parameter_settings of the simulation experiment we show that masigpro glms controls fdr and fn from two replicates and that the performance improves as the number of replicates and series increase related to this it is also interesting to comment results of the masigpro lm analysis on the synthetic data while it might be obvious that lms are not appropriate to model count_data one could speculate that after data_normalization discretization would be removed and the normalized data could be treated as continuous data however transformed_data are not normally distributed and right asymmetry still holds although transformed_data do not necessarily conserve the probability_distribution of the untransformed data the glms fitting process mainly depends on the assumed variance to mean relationship linear transformations of the data do not change these relations and link functions such as the logarithm are not exclusive for discrete data this becomes evident when looking into the masigpro lm results on the simulated_data the linear_model performs poorly in most scenarios however the central_limit suggests that models developed for normal data can be applied to nonnormal data if the available sample is large enough we show that masigpro lm can achieve good fdr control when five replicates per condition are used in the two series scenario although still suffering from a significant rate of false_negative calls the versatility of the masigpro package to choose the lms or glms with one simple argument option allows easy adaptation of the methodology to the types of data and experimental_design finally although significance thresholds in masigpro glm maintain their statistical meaning the goodness_of which is used in the second step of masigpro to select genes with wellfitted models is evaluated in glms in terms of the deviance the percentage of deviance explained by the model we conducted experiments with simulated_data to understand how this parameter behaves in different experimental_settings our results indicated that similar to the recommended threshold in the lm version of masigpro a cutoff value of is valid in most scenarios however when data are abundant i e triplicated measurements and multiple series this threshold could be lowered to indeed this value was used in the analysis of the real arabidopsis dataset the comparison with edger which solely selects genes on the basis of a significant p value showed that the masigpro filtering based on a r cutoff value resulted in genes with consistent models genes that were significant with both methods but discarded by masigpro because of a r used to have outliers or highly_variable measurements in conclusion we show that masigpro glm is suitable for the identification of degs from time course rna_seq under a wide_range of experimental_settings the updated package successfully controls both false_positive detection_rates funding this work has been funded by the fp stategraproject eu
