imid integrated molecular interaction_database motivation molecular_interaction information such as protein_protein and proteinsmall molecule interactions is indispensable for understanding the mechanism of biological_processes and discovering treatments for diseases many databases have been built by manual_annotation of literature to organize such information into structured form however most databases focus on only one type of interactions which are often not well annotated and integrated with related functional information results in this study we integrate molecular_interaction information from literature by automatic information_extraction and from manually_annotated databases we further integrate the relationships between protein gene and other bio entity terms including gene_ontology pathways species and diseases to build an integrated molecular interaction_database imid interactions can be selected by their associated probabilities imid allows complex and versatile queries for context specific molecular_interactions which are not available currently in other molecular interaction_databases availability the database is located at www integrativebiology org contact molecular_interactions such as proteinprotein_interaction ppi and proteinsmall molecule interaction play_important in almost all biological_processes information on molecular_interactions is indispensable for our understanding of the mechanisms of biological_processes and for the development of drugs due to the importance of such information manual_annotation has been used to extract it from scientific_literature and deposit it into various databases in recent_years computational_methods have also been developed to extract molecular_interaction information from the literature to whom correspondence should be addressed the context of molecular_interactions such as the functions of the interactions related pathways or gene_ontology go terms and the physical nature of the interactions regulate inhibit or phosphorylate etc can be very useful for biologists searching for those interactions however current databases do not explicitly document such information in studying molecular_interactions a researcher may wish to find all protein interactions related to a particular biological_process pathway disease species or a combination of these terms such as a pathway and a species in addition the researcher may want to know those interactions related to a particular type of chemical_reaction such as phosphorylation allowing researchers to perform the above complex searches requires not only integrating the heterogeneous data from different sources but also organizing them in a highly_structured form that enables complicated queries availability of such tool will greatly help biologists in their daily research in this study we integrate molecular_interaction information from both manually_annotated databases and literature and build a relational_database integrated molecular interaction_database imid www integrativebiology org users of imid can perform complex and versatile queries for context specific molecular_interactions we expect imid to be a useful tool for researchers in biology and biomedical_sciences
