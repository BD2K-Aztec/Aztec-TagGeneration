sequence_analysis exomeai detection of recurrent allelic_imbalance in tumors using whole exome_sequencing whole_exome wes has extensively been used in cancer genome studies however the use of wes data in the study of loss_of or more generally allelic_imbalance ai has so_far been very limited which highlights the need for user_friendly and flexible software that can handle low quality datasets we have developed a statistical_approach exomeai for the detection of recurrent ai events using wes datasets specifically where matched normal samples are not available availability exomeai is a web_based application publicly_available at http in cancer recurrent genomic_aberrations are highly likely to affect oncogenes or tumor_suppressor that drive cancer_progression one efficient way to identify such aberrations is to investigate genomic profile of allelic_imbalance ai simultaneously across the genomes of a number of similar tumor_samples detection of ai is based on the study of the relative proportion of the two alleles a and b at heterozygous sites in a diploid normal heterozygous locus the expected frequency of the b allele is ratio ai is defined as a significant deviation from this proportion the genotypes b aab bb which show loss_of loh duplication and copy neutral loh respectively are examples of ai the first two cases are also examples of copy_number cna to date investigation of ai loh in cancer studies has mainly been based on single_nucleotide snp_genotyping or comparative_genomic arrays and the potential of wes data has not been fully exploited to our knowledge there is no publicly_available software for identification of recurrent genomic ai segments using wes data shared across multiple tumor only samples to address the limitation we developed a novel software exomeai which can detect recurrent ai across cancer_genomes by analyzing batches of wes data and specifically in the absence of matched normal samples we recently applied our approach to different cancer_types e g small_cell of the ovary hypercalcemic type gliomas and renal_cell our unpublished_data and successfully identified recurrent ai regions to facilitate the analysis for non computational cancer researchers using galaxy platform we implemented our approach and developed a user_friendly web_application exomeai gets a batch of tumor variant_call files as input see supplementary_information for an alternative format using preset quality filters on variants it converts read_counts for each variant to b allele_frequency baf where baf is the number of reads with the non reference base at the variant site divided by the total read_count since only heterozygous variants are informative in ai detection only variants with baf values from to default values will be used as heterozygous variants for further analysis the expected baf in a normal sample is one copy of b and one copy of a the absolute deviation of baf values dbaf from the expected value dbaf jbaf j is used for segmentation and segment wise calling segments of similar dbaf values are detected using circular_binary cbs algorithm the cbs algorithm is applied to each arm of all chromosomes for segment wise calling where matched_samples are not available the dbaf values of each segment can be compared with a fixed threshold although a fixed cutoff approach has been used successfully for snp_arrays the proper threshold may vary for wes datasets with different qualities e g varying sequencing_depths we propose a two step approach we first call ai at each variant over the genome using a binomial_test and we calculate the mean dbaf values for non ai variants in the second step a wilcoxon_signed is performed to evaluate the distribution of dbaf in each segment see supplementary_information for details one of the main_issues in ai or cna calling is false_positives which gets even more challenging when the matched normal sample is not available in cancer analysis it is desirable to remove candidate segments that may either represent common copy_number cnvs or technology or alignment artifacts in order to remove false_positives calls we created a control database of non cancer wes samples the database is kept updated the statistically_significant ai segments will then be compared with the control database to find the number of hits within the database by default exomeai counts each overlap of the control database with more than of the query segment as one hit in the next step the significant segments that were not seen or seen less than a given to whom correspondence should be addressed frequency in the control database will be used to find the recurrent ai the output of this final step will be a list of identified segments with names and number of tumor_samples that share the segment supplementary along with the plots of the segments for each chromosome supplementary figs s and s
