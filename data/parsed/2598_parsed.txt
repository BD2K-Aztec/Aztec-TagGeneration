genetics_and motivation rapid advances in genotyping and genome_wide have enabled the discovery of many new genotypephenotype associations at the resolution of individual_markers however these associations explain only a small proportion of theoretically estimated heritability of most diseases in this work we propose an integrative mixture_model called jbase joint bayesian_analysis of subphenotypes and epistasis jbase explores two major reasons of missing_heritability interactions between genetic_variants a phenomenon known as epistasis and pheno typic heterogeneity addressed via subphenotyping results our extensive simulations in a wide_range of scenarios repeatedly demonstrate that jbase can identify true underlying subphenotypes including their associated variants and their interactions with high_precision in the presence of phenotypic heterogeneity jbase has higher power and lower type error than five state of the art approaches we applied our method to a sample of individuals from mexico with type_diabetes and discovered two novel epistatic modules including two loci each that define two subphenotypes characterized by differences in body_mass and waist_to we successfully replicated these subphenotypes and epistatic modules in an independent dataset from mexico genotyped with a different platform availability_and jbase is implemented in c supported on linux and is available atgenome wide association studies gwas have been successful in identifying thousands of novel disease markers however the discovered associations explain only a small proportion of theoretically estimated heritability of most diseases this is referred to as the missing_heritability problem among the main hypotheses attempting to explain the missing_heritability four of them can be addressed with more detailed genetic data and more advanced methods i rare_variants and structural_variants svs which are not covered by the common single_nucleotide snp_arrays used in gwas ii spurious_associations caused by population_stratification iii interactions between variants i e epistasis and iv phenotypic heterogeneity solutions to each problem have been sought with varying_degrees of success for example full assessment of the impact of rare_variants and svs on phenotypic_variation requires larger cohorts which is becoming feasible with affordable sequencing_technologies and meta studies it is now possible to detect and remove spurious_associations using efficient linear_mixed in this article we focus on epistasis and phenotype heterogeneitytwo major computational problems potentially contributing to missing_heritability recent large_scale genomic studies on model_organisms as well as theoretical findings revealed that epistasis may hinder identification of genetic_associations it is possible to categorize epistasis detection_algorithms into three types i pre gwas algorithms that were mostly developed for small_scale datasets e g multi factor dimensionality_reduction ii exhaustive_search algorithms such as team sixpac and gwis which scale to gwas datasets but only detect pairwise and often limited types of interactions and iii stochastic search_methods such as beam a generative latent_variable framework that models marginal independently acting and epistatic_effects allowing for any number of interactions its successors include beam and beam most of these methods rely on markov_chain for inference many complex human_diseases such as autism diabetes and cancer are very heterogeneous for example it has been observed that risk_variants associated with type_diabetes t d differ in patients with high and low body_mass bmis similarly in medulloblastoma analysis of genomes revealed extensive subgroup specific variants that give rise to subgroup specific phenotypes i e subphenotypes there is now increasing evidence from breast_cancer hearing_loss cholesterol related_disorders mental_illnesses and t d studies that many complex_diseases may be better characterized as a collection of distinct and less common subdiseases disease heterogeneity if not taken into account can have profound consequences on the success of association studies it reduces statistical_power causal_variants and confounds replication studies such that true associations fail to replicate and become classified as false_positives and also a detailed discussion in supplementary_material section s subphenotyping attempts to solve these problems by automatically stratifying the global_population to identify homogeneous patient subgroups several approaches have recently been developed to address disease heterogeneity in the context of the missing_heritability problem these approaches can be grouped into two categories i those with prior_knowledge of subphenotypes and ii those that simultaneously infer both subphenotypes and associated markers in the first case the grouping information might come from prior medical_knowledge e g in t d the cases were stratified according to patients bmi using canonical bmi categories of obese versus non obese however relying only on prior_knowledge limits the space of accessible discoveries moreover it is also undesirable as subphenotypes often give rise to overlapping multivariate phenotype distributions which cannot be studied with hard thresholdbased approaches simultaneous identification of subgroups and group specific markers removes the bias of potentially arbitrary thresholds while enabling the study of overlapping subphenotypes the snpmix approach addresses this problem by modeling the population as a mixture of subphenotypes with individual to subgroup assignment being unknown and trying to simultaneously identify marginally affecting markers and subgroup assignments this is a promising first step but it focuses solely on marginal associations joint models for partitioning genotype and phenotype simultaneously have been proposed in the expression_quantitative eqtl framework methods described in kim and xing andidentify modules of genes and corresponding variants the partitioning in these models is in the gene space rather than in the patient space thus these models are not directly applicable to our problem a notable_exception is which proposes a bayesian partitioning method in the eqtl context that not only models marginal and epistatic_effects of variants explaining gene_expression modules but also encodes potential partitioning of the cohort unfortunately there are several key_properties of this model that make it inapplicable to subphenotyping for example the variable corresponding to the partitioning of individuals is integrated out i e it is not actually inferred additionally the groupings of individuals are independent between eqtl modules thus as is shown in the real case scenario in each module has its own subgroup of individuals without any way to reconcile them to summarize zhang et_al a does not infer subphenotypes with respect to the disease but uses the idea of subgroups of individuals to identify more meaningful eqtl modules the only way to coercemodel to ourin the case population is hidden or is not accounted for can recover only shared causal markers snp b subphenotyping approach to the same data recovers both shared snp and subphenotype causal specific markers snp snp and snp setting would be to set the number of modules to however this would mean that there would have to be only one genotypic module that has to explain the full heterogeneity of the data an assumption that is not supported by the current line of evidence on the genetics of subphenotypes motivated by the fact that epistasis and phenotype heterogeneity represent two of the main challenges for the missing_heritability problem and the fact that none of the existing_methods address both issues simultaneously we introduce the jbase model which accounts for epistasis and subphenotyping while providing an easily_interpretable probabilistic_framework where n mar kmj is the number of individuals in subpopulation k that has jth genotype for marker m markers in the epistatic component are assumed to be generated by a single multinomial distribution as each marker can have three states this multinomial distribution can have e k jg k j states i e interactions whose frequencies are governed by the parameter k k e k thus we get where n epi kj denotes the number of individuals in subpopulation k with the genotype combination j over the epistatic markers note that e k and hence the dimensionality of k vary depending on the state of s k see_supplementary section s for details the last genotype component to model is the null component the parameters of the null component are shared across all components i e a marker that is not related to the phenotype should have the same allelic distribution as other subpopulations in which it is assigned to the null component let w m w m w m w m be the genotype_frequencies of a marker m in the general_population then we have where n null mj is the number of the occurrence of state j for marker m across all individuals where it is classified as a null marker the final component of the likelihood is the phenotype in this work we have focused on categorical phenotypes only we model the phenotype likelihood as a multinomial distribution parameterized with x k x k x kt where t is the number of all possible combinations of values of the different phenotypic variables which is fixed based on cardinality of the multinomial distribution and n phe kt is the number of individuals in subpopulation k with a phenotype value t putting these together we get the following form for likelihood pdjw h x c s where we used g to denote the collection of null components across all subphenotypes using conjugate dirichlet priors for w h and x as well as for the mixing coefficient parameter vectors p and a allows us to integrate out all of the model_parameters q fw h x p ag except latent_variables c and s see_supplementary section s for details the final form of the posterior is presented in equation as such the posterior_distribution depends only on the hyperparameters h fq b k c s dg which are given as input and the latent_variables c and s which are inferred we perform inference via sampling from the posterior using the metropolis hastings algorithm see_supplementary sections s and s for details it is also worth mentioning that jbase can control for linkage_disequilibrium ld which can introduce false_positive epistatis and for population_stratification for ld jbase accepts an optional input_file that lists the markers known to be in ld with associated lists of linked markers jbase via its proposal distribution on s km ensures that linked marker pairs are never assigned to marginal and or epistatic components simultaneously in addition one can also specify an optional genomic_distance threshold such that markers closer than the given distance are not allowed to be simultaneously assigned to the marginal and or epistatic component of a subpopulation as for population_stratification jbase leverages the information obtained from the principal_component pca of individuals by ensuring that the subpopulation means of the most important pca dimension s do not significantly differ between subpopulations see_supplementary section s this is achieved by rejecting proposals on variable c i if it causes the means between subphenotypes to diverge beyond a threshold other biological constraints can easily be integrated into the proposal distribution of the metropolis hastings algorithm by eliminating the undesirable assignments from the state_space of the posterior_distribution
