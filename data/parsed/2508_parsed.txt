systems_biology integrating_multiple resources to identify specific transcriptional cooperativity with a bayesian approach_motivation limited cohort of transcription_factors is capable to structure various gene_expression transcriptional cooperativity tc is deemed to be the main mechanism of complexity and precision in regulatory programs although many data types generated from numerous experimental_technologies are utilized in an attempt to understand combinational transcriptional_regulation complementary computational_approach that can integrate diverse data resources and assimilate them into biological model is still under development results we developed a novel bayesian_approach for integrative_analysis of proteomic transcriptomic and genomic_data to identify specific tc the model evaluation demonstrated distinguishable power of features derived from distinct data_sources and their essen tiality to model performance our model outperformed other classifiers and alternative_methods the application that contextualized tc within hepatocarcinogenesis revealed carcinoma associated alterations derived tc networks were highly_significant in capturing validated cooperativity as well as revealing novel ones our methodology is the first multiple data_integration approach to predict dynamic nature of tc it is promising in identifying tissue or disease specific tc and can further facilitate the interpretation of underlying_mechanisms for various physiological_conditions contact in the human_genome genes manifest dramatic diversity in terms of expression levels and tissue or condition specific expression_patterns despite this tremendous diversity all genes are controlled by numbered transcription_factors tfs tfs can work as monomers homodimers and heterodimers to facilitate as an activator or inhibit as a repressor the recruitment of rna_polymerase and display high_specificity in ligand activation thereby precisely controlling the condition_dependent expression of target_genes tgs tf_activity and interaction is characterized of condition dependence and transience such mutual regulation among tfs underlies major features of cellular identity and complex functions such as pluripotency development and differentiation even diseases which makes the study of transcriptional cooperativity tc of paramount importantance the development of numerous experimental_technologies including whole_genome large_scale expression_profiling yeast_two experiments and emerging chromatin_immunoprecipitation makes it possible to understand the combinational transcriptional_regulation from various perspectives biologically_relevant synergistic_interactions between different tfs are discovered in yeast by insight into gene_expression data proteinprotein_interaction ppi data is also used to infer synergistic binding of cooperative tfs another study that can indicate the interactions between tfs is based on the genome_sequence b more recently the encode consortium provides comprehensive chromatin_immunoprecipitation coupled with high_throughput sequencing_data for reliable view of tf_binding interaction previous_studies on the investigation of tc are reasonable in assumptions or biology many tfs bind_dna preferentially at characteristic sequence_motifs thereby providing the sequence_specificity required to reflect the possible spatial relationships between tfs in terms of preferences in distance and orientation the interaction between two proteins indicates they contribute to the same or similar biological_processes the gene profiles reveal the similarity between gene_expressions which could be used to infer synergistic relationships between tfs when their common tgs show highly_correlated expression_patterns although previous_studies have made encouraging progress the investigation of tc encounters four major challenges i the time consumption and high_costs of valid experiments ii the vast_majority of tfs not being experimentally profiled genome_wide iii the difficulty of interrogating the activities of multiple_tfs within the same cellular_environment iv mainly focusing on static or global interaction but ignoring the dynamic nature of tc all of these have underscored the need to integrate various data and construct a complementary computational_approach that can assimilate them into biological_models the tc defined in this article broadly means the functional interaction between different dna_binding tfs in regulation of gene_expression it could be physical genetic or regulatory interaction between tfs competitive or synergetic co regulation furthermore tf homodimer interactions and interactions to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com between tfs and non dna_binding cofactors as well as cooperativity among multiple_tfs are not within our research emphasis in this article we proposed a novel algorithm based on bayesian theory for integrative_analysis of diverse large_scale biological data to identify tc our strategy is based on hypothesis that cooperative tf pairs share shorter distance in ppi_network closer spatial_relationship on promoter_regions stronger distance constraint among binding_sites and higher correlation on gene_expression pattern we derived four features and tested their discrimination based on hepg golden_standard dataset benchmark analyses were implemented for the assessment of model performance compared with individual feature and straight logistic_regression as well as one feature removed bayesian_model furthermore we performed comparison with other existing_methods bayesian_approach was then applied to contextualize tc within hepatocellular_carcinoma hcc progression
