structural_bioinformatics scpc a method to structurally compare protein_complexes motivation proteinprotein_interactions play vital functional_roles in various biological_phenomena physical contacts between proteins have been revealed using experimental_approaches that have solved the structures of protein_complexes at atomic_resolution to examine the huge number of protein_complexes available in the protein_data an efficient automated method that compares protein_complexes is required results we have developed structural_comparison of protein_complexes scpc a novel method to structurally compare protein_complexes scpc compares the spatial arrangements of subunits in a complex with those in another complex using secondary_structure similar substructures are detected in two protein_complexes and the similarity is scored scpc was applied to dimers homo oligomers and haemoglobins scpc properly estimated structural_similarities between the dimers examined as well as an existing method mm align conserved substructures were detected in a homo tetramer and a homo hexamer composed of homologous_proteins classification of quaternary_structures of haemoglobins using scpc was consistent with the conventional classification the results demonstrate that scpc is a valuable_tool to investigate the structures of protein_complexes availability scpc is available at http idp force cs is nagoya u ac jp scpc proteins are crucial molecules in biological_phenomena that function via specific interactions with target_molecules including small ligand_molecules other proteins and nucleic_acids such molecular_interactions are involved in biological_processes including various kinds of metabolism signal_transduction and transcriptional_regulation numerous proteinprotein_interactions have been experimentally_identified using high_throughput techniques such as the yeast_two system and the results are available in open public_databases in addition structures of protein_complexes have been to whom correspondence should be addressed determined at atomic_resolution by x_ray or nuclear_magnetic and this information has been deposited in the protein_data pdb currently the number of structural complexes in the pdb is rapidly increasing supplementary to process such large_numbers of structural complexes and derive valuable biological_insights from them an automated method to compare the structures of protein_complexes is required data_processing of the huge amount of sequences and structures of biomacromolecules has been facilitated by automated comparison methods for example the needleman wunsch algorithm fasta blast and the s search for protein and nucleic_acid and dali ssap vast ce matras and tm_align for protein_structures these methods have also made significant_contributions to various studies on the structure function and evolution of biomacromolecules an improved understanding of many aspects of structural complexes and proteinprotein_interactions is obtained by employing automated comparison methods one of these is the comparative_analysis of structural complexes composed of evolutionary related proteins when proteins constitute a protein complex their orthologous_proteins also frequently form complexes by applying an automated comparison method to these protein_complexes the evolutionary_relationships between structure variation and sequence_diversity can be revealed such a method also enables us to compare a query structural complex with each structure in databases and retrieve the structures that are similar to the query structure this approach can be further extended to an exhaustive comparison among all existing structures of protein_complexes similar structures are grouped into a cluster and a variety of clusters each consisting of similar complexes are subsequently obtained from the analysis the resulting data present a comprehensive classification of protein_complexes therefore the development of an automated method to compare the structures of protein_complexes would facilitate future_investigations into protein_complexes and proteinprotein_interactions in general in the comparison of two structural complexes each subunit of a complex exclusively corresponds to one subunit of the other complex exploring subunit correspondence is a unique process of comparing protein_complexes that is not required for comparing protein_structures currently only a few methods have been proposed investigated structures of dimeric proteins in which the subunit correspondence was provided in
