data_and pie the search searching pubmed literature for protein interaction information motivation finding protein_protein ppi_information from literature is challenging but an important issue however keyword_search in pubmed is often time consuming because it requires a series of actions that refine keywords and browse search results until it reaches a goal due to the rapid_growth of biomedical_literature it has become more difficult for biologists and curators to locate ppi_information quickly therefore a tool for prioritizing ppi informative articles can be a useful assistant for finding this ppi relevant_information results pie protein interaction information_extraction the search is a web_service implementing a competition winning approach utilizing word and syntactic analyses by machine_learning for easy user access pie the search provides a pubmed like search environment but the output is the list of articles prioritized by ppi confidence_scores by obtaining ppi related_articles at high rank researchers can more easily find the up to date ppi_information which cannot be found in manually_curated ppi databases researchers keep track of protein_protein ppi_information by searching literature online or using ppi database services when using ppi databases well summarized information can be obtained but newly_discovered evidence may be missed due to the rapid_growth of the biomedical_literature and time consuming manual_curation process for online literature_search people commonly find relevant_information in pubmed by exploring a combination of keywords e g protein_names journal names or author names this step can be time consuming however the interactive query retrieval process by manual effort can reach better and more focused ppi_information automatic article recommendation for ppi_information can be therefore positioned between ppi database services and manual literature_search because to whom correspondence should be addressed it provides more effective retrieval by suggesting ppi informative articles ppi articles from simple user queries ppi extraction tasks require several prerequisite steps such as gene mention gene normalization ppi article filtering or ppi experimental method extraction although article filtering is an essential step among those tasks it has been often neglected by previous protein interaction extraction systems improving ppi article classification enables better literature navigation for biologists effective assistance for curators in manually updating repositories and better literature mining system development for text_mining researchers pie the search is an online web_service to assist in finding ppi articles from pubmed pie the search provides the following novel features distinguished from other ppi services first it navigates ppi specific articles for biologists and curators second it provides a compact pubmed_search environment to help easy access for pubmed users third users can easily find the up to date ppi_information which has not been curated in ppi databases since the proposed system implements the recent competition winning approach in biocreative bc iii it also guarantees the state of the art performance among various methods shows the overall architecture of the pie the search system the web_interface module manages the whole process of ppi article prediction for users for user queries pubmed ids are first retrieved through online pubmed services ppi confidence_scores are calculated for retrieved_articles and articles are re ranked based on scores for protein name queries this process does not guarantee highly ranked articles that contain query specific ppis however it is still likely to have useful ppi_information related to protein queries the prediction module learns and classifies pubmed articles to effectively capture ppi patterns from biomedical_literature our approach utilizes both word and syntactic features in a machine_learning framework dependency parsing gene mention tagging and termbased features are utilized along with a huber classifier since pie the search is designed to provide only compact but necessary features for ppi article search its use is very straightforward especially for pubmed users it accepts pubmed input_formats including all fields author journal mesh_terms publication date title and title abstract with boolean operations and or and not however the output is the list of articles prioritized by ppi confidence_scores search results can be sorted by either ppi scores or dates with the date sorting only articles with ppi scores will appear for convenient use there are no page changespie the search is a web_service designed for searching ppi articles from pubmed which employs word and syntactic features in a machine_learning framework compared to previous ppi article classification approaches this method actively utilizes syntactic information the priority model and huber classifiers are also a distinctive choice for effectively handling pubmed data pie the search is already practical as a ranking system since it provides high classification_performance at topranked articles the web_service is freely_accessible and the local pubmed_database in pie is being updated monthly
