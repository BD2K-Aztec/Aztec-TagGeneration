gene_expression automatically identifying and annotating mouse_embryo gene_expression motivation deciphering the regulatory and developmental_mechanisms for multicellular_organisms requires_detailed of gene interactions and gene_expressions the availability of large_datasets with both spatial and ontological annotation of the spatio temporal_patterns of gene_expression in mouse_embryo provides a powerful resource to discover the biological_function of embryo organization ontological annotation of gene_expressions consists of labelling images with terms from the anatomy ontology for mouse development if the spatial genes of an anatomical component are expressed in an image the image is then tagged with a term of that anatomical component the current annotation is done manually by domain_experts which is both time consuming and costly in addition the level of detail is variable and inevitably errors arise from the tedious nature of the task in this article we present a new method to automatically identify and annotate gene_expression in the mouse_embryo with anatomical terms results the method_takes images from in situ_hybridization studies and the ontology for the developing mouse_embryo it then combines machine_learning and image_processing to produce classifiers that automatically identify and annotate gene_expression in these images we evaluate our method on image data from the eurexpress study where we use it to automatically classify nine anatomical terms humerus handplate fibula tibia femur ribs petrous part scapula and head mesenchyme the accuracy of our method lies between and with few exceptions we show that other known methods have lower classification_performance than ours we have investigated the images misclassified by our method and found several cases where the original annotation was not correct this shows our method is robust against this kind of noise availability the annotation result and the experimental dataset in the article can be freely accessed atunderstanding the role of expression of a given gene and interactions between genes in the developmental_processes of multicellular_organisms requires monitoring the gene_expression levels and spatial_distributions on a large_scale two highthroughput methods have been widely used to curate gene_expression at different developmental_stages of organisms including dna_microarrays and rna_in ish dna_microarrays measure gene_expression levels of a large_number for a tissue_sample or cell which can reflect the relative changes of gene expression_level in each individual gene during time courses however it does not provide spatial gene_expression rna ish uses specific gene_probes to detect and visualize spatialtemporal information of particular target_genes in tissues it offers the possibility to construct a transcriptome_wide atlas of multicellular_organisms that can provide spatial gene pattern information for comprehensive analysis of the gene interactions and developmental biological_processes the result of rna ish consists of images of sections of tissue stained to reveal the presence of gene_expression to understand gene_functions and interactions of genes in depth we need to transform the raw image data into detailed knowledge annotation of gene_expression in the raw images from rna ish provides a powerful way to address_this the process of annotating gene_expression pattern comprises the labelling of images with ontological terms corresponding to anatomical components for every anatomical component that shows expression in the image the image is labelled with that anatomical component using an hierarchically_structured ontology that describes the developing mouse_embryo much effort has been devoted to the curation of gene_expression in the developmental_biology for example the eurexpress project has built a transcriptomewide atlas for the developing mouse_embryo established by rna ish it has so_far collected more than genes at one development stage of wild_type murine embryos and has curated tb of images some studies have been conducted on drosophila gene_expression for instance the research inhas produced genes for genome_wide analysis on drosophila many other spatial gene_expression generated via rna ish such as flybase and mouse atlas provide rich_information for genetics currently all annotations of spatial gene_expression is hand curated by domain_experts with large amount of curated image
