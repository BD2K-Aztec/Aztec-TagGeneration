dragon polya spotter predictor of poly a motifs within human_genomic sequences motivation recognition of poly a signals in mrna is relatively straightforward due to the presence of easily_recognizable polyadenylic_acid tail however the task of identifying poly a motifs in the primary genomic dna_sequence that correspond to poly a signals in mrna is a far more challenging_problem recognition of poly a signals is important for better gene_annotation and understanding of the gene_regulation mechanisms in this work we present one such poly a motif prediction method based on properties of human_genomic sequence surrounding a poly a motif these properties include thermodynamic physico_chemical and statistical characteristics for predictions we developed artificial_neural and random_forest models these models are trained to recognize most common poly a motifs in human dna our predictors are available as a free web_based accessible at http cbrc kaust edu sa dps compared with other reported predictors our models achieve_higher sensitivity_and and furthermore provide a consistent level of accuracy for poly a motif variants the polyadenylic_acid tail or poly a tail is a stretch of a nucleotides added to rna during the rna_processing mainly to protect the primary rna_stability in mammals the poly a tail is added close and downstream of the characteristic poly a signal most often aauaaa the problem of prediction of poly a signals has_received since the distance of poly a signal from the poly a tail is approximately nt recognizing such tails in mrna is relatively simple a more challenging_problem is to find a motif in primary genomic_sequence that corresponds to poly a signal site in the transcribed rna the process of predicting poly a motifs in dna depends on successfully identifying relevant properties of the surrounding sequence of such motifs we now present a brief survey of reported work in this field so_far statistical_properties of nucleotide_sequences were used for example to reveal putative poly a signals in yeast or in arabidopsis a program probe was developed to identify cis_elements that potentially play regulatory_roles in mrna polyadenylation several tools are developed for predicting poly a motifs in human polyadq tool for predicting poly a motifs in a dna_sequence is reported inwhere sequences of nt downstream of a candidate poly a motif were used to derive the feature_set for prediction the erpin program utilizes nt flanking_sequence upstream and downstream of the candidate poly a motifs a method based on application of support_vector svms was reported byin which nt flanking_sequence upstream and downstream around poly a candidate motifs were utilized polyapred system was introduced in the nt flanking_sequence upstream and downstream around candidate poly a motif sequence were utilized a method polyar for recognition of polyadenylation_sites is reported recently the reported results of these tools are summarized in together with the performance of publicly_available ones achieved on our datasets in this study we present a web_based that implements two types of predictive_models one based on artificial_neural anns and the other based on random_forest rf our models cover main variants of human poly a motifs with accuracies from to for performance we used sensitivity se tp tp fn specificity sp tn tn fp and accuracy acc tp tn tp tn fp fn where tp tn fp and fn are the numbers of true_positives true_negatives false_positives respectively we compared our results those of publicly_available tools when applied to our datasets we tested on the only motif common to all tools aataaa in we report the performance of our ann and rf derived models on poly a motifs ann model is trained on of data and tested on the remaining training takes a long time so cross_validation is not applied for the rf model we achieved the best results using trees without restricting maximal depth using nine random features per node model performance in fold_cross is shown we developed a web_tool for the recognition of poly a motifs in human_genomic that demonstrates improved prediction_accuracy over the existing publicly_available poly a predictors we hope that our tool will find good use in the studies of human gene properties
