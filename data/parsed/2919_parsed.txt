database and ontologies metarep jcvi metagenomics reports an open_source tool for high performance comparative_metagenomics jcvi metagenomics reports metarep is a web application designed to help scientists analyze and compare annotated metagenomics datasets it utilizes solr lucene a high performance scalable search_engine to quickly query large data collections furthermore users can use its sql like query syntax to filter and refine datasets metarep provides graphical summaries for top taxonomic and functional classifications as well as a go ncbi taxonomy and kegg_pathway browser users can compare absolute and relative counts of multiple datasets at various functional and taxonomic_levels advanced comparative features comprise statistical_tests as well as multidimensional_scaling heatmap and hierarchical_clustering plots summaries can be exported as tab_delimited files publication quality plots in pdf format a data management layer allows collaborative data analysis and result sharing availability web siterecent advances in sequencing_technologies have boosted microbial_ecology research by allowing cost_effective sequencing of microbial_communities directly from their natural environment as of today microbial metagenomes sampled from diverse environments such as the ocean acid_mine soil bovine rumen and the human_body have been reported http www genomesonline org such studies promise to reveal new insights into how microbes adapt to their abiotic_and environment to distill such information from metagenomic_sequences computational_methods are being used to identify and analyze their functional and taxonomic signatures metagenomic annotation_pipelines have been developed that help researchers to identify such information to make higher_level inferences from such annotated data computational_biologists have developed various analysis tools megan for example allows users to import blast outputs to generate taxonomic and functionala variety of metagenomics analysis tools are provided either as standalone or via the web the strength of our web based_approach is a generic data model indexed by a high performance search_engine in combination with a user_friendly web interface jcvis annotated metagenomes as well as other selected public datasets can be accessed at www jcvi org metarep users that wish to analyze their own metagenomics_data must install the software and import their own annotations we invite interested programmers to contribute to the metarep open_source project hosted at http github com jcvi metarep finally users are encouraged to suggest additional features of interest
