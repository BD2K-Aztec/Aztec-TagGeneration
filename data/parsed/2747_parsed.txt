structural_bioinformatics logicoil multi state prediction of coiled_coil oligomeric_state motivation the coiled_coil is a ubiquitous helical protein_structure domain that directs and facilitates proteinprotein_interactions in a wide_variety at the protein_sequence level the coiled_coil is readily recognized via a conspicuous heptad_repeat of hydrophobic and polar_residues however structurally coiled_coils are more complicated existing in a wide_range of oligomer states and topologies as a consequence predicting these various states from sequence remains an unmet challenge results this work introduces logicoil the first algorithm to address the problem of predicting multiple coiled_coil oligomeric states from protein_sequence alone by covering of the known coiled_coil structures logicoil is a net improvement compared with other existing_methods which achieve a predictive coverage of of this population this leap in predictive_power offers better opportunities for genome_scale analysis and analyses of coiled_coil containing protein assemblies availability logicoil is available via a web_interface at http coiledcoils chm bris ac uk logicoil source_code training_sets and supporting_information can be downloaded from the same site coiled_coils are protein_structure domains that comprise two or more helices that wrap around each other typically in a left_handed fashion and which interact through specific packing interactions known as knobs into hole packing although accounting for range of the protein encoding regions of genes coiled_coils are also actively involved in the mediation of proteinprotein_interactions across a wide_array of biological_functions from transcription through membrane remodelling to cell and tissue structure and stability despite its functional_diversity the coiled_coil is characterized by a straightforward sequence_motif of hydrophobic h and polar p residues the positions within this hpphppp motif referred to as the heptad_repeat are typically labelled a through g with hydrophobic_residues generally occupying the a and d positions and polar_residues falling at the other positions given this common sequence pattern the d structures adopted by naturally_occurring coiled_coils display a remarkable diversity applying socket an algorithm that finds knobs into holes packing interactions within structurally resolved proteins to the research collaboratory for structural_bioinformatics protein_data rcsb_pdb reveals an abundance of coiled_coil architectures and topologies indeed coiled_coil assemblies have been shown to contain different numbers of helices of parallel or anti_parallel orientation that may be formed from the same homo or different hetero helical sequences here we focus on the prediction of coiled_coil oligomeric_state six algorithms exist to tackle this problem scorer which has been recently redefined and retrained in scorer and procoil achieve high_success when separating coiled_coil sequences but these methods are strictly limited to the discrimination of parallel dimeric and parallel trimeric coiled_coil structures multicoil and its predecessor multicoil follow a different approach to predict both the location and oligomeric_state of coiled_coils in protein_sequences however their oligomeric_state functions remain_limited to the discrimination of parallel dimers and trimers thus these algorithms cover only a small subset of the known coiled_coil structural space limiting their usefulness for example antiparallel dimers so_far excluded from all prediction analysis account for well of the total coiled_coil structure population and represent a wealth of untapped data current de_novo methods cover only of the coiled_coil population thus simple inclusion of antiparallel dimeric and tetrameric structures would increase coverage to homology based_approaches such as spiricoil partially accomplish the task of multi state coiled_coil oligomeric_state prediction but cannot be used to classify the oligomeric_state of coiled_coil sequences ab_initio that is those without structurally defined precedents as a consequence we regard the development of an ab_initio multi state predictor to be the next logical step in coiled_coil structure analysis and prediction to the best of our knowledge no work has yet treated the ab_initio problem of multi state classification of coiled_coil oligomers as previous attempts have focussed on two state predictions and therefore have been tailored towards binary response problems they could not be systematically extended for the purpose of multi state classification as to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com such the problem required the development of statistical_techniques and algorithm capable of discriminating between multiple coiled_coil oligomeric states
