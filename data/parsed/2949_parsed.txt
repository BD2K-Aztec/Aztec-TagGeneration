systems_biology metscape a cytoscape plug in for visualizing and interpreting metabolomic_data in the context of human metabolic_networks metscape is a plug in for cytoscape used to visualize and interpret metabolomic_data in the context of human metabolic_networks we have developed a metabolite database by extracting and integrating information from several public sources by querying this database metscape allows users to trace the connections between metabolites and genes visualize compound networks and display compound structures as well as information for reactions enzymes genes and pathways applying the pathway filter users can create subnetworks that consist of compounds and reactions from a given pathway metscape allows users to upload experimental_data and visualize and explore compound networks over time or experimental_conditions color and size of the nodes are used to visualize these dynamic changes metscape can display the entire metabolic_network or any of the pathway specific networks that exist in the database availability metscape can be installed from within cytoscape x under network and attribute i o category for more information please visit http metscape ncibi org tryplugin htmlmetabolomics is a rapidly emerging field that is joining other high_throughput omics such as proteomics and transcriptional_profiling it promises to be a powerful systems approach for studying metabolic_profiles pertinent to a variety of normal and disease_states transcriptional_profiling and proteomics have established data analysis tools a metabolomics analytical toolkit is yet to be developed an important step in metabolomic_data analysis is examining experimental_data in the context of metabolic_networks a number of tools have been developed for the interactive_exploration of metabolic_pathways to whom correspondence should be addressed several databases describing human metabolic_networks have been published kegg ehmn hmdb visual_analysis has been shown to be effective in facilitating human_cognition in exploratory_analysis with bioinformatics_tools cytoscape is a highly popular java_based open_source that is used by biomedical_researchers to visualize and dynamically analyze gene protein_interaction cytoscape is a powerful stand alone tool but its strength is even more apparent when it is coupled with databases a number of plug_ins mimi plug in pathway_commons etc have been developed to interact with various databases here we describe metscape a cytoscape plug in for visualizing and interpreting metabolomic_data in the context of human metabolic_networks metscape see_supplementary for the comparison of metscape and other tools provides a bioinformatics framework for the analysis and interpretation of metabolomic_data metabolomic_data from humdb ehmn and kegg are integrated and stored in a database at ncibi metscape provides users an interface to query the database visualizing a compound network helps users to trace connections between metabolites and genes and understand the relationships between compounds reactions enzymes genes and pathways visualizing metabolites with node color and size changes in a network at a series of time points can help users to predict functions of metabolites linking compounds and reactions to well known metabolomic data_sources helps researchers to verify and better understand the presented metabolites since march when the first version of metscape was released we have had unique ips users user_groups and the number is still growing for future work we plan to integrate more data from additional databases and provide more information like enzyme activators and inhibitors from databases such as brenda
