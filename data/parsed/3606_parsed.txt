popdrowser the population drosophila browser motivation the completion of genome_sequences from a single population of drosophila_melanogaster provides a global view of genomic_variation and an understanding of the evolutionary_forces shaping the patterns of dna polymorphism and divergence along the genome results we present the population drosophila browser popdrowser a new genome_browser specially_designed for the automatic_analysis and representation of genetic_variation across the d melanogaster genome_sequence popdrowser allows estimating and visualizing the values of a number of dna polymorphism and divergence summary_statistics linkage_disequilibrium parameters and several neutrality tests popdrowser also allows performing custom analyses on the fly using user selected parameters availability popdrowser is freely_available from http popdrowser population_genetics studies have been so_far based on fragmentary and non random_samples of genomes providing a partial and often biased view of the population_genetics processes a new dimension to genetic_variation studies is provided by the new availability of within species genomes nextgeneration_sequencing are making affordable genomewide population_genetics data not only for humans and the main model_organisms but also for most organisms on which research is actively carried_out on genetics ecology or evolution genome_browsers are very useful tools to query and visualize disparate annotations at different genomic_locations using a web user_interface a number of web_based genome_browsers displaying genetic_variation data are already available such browsers however are not well suited to deal with population_genomics sequence_information for example hapmap the most comprehensive
