data_and a mutation_profile for top k patient search exploiting gene_ontology and orthogonal non_negative motivation as the quantity of genomic mutation data increases the likelihood of finding patients with similar genomic_profiles for various disease inferences increases however so does the difficulty in identifying them similarity_search based on patient mutation profiles can solve various translational bioinformatics tasks including prognostics and treatment efficacy predictions for better clinical_decision through large_volume of data however this is a challenging_problem due to heterogeneous and sparse characteristics of the mutation data as well as their high_dimensionality results to solve this problem we introduce a compact_representation and search_strategy based on gene_ontology and orthogonal non_negative statistical_significance between the identified cancer_subtypes and their clinical_features are computed for validation results show that our method can identify and characterize clinically_meaningful tumor_subtypes comparable or better in most datasets than the recently_introduced network based stratification method while enabling real_time search to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to simultaneously characterize and represent somatic mutational data for efficient_search purposes due to advancements of genome_scale sequencing_data of patients sequencing will become a common practice in medicine in the near future the amount of patient_records that include gene_mutation data will be huge as the quantity of genomic mutation data increases the likelihood of finding patients with similar genomic_profiles for various disease inferences increases however so does the difficulty in identifying them even with the significance of the impact and need genomic based patient similarity searching has not yet been actively studied by the bioinformatics community we proposed a compact_representation for genome mutation this representation is called the onmf mutation_profile onmf mp it is used for efficient_search and characterization of patients genome data and provides basic information for many data_mining tasks in translational bioinformatics the onmf mp uses onmp to exploit the functional representation property of go and the ability to correlate go terms that are latent in a collection of genome mutation data this representation solves the sparsity problem of mutation data and achieves reduced sensitivity to heterogeneous factors it also enables genome based real_time search for similar patients we show experimentally that stratification results using the proposed representation have comparable or better correlations with clinical_features than do those achieved using a recently_introduced method insufficient clinical information prevents us from using the all five cancer_types for the two the validation test to make the validation complete however this is not an inherent charateristic of the data and we expect that more data accumulation will evidentially resolve this problem we also show that the representation can search through millions of patients in milliseconds association between ucec cancer_subtypes and histological clinical_features c serous_adenocarcinoma high_grade c other high_grade c endometrioid type high_grade c endometrioid type low_grade only four features are presented and two features with low_frequency are omitted to increase the visibility
