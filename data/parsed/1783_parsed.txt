systems_biology fastpros screening of reaction knockout strategies for metabolic_engineering motivation although constraint based flux analysis of knockout strains has facilitated the production of desirable metabolites in microbes current screening methods have placed a limitation on the number knockouts that can be simultaneously_analyzed results here we propose a novel screening method_named fastpros in this method the potential of a given reaction knockout for production of a specific metabolite is evaluated by shadow pricing of the constraint in the flux_balance which generates a screening score to obtain candidate knockout sets to evaluate the performance of fastpros we screened knockout sets to produce each metabolite in the entire escherichia_coli metabolic_network we found that of these metabolites could be produced under bio mass maximization conditions by adding up to reaction knockouts furthermore we demonstrated that using fastpros in tandem with another screening method optknock could further improve target_metabolite productivity availability_and source_code is freely_available www shimizu ist osaka u ac jp shimizu lab fastpros implemented in matlab and cobra toolbox metabolic_engineering of microbes has been successfully used for the production of a variety of useful compounds in microbes moreover genetic_modification techniques have enabled the disruption and rewiring of metabolic_fluxes to improve the production of target products owing to the complexity of metabolic systems however achieving a desired metabolic_state through genetic_modification remains difficult given that several individual genetic_modifications are often required to improve target productivity the selection of an appropriate set of modifications from a large number of possible combinations is challenging to overcome this obstacle tools based on computer simulation and mathematical_modeling have been developed which make possible screening for appropriate sets of genetic_modifications to improve target productivity flux_balance fba is a widely used method for estimating metabolic_fluxes using genome_scale gsms in fba metabolic_fluxes can be quantitatively estimated by assuming a steady_state metabolic system and optimization of an objective_function maximization of biomass_production flux has been generally adopted as the objective_function and it has been demonstrated that metabolic_fluxes estimated by maximizing biomass_production are in agreement with experimentally_obtained fluxes therefore quantitative flux predictions by fba can accelerate the rational_design of metabolic_networks to improve the yield of target products in silico screening of genetic_modifications is a widely used application of fba for metabolic_engineering and to date several such algorithms have been proposed these algorithms can be classified into two categories comprehensive_screening and iterative screening for example the popular comprehensive knockout screening algorithm optknock which has been used in both academic and industrial settings identifies the reaction knockouts that hold the most promise for achieving the highest target production yield among all possible sets of reaction knockouts however as the calculation time increases exponentially as a function of the number of reaction knockouts that are simultaneously present in the original network the maximum number of reaction knockouts to which this strategy can be applied is limited iterative screening for increasing the target productivity can be carried_out at relatively low computational costs in a simple iterative knockout screening method the effects of all possible single reaction knockouts on metabolic_fluxes are evaluated in the first iteration and the reactions whose knockouts result in the highest_score e g highest production yields under biomass_production maximization are selected in the second iteration in addition to the reaction knockouts selected in the first iteration the effects of additional single reaction knockouts are screened this approach has a drawback however of incompletely searching the knockout combinations for example when target production yields under biomass maximization are used as a score for screening iterative screening fails to identify the combinations of two knockouts that show higher production yields only when they are disrupted simultaneously to overcome this drawback several systematic_screening methods have been developed such as optgene optflux genetic design through local_search gdls and strength pareto evolutionary algorithm for example optgene uses a genetic_algorithm to search the vast solution_space to obtain optimal knockout sets using these approaches sets of reaction knockouts that improve the target production have been successfully identified with relatively small computational costs however if the target production yields are used for the screening score it is often difficult to identify which sets of multiple knockouts cause the target production that occurs only when the knockouts are done simultaneously one possible strategy for this problem is to use a screening score that reflects the potential a knockout has to increase the production yields in concert with other knockouts in the present study we developed a new iterative screening algorithm fast algorithm of knockout screening for target production based on shadow price analysis fastpros which uses biomass_production maximization to identify sets of metabolic_reactions whose simultaneous knockouts result in the production of a target_metabolite in this algorithm we adopted a novel score for iterative knockout screening based on the change in biomass_production flux caused by a slight_increase in the target production flux u target this value corresponds to the shadow price of the constraint of the target metabolite_production flux in the linear_programming problem we demonstrate that u target represents the potential of target production and increasing this value by iterative screening of the reaction knockouts generates sets of knockouts that realize the target production furthermore we show that combining fastpros with another tool optknock provides further improvement of the target production
