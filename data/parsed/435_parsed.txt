gene_expression appex analysis platform for the identification of prognostic gene_expression in cancer because cancer has heterogeneous clinical behaviors due to the progressive accumulation of multiple genetic and epigenetic_alterations the identification of robust molecular_signatures for predicting cancer outcome is profoundly important here we introduce the appex web_based analysis platform as a versatile_tool for identifying prognostic molecular_signatures that predict cancer diversity we incorporated most of statistical_methods for survival analysis and implemented seven survival analysis workflows including coxsingle coxmulti intranssingle intransmulti superpc timeroc and multivariate a total of publicly_available datasets were collected processed and stored to support easy independent_validation of prognostic signatures two case studies including disease_recurrence and bladder cancer_progression were described using different combinations of the seven workflows availability_and appex is freely_available www appex kr the identification of robust molecular_signatures that predict cancer patient outcome is profoundly important because cancers have heterogeneous clinical_courses even if they have similar clinicopathological_characteristics by using prognostic molecular_signatures cancer patients may be treated more effectively for example the oncotype_dx breast_cancer assay is now used in the clinic to predict the clinical behavior of breast_cancer patients various software_tools supporting cancer_genomics studies have been reported most of these studies provide a database platform for searching disease associated genes and target drugs whereas only one system provides a software environment for handling a users own cancer_genomics data with clinical information to determine a significant prognostic signature beyond software toolkits for cancer research many investigators use commercial programs or script language such as spss matlab or r for advanced statistical_analysis however there are few suitable web_based analysis tools that help researchers develop gene_signatures for many oncology investigators doing proper statistical_analyses using publicly_available tools can be a daunting task in addition most genome_wide analysis tools are not equipped with tools for identifying prognostic signatures by survival analysis here we constructed appex a web_based software platform to help researchers in the efforts to identify prognostic signatures from genomics data appex is designed to be easy to use and flexible and it is freely_available for advanced statistical survival_analyses a user_friendly graphical_interface similar to a desktop_application is provided so that users can easily handle their own data on appex even if they are not familiar with statistical_analysis packages in addition appex contains publicly_available datasets directly applicable on the system so that users can easily validate newly_identified signatures in independent patient_cohorts
