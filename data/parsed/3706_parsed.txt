sequence_analysis privar a toolkit for prioritizing snvs and indels from next_generation data next_generation has become a valuable_tool for detecting mutations involved in mendelian_diseases however it is a challenge to identify the small subset of functionally_important mutations from tens_of of rare_variants in a whole exome genome therefore we developed a toolkit called privar a systematic priori tization pipeline that takes into consideration calling quality of the variants their predicted functional impact known connection of the gene to the disease and the number of mutations in a gene and inference from linkage_analysis availability executable jar package is available atnext generation sequencing ngs has become a valuable_tool for discovering potentially causal single_nucleotide snvs as well as short insertions_deletions indels for mendelian_disorders however a large number of rare_variants snvs and indels exist in an individual which poses an unprecedented challenge for pinpointing the causal_mutations not to mention a relatively high false rate in discovering rare snvs indels to aid the process in identifying causal_mutations from large sets of rare_variants we designed a toolkit named privar that provides a comprehensive pipeline for prioritizing coding snvs and indels for further investigation four functional_modules are included in this pipeline variant annotation call quality summary prediction of functional impact for all the variants and candidate_gene identification a quality summary was used to help filter out most of the false_positive variant_calls based on a number of quality_control parameters annotation of the variants provides essential information on them based on several databases the functional prediction module predicts potential functional impact of variants based on evaluation of results from multiple existing algorithms the candidate_gene identification module is designed to consolidate information of linkage_analysis dosage of rare_mutations in a gene known connection of a gene with the disease in question and other relevant_information using the four modules together privar can efficiently reduce the set of potential causal_variants to be considered for further studies
