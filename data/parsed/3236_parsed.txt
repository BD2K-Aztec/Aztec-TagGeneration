genome_analysis network guided regression for detecting associations between dna_methylation and gene_expression motivation high_throughput profiling in biological_research has resulted in the availability of a wealth of data cataloguing the genetic epigenetic and transcriptional states of cells these data could yield discoveries that may lead to breakthroughs in the diagnosis and treatment of human disease but require statistical_methods designed to find the most relevant patterns from millions of potential interactions aberrant_dna is often a feature of cancer and has been proposed as a therapeutic_target however the relationship between dna_methylation and gene_expression remains_poorly results we propose network sparse reduced rank regression nsrrr a multivariate regression_framework capable of using prior_biological expressed as gene_interaction to guide the search for associations between gene_expression and dna methy lation signatures we use simulations to show the advantage of our proposed model in terms of variable_selection accuracy over alternative_models that do not use prior network information we discuss an application of nsrrr to the cancer_genome datasets on primary ovarian tumours availability_and r code implementing the nsrrr model is available at http www widespread_adoption of high_throughput molecular_profiling technology by the biological research_community has resulted in a vast public resource of paired genomic_data where thousands of measurements of different types are available for the same biological_samples this in turn presents the opportunity to develop appropriate statistical_tools to infer relationships between such paired datasets in different biological_contexts here we are particularly interested in identifying associations between paired dna_methylation profiles and expression levels of genes obtained from cancer samples dna_methylation involves addition of a methyl_group to cytosines in dna where this is concentrated in promoter_regions it tends to lead to silencing of expression of the downstream_gene the association between dna_methylation and gene_expression is far from straightforward and dna_methylation has also been shown to be associated with active_transcription of genes aberrant_dna has been observed in almost every type of cancer and patterns of dna_methylation have been linked to changes in gene_expression that associate with the development of drug_resistance obtaining insights into the links between dna_methylation and gene_expression in cancer is expected to be particularly helpful in moving towards addressing the issue of acquired_drug which remains one of the main unmet clinical needs in cancer medicine a number of efforts have been made recently to address the problem of detecting associations between dna_methylation and gene_expression by far the most common scenario involves the mapping of loci with dna_methylation to genes and using some measure of association between the levels of dna_methylation and the levels of expression of the same gene example measures of association include pearsons_correlation and maximal information coefficient in casecontrol designs a common approach consists in first identifying differentially_methylated sites and differentially_expressed traits often using standard two sample univariate statistical_tests e g a t test and then comparing the two resulting lists to detect potential overlaps in this article we take a predictive modelling approach in which we aim to identify a subset of dna_methylation measurements that are highly_predictive of a subset of gene_expression across a set of heterogeneous biological_samples that nonetheless share some characteristic of interest e g patients with the same disease and for which control samples may not be available the precise mechanisms by which dna_methylation influence gene_expression are far from fully understood particularly when it comes to inter_and genic methylation and trans_acting regulation in which the d structure of chromatin enables interactions between nonadjacent regions of the genome a recent study_investigating genome_wide epigenetic and transcriptional changes following acquisition of platinum resistance in ovarian_cancer showed that only a small proportion of genes with an increase in dna_methylation had a corresponding down_regulation of gene_expression for this reason and to identify patterns of regulation where multiple to whom correspondence should be addressed sites of methylation can drive a systematic alteration of a functional expression program akin to a higher eukaryotic equivalent of a bacterial operon we do not wish to restrict our discovery to only those interactions for which each cpg locus is mapped to a gene and directly related to that same genes expression_level instead we would like to be able to identify clear relationships between varying levels of dna_methylation at any loci and corresponding changes in expression of any genes ideally with some relevance to some biological_function the simplest approach to this problem would consist of fitting all possible univariate linear_regression in which each gene_expression value is regressed on each dna methylation_level and all the resulting pairs are ranked based on the magnitude and or statistical_significance of the regression_coefficients we will refer to this method as mass univariate linear modelling mulm such an approach however has two major_drawbacks first because of the large number of hypothesis_tests that are simultaneously carried_out the experiment wide significance_level would be far too stringent second all predictors and responses are modelled as statistically independent while also ignoring any functional relationship between genes to tackle these limitations we present a multivariate regression_model for the simultaneous selection of highly_predictive dna_methylation predictors and the most predictable gene_expression the high_dimensionality and the small_sample pose the challenging problems of coefficient estimation and variable_selection models involving dimension_reduction techniques in conjunction with penalization on the coefficients such as sparse partial_least spls have been explored in related applications including the integrated analysis of paired omics_data l e in this work we adopt a reduced rank regression rrr approach which assumes a linear_association between dna_methylation and gene_expression variables the predictor vectors are projections of the methylation variables matrix into a lower dimensional_space and the response vectors are projections of the gene_expression variables into a lower dimensional_space in light of the complex interactions between nucleic_acids proteins and metabolites in all organisms networks have become fundamental in the understanding of biological_systems in fact these networks appear to underpin biological_processes found throughout living things for instance in a recent methylationgene expression study while validating the findings of top ranking gene_pairs a substantially larger proportion of them were found to be connected in the proteinprotein_interaction ppi_network compared with the expected number from a random_distribution multiple interacting components work together in functional_modules to bring about disease_phenotypes or other traits from a statistical standpoint the utilization of prior information_encoded in biological_networks provides a form of regularization and has been shown to improve inference from highdimensional datasets we seek to improve variable_selection accuracy and the interpretability of our regression_model by guiding variable_selection to highlight sets of comethylated and co expressed genes that are known to co operate in enacting some biological_processes this is achieved by extending our previous work on penalized_regression through the use of an additional penalty function on the regression_coefficients which incorporates prior information regarding the functional relatedness between predictor_variables and between response variables respectively we call the resulting model network sparse reduced rank regression nsrrr when the response variable is univariate incorporating such structural_information to encourage the selection of mutually interacting genes has been shown to give improved variable_selection result in terms of both accuracy and interpretability here we extend this principle to multivariate responses arising when studying genome_wide expression levels an illustration of the nsrrr principle is given in in which trivial networks of predictor_variables and response variables are shown with an example of possible sets of selected_variables highlighted in a darker colour for example if variation in the levels of the darker response variables is explained by variation in the darker predictor_variables they are likely to be selected in the nsrrr model because each set is also connected within its respective network_topology the remainder of the article is organized as follows in section we introduce the nsrrr model the estimation algorithm and a procedure for parameter_tuning in section we report on extensive_simulation set up to explore the properties of the model and compare its performance on alternative_approaches using both artificial and real_datasets in section we present an integrative_analysis of ovarian_cancer data containing genome_wide profiles of both dna_methylation and gene_expressions
