inter_species prediction of protein_phosphorylation in the sbv improver species translation challenge motivation animal_models are widely used in biomedical_research for reasons ranging from practical to ethical an important issue is whether rodent_models are predictive of human_biology this has been addressed recently in the framework of a series of challenges designed by the systems_biology verification for industrial methodology for process verification in research sbv improver initiative in particular one of the sub challenges was devoted to the prediction of protein_phosphorylation responses in human_bronchial exposed to a number of different chemical stimuli given the responses in rat bronchial_epithelial participating teams were asked to make inter_species predictions on the basis of available training examples comprising transcriptomics and phospho proteomics_data results here the two best performing teams present their data_driven approaches and computational_methods in addition post_hoc of the datasets and challenge results were performed by the participants and challenge organizers the challenge outcome indicates that successful prediction of protein_phosphorylation status in human based on rat phosphorylation levels is feasible however within the limitations of the computational_tools used the inclusion of gene_expression data does not improve the prediction quality the post_hoc of time specific measurements sheds light on the signaling_pathways in both species availability_and a detailed_description of the data_set challenge design and outcome is available at www sbvimprover com the code used by team igb is provided under http github com uci igb improver implementations of the algorithms applied by team amg are available atdespite their limitations animal_models play_an in biomedical_research ranging from basic_science to translational_medicine as human testing is severely limited by practical and ethical constraints in the context of drug_development the usefulness of animal_models obviously hinges on the extent to which results can be translated to human_biology as an example we consider here the response of bronchial_epithelial to external chemical stimuli in rat and human on one hand organisms of common_origin should arguably share many of the basic physiological_mechanisms on the other hand different species may exhibit significant differences in the details of their cellular_mechanisms such as signaling_pathways it is therefore essential to study this relationship systematically with the aim to develop reliable tools for the translation of results from animal_models to human_biology recently the systems_biology verification industrial methodology for process verification in research sbvimprover initiative designed and organized the second sbv improver challenge which was devoted to the question of species translation in particular sub challenge discussed in the following concerned the protein_phosphorylation status of normal_human nhbe and normal rat bronchial_epithelial nrbe exposed to the same set of chemical stimuli herein we present and discuss our studies of computational_approaches for the prediction of stimulus specific human protein_phosphorylation levels based on gene_expression and phosphorylation observed in the rat_model in section we first give a brief description of the data and challenge design next the computational_approaches to the prediction task are described after specifying the evaluation criteria applied by the challenge organizers we describe methods used for the post_hoc of datasets and challenge results section_presents the results in terms of the predictions and their evaluation in addition results of the post_hoc concerning modifications of the prediction_models and findings related to the phosphorylation kinetics are presented we conclude with a discussion of the main results and an outlook on potential extensions and future_studies to whom correspondence should be addressed with respect to the predictions required in the sub challenge results summarized inindicate that the naive prediction was already competitive and yielded the best prediction_performance of all individual methods on the other hand the findings demonstrate that the combination of different methods had the effect of improving the test_set performance with respect to some of the criteria in the comparison across the primary methods shown in the ranking of the different choices also confirms that assuming hump ratp yields a decent baseline performance as compared with the nn trained on just phosphorylation data it is also interesting to note that team amgs naive prediction outperformed the lvq method with respect to the test_set b while lvq appeared superior in the training_set validation apparently the relatively small_sample do not allow for more reliable performance_estimates by means of the l o o method the organizers of the challenge compared all the submissions and the details of this analysis are described in like most participants of the sub challenge the two top_ranked teams chose to predict protein activation in human exclusively from the rat phosphorylation data the immediate reaction of the cell in terms of protein_phosphorylation can be expected to be similar however species specific details in the regulation processes may be significant along the complex pathways from phosphorylation to gene_expression levels the use of gene_expression data is further complicated by high_dimension compared with the relatively small number of samples both teams decided to avoid this complexity which combined with measurement noise and unknown thresholds for gene activation may contribute to significant prediction_errors one possible strategy for the inclusion of gene_expression data in the analysis would require several steps from rat phosphorylation levels to rat gene_expression data to human gene_expression to human phosphorylation levels with the possibility of significant and unknown systematic and stochastic errors alternatively as explored by team igb rat gex data could be used as additional input to the prediction model directly results summarized inshow that interestingly a nn trained on p in combination with gene_expression gex performs worse than using rat p as a naive prediction for human p this is not unexpected primarily because of overfitting on the numerous gex features using only a handful of training examples additionally no cross_validation methods were used by team igb to specifically avoid_overfitting and therefore the trained model performs well on the training data but not on the test data for which it performs about as poorly as random and ranks among the worst performing submissions the post_hoc evaluation of time specific rat phosphorylation values as naive predictors for human protein activation at the corresponding time points cf reveals that the agreement is slightly better for the measurement at min this could simply reflect a more pronounced variability in the early_stages of protein activation or that most of the activation happens between and min it is difficult to come to a general conclusion concerning the comparison of signaling_pathways and their kinetics in rat and human closer inspection of the phosphorylation kinetics revealed significant differences between rat and human with respect to the activation patterns but pathways that are activated similarly in the two species could also be identified the differences in regulation of signaling_pathways in these species seem to be stimulus and pathway dependent but can be identified from a well structured training_set as shown by the challenge results
