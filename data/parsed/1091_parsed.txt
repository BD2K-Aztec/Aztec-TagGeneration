data_and comprehensive and relaxed search for oligonucleotide signatures in hierarchically clustered sequence_datasets motivation pcr hybridization dna_sequencing and other important methods in molecular_diagnostics rely on both sequence specific and sequence group specific oligonucleotide_primers and probes their design depends on the identification of oligonucleotide signatures in whole_genome or marker gene sequences although genome and gene databases are generally available and regularly updated collections of valuable signatures are rare even for single requests the search for signatures becomes computationally_expensive when working with large collections of target and non target_sequences moreover with growing dataset sizes the chance of finding exact group matching signatures decreases necessitating the application of relaxed search_methods the resultant substantial increase in complexity is exacerbated by the dearth of algorithms able to solve these problems efficiently results we have developed cassis a fast and scalable method for computing comprehensive collections of sequence and sequence group specific oligonucleotide signatures from large sets of hierarchically clustered nucleic_acid sequence_data based on the arb positional tree pt server and a newly_developed bgrt data_structure cassis not only determines sequence specific signatures and perfect group covering signatures for every node within the cluster i e target groups but also signatures with maximal group coverage sensitivity within a user_defined range of non target hits specificity for groups lacking a perfect common signature an upper_limit of tolerated mismatches within the target group as well as the minimum number of mismatches with non target_sequences can be predefined test runs with one of the largest phylogenetic gene sequence_datasets available indicate good runtime and memory_performance and in silico spot tests have shown the usefulness of the resulting signature sequences as blueprints for group specific_oligonucleotide availability software and supplementary_material are available atoligonucleotide primers and probes are the key diagnostic agents in technologies that allow the rapid sensitive and specific detection of nucleic_acid signatures in samples in fields such as medicine food research and environmental microbiology they are used to identify organisms with specific properties for applications such as microbial_population analysis and molecular screening for microbial_pathogens or indicators there is the additional challenge of detecting and distinguishing organism groups rather than single organisms which can be identified in a number of ways phylogenetically taxonomically etc designing group specific_primers and probes however is a significant challenge as these primers and probes should reliably hybridize with the target_sequences i e have a high coverage within the group but not interact with any non target_sequence that might be in the same sample in many studies conserved housekeeping_genes or gene_products such as ribosomal_rna rrna are targeted considerable collections of probe or signature sequences for suitable target_genes are rare one exception is probebase which provides sequences and annotations of already published rrna targeted oligonucleotide_probes however many of these probes were designed in the past on the basis of small sequence_data collections some of them would have to be reevaluated optimized or even newly_designed to take the relevant rrna gene sequence_data in comprehensive highly curated databases into account the silva ssurrna reference_database contains such a curated collection of annotated nucleic_acid sequence_data which is deeply hierarchically clustered by phylogenetic_relationship this work details a new computational_method for the comprehensive search for sequence and group specific oligonucleotide signatures hereafter simply referred to as signatures our method uses the silva reference_database to create a signature collection that could be used to provide the sequence_information of binding_sites and design templates for valuable phylogenetic primers and probes signature collections could be published alongside the generally available and regularly updated sequence_databases and in combination both could facilitate the design of oligonucleotide_primers and probes there are already several published approaches for searching signature or probe_sequences probesel oligoarray oligowizwe present the results of runtime performance and memory_consumption analyses with respect to each of the stages of cassis furthermore we show data reflecting quantitative and qualitative properties of a comprehensive mer signature collection cassis calculated from the full ssuref
