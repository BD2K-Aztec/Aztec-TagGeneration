a multiple network learning approach to capture system wide condition specific responses motivation condition specific networks capture system wide behavior under varying conditions such as environmental_stresses cell_types or tissues these networks frequently comprise parts that are unique to each condition and parts that are shared among related conditions existing_approaches for learning condition specific networks typically identify either only differences or only similarities across conditions most of these approaches first learn networks per condition independently and then identify similarities and differences in a post learning step such approaches do not exploit the shared_information across conditions during network learning results we describe an approach for learning condition specific networks that identifies the shared and unique subgraphs during network learning simultaneously rather than as a post_processing step our approach learns networks across condition sets shares data from different conditions and produces high_quality networks that capture biologically meaningful_information on simulated_data our approach outperformed an existing approach that learns networks independently for each condition especially for small training_datasets on microarray_data of hundreds of deletion_mutants in two yeast stationary_phase cell_populations the inferred network_structure identified several common and population specific effects of these deletion_mutants and several high_confidence cases of double deletion pairs which can be experimentally tested our results are consistent with and extend the existing knowledge_base of differentiated cell_populations in yeast stationary_phase availability_and c code can be accessed fromall cells on earth have the potential to sense and respond to different extracellular conditions defined by different environmental_stresses growth_factors or cellular differentiation_signals response to different conditions or condition specific response is orchestrated to whom correspondence should be addressed by changes in the concentration of cellular_components mrnas proteins and metabolites as well as the interactions among these components condition specific networks capture the interactions among cellular_components under different conditions providing a system wide view of condition specific behavior understanding these networks can provide_important how organisms function adapt and evolve although technological_advances are allowing us to capture the concentrations of the system components our ability to quantify the condition specific interactions is still limited fortunately network_inference based on probabilistic_graphical that have been used successfully to infer a functional network from one gene_expression mrna concentration dataset provide a starting_point for inferring conditionspecific networks in principle a probabilistic network for each condition could be inferred separately from each condition in practice however such an approach is limited because it fails to recognize an important aspect of condition specific network learning this is a multiple network learning_problem where the networks for each condition are related with both shared and unique subnetworks to extend existing network_inference to infer conditionspecific networks it is important to explicitly capture and exploit the shared_information during network learning in this article we develop a novel approach network_inference with pooling data nipd based on probabilistic_graphical that explicitly incorporates the shared_information across conditions by simultaneously learning multiple high_quality networks across a small number of conditions nipd treats the condition as an additional random variable different values of which induce different network_structures edges in nipd are statistical_dependencies that abstract the true condition specific physical network proteinprotein proteindna_interactions and are inferred from condition specific mrna concentrations modeling the condition variable within the learning framework allows the condition information to directly_influence which edges occur in the final inferred networks and also the condition specific roles of the edges existing network based_approaches for condition specific responses can be grouped into module centric and gene centric approaches module centric approaches identify transcription modules set of transcription factors_regulating a set of target_genes that are coexpressed in a condition specific_manner kimconditions a and b c represents conditions in nipd nipd learns dependencies that are shared between a and b as well as those unique to a or to however these approaches assume identical behavior for all genes within a module and do not provide fine_grained interaction structure that explains the condition specific behavior of individual genes further condition specific patterns are identified via a post learning gene_set gene centric approaches identify the set of condition specific edges on a per gene basis such approaches have been developed for capturing condition specific behavior in diseases in yeast stress_responses and also in different species however these approaches are not probabilistic in nature often rely on the network being known and are restricted to pairwise coexpression relationships rather than general statistical_dependencies most of these approaches infer a network for each condition separately and then compare the networks from different conditions to identify the edges unique or shared across conditions the approach indoes integrate context more directly within a bayesian_network but relies on an initial training_set to learn model_parameters other approaches such as differential dependency networks and mixture of subgraphs construct probabilistic_models but focus on differences rather than both differences and similarities the nipd approach is a gene centric approach with the following benefits i infers general statistical_dependencies including pairwise and higher_order dependencies dependencies among more than two genes ii does not rely on the network being known iii is probabilistic in nature providing a system wide description of the condition specific behavior as a probabilistic network iv simultaneously learns networks across multiple conditions allowing the learning procedure to be informed by the shared_information across conditions and v does not bias the networks toward only differences or similarities thus identifying both conserved and unique aspects of condition specific responses results on simulated_data from known ground_truth networks suggested that networks inferred by nipd were of significantly_higher quality than networks learned separately for each condition results on microarray compendia from two yeast cell_populations quiescent and non quiescent both under glucose stress demonstrated that nipd identified dependencies capturing shared processes respiration that agree with the global starvation stress experienced by these cells as well as populationspecific processes chromatin modeling in quiescent that are consistent with the physiological_state of these cells finally nipd networks were used to extract candidates of double deletion experiments that can lead to insight into this important stage in the life_cycle of yeast and for processes such as cancer and aging the goals of our experiments were as follows i to compare our approach against independent network learning approaches on simulated_data from known ground_truth networks and ii to assess the value of our approach on real microarray_data for i we used two independent learners indep with a markov blanket search algorithm and genenet experiments on simulated_data allowed us to systematically compare the quality of the inferred networks and therefore assess the benefit of pooling data and sharing_information across conditions versus learning networks independently to address ii we applied nipd and indep on microarray_data from two yeast cell_populations isolated from glucose starved stationary_phase cultures these data are good case studies for condition specific network learning hundreds of samples per condition and the inferred quiescent and non quiescent networks can provide potentially new insight into stationary_phase a process known to be intricately related to cancer and aging
