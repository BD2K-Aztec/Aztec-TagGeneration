data_and figure summarizer browser extensions for pubmed central biomedical_scientists need to access figures to validate research facts and to formulate or test novel research hypotheses however figures are difficult to comprehend without associated text e g figure legend and other reference text our evaluation has shown statistically_significant differences in figure comprehension when varying levels of text were provided when the full text article is not available presenting just the figure legend left biomedical_researchers lacking of the information about a figure as compared to having complete figure comprehension adding the title and abstract improved the situation but still left biomedical_researchers missing of the information when the full text article is available figure comprehension increased to the highest the results indicate that there is information in the abstract and in the full text that biomedical_scientists require to understand the figures that appear in biomedical articles on the other hand we also found that the associated text of a figure is typically distributed across the full text body and is frequently redundant in content for example the following three redundant sentences in the abstract introduction and caption describe an image of the article we hypothesize that a succinct and structured summary will allow biomedical_researchers to comprehend the figure data efficiently and to access relevant figures in a timely_manner we first found that biomedical_researchers prefer a structured summary that follows the imrad format introduction methods results and discussion we developed a supervised machine_learning classifier to automatically classify sentences appearing in a full text biomedical articles into the imrad format with an f score of we then developed a simple information_retrieval approach that selects one sentence from each of the imrad categories based on cosine similarity between the sentence and the image caption we generated a manual gold_standard for figures in articles by asking annotators to select sentences from the article that best summarize the figure we then evaluated our figure summarizer using the rouge score recall oriented understudy for gisting evaluation and obtained an average rouge score of in comparison the abstract of the article attained a rouge score of in the future we plan to conduct a cognitive evaluation as we have done in
