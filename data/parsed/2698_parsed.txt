genome_analysis lep map fast and accurate linkage_map construction for large snp datasets motivation current high_throughput allow cost efficient genotyping of millions of single nucleotide polymorph isms snps for hundreds of samples however the tools that are currently available for constructing linkage_maps are not well suited for large_datasets linkage_maps of large_datasets would be helpful in de_novo by facilitating comprehensive genome validation and refinement by enabling chimeric scaffold detection as well as in family based linkage and association studies quantitative_trait mapping analysis of genome synteny and other complex genomic_data analyses results we describe a novel tool called lepidoptera map lep map for constructing accurate linkage_maps with ultradense genome_wide snp data lep map is fast and memory_efficient and largely automated requiring minimal_user it uses simultaneously data on multiple outbred families and can increase linkage_map accuracy by taking_into achiasmatic meiosis a special feature of lepidoptera and some other taxa with no recombination in one sex no recombination in females in lepidoptera we demonstrate that lep map outperforms other methods on real and simulated_data we construct a genome_wide linkage_map of the glanville fritillary butterfly melitaea cinxia with over snps the data were generated with a novel in house solid restriction_site tag sequencing protocol which is described in the online supplementary_material availability_and java source_code under gnu_general with the compiled classes and the datasets are available from http sourceforge net users lep map current high_throughput such as whole_genome and restriction_site rad tag sequencing allow cost efficient detection of millions of snps single_nucleotide and other markers for hundreds of samples linkage_maps constructed from these large_datasets would have significant potential in de_novo especially in the case of the genomes of non model species assembled with short_sequencing linkage_maps can be used to order scaffolds and contigs as well as to validate and refine genomes by detecting chimeric scaffolds however current_tools for constructing linkage_maps are not well suited for large_datasets here we describe a novel tool called lep map lepidoptera map lm to construct linkage_maps for ultradense genome_wide snp datasets apart from their use in genome_assembly genome_wide linkage_maps are valuable in family based linkage and association studies and quantitative_trait mapping by providing increased power and accuracy through multipoint and haplotype_based analyses morever genome_wide linkage_map enables the analysis of genome synteny and other complex genomic_data analyses traditionally linkage_maps are constructed using crosses of inbred_lines however such lines are difficult and expensive to create for many non model species for example the glanville fritillary butterfly melitaea cinxia a well established study system in population ecology has only one generation per year and an obligatory winter diapause lm was developed for the purposes of the glanville fritillary genome_project and was designed to be applied to full sib families crosses of individuals sampled from natural_populations and their offspring the present approach is cost efficient for many non model species other novel features of lm include the following i it is largely automated and requires minimal_user ii it is fast and memory_efficient and produces accurate maps iii it can handle large whole_genome sequencing_datasets iv it can analyze_multiple outbred families as well as typical inbred crosses v it can select necessary parameters based on their significance and vi it can combine genotype data and genome scaffold information in the construction of linkage_maps finally lm vii can take into account achiasmatic meiosis recombination in one sex only a special feature of lepidoptera recombination in males only and some other taxa to correct and impute genotypes we have described a novel tool lep map which can be used to construct accurate linkage_maps for large snp datasets with high rates of noise and missing_values commonly generated by nextgeneration_sequencing lep map outperformed other methods compared in this study in accuracy on real and simulated_data it is light_weight in computation burden and highly automated allowing fast and objective linkage_map construction
