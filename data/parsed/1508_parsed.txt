systems_biology dynamic networks reveal key_players in aging motivation because susceptibility to diseases increases with age studying aging gains importance analyses of gene_expression or sequence_data which have been indispensable for investigating aging have been limited to studying genes and their protein products in isolation ignoring their connectivities however proteins function by interacting with other proteins and this is exactly what biological_networks bns model thus analyzing the proteins bn topologies could contribute to the understanding of aging current methods for analyzing systems level bns deal with their static representations even though cells are dynamic for this reason and because different data types can give complementary biological_insights we integrate current static bns with aging related gene_expression data to construct dynamic age specific bns then we apply sensitive measures of topology to the dynamic bns to study cellular changes with age results while global bn topologies do not significantly change with age local topologies of a number of genes do we predict such genes to be aging related we demonstrate credibility of our predictions by i observing significant_overlap between our predicted aging related genes and ground_truth aging related genes ii observing significant_overlap between functions and diseases that are enriched in our aging related predictions and those that are enriched in ground_truth aging related data iii providing evidence that diseases which are enriched in our aging related predictions are linked to human_aging and iv validating our high_scoring novel predictions in the literature availability_and software executables are available upon request together our results confirm that dynamic ppi network_analysis via integration of static ppi_network data with aging related gene_expression data can reveal meaningful key_players in aging
