sequence_analysis cbrowse a sam bam based contig browser for transcriptome_assembly visualization and analysis to address the impending need for exploring rapidly increased transcriptomics_data generated for non model_organisms we developed cbrowse an ajax based web_browser for visualizing and analyzing transcriptome_assemblies and contigs designed in a standard three tier architecture with a data pre_processing pipeline cbrowse is essentially a rich internet application that offers many seamlessly integrated web interfaces and allows users to navigate sort filter search and visualize data smoothly the pre_processing pipeline takes the contig sequence file in fasta_format and its relevant sam bam_file as the input detects putative polymorphisms simple_sequence and sequencing_errors in contigs and generates image json and database compatible csv text_files that are directly utilized by different web interfaces cbowse is a generic visu_alization and analysis tool that facilitates close examination of assembly_quality genetic_polymorphisms sequence repeats and or sequencing_errors in transcriptome sequencing_projects web_based genome_browsers such as gbrowse and ucsc_genome are widely utilized for visualizing genomes and their sequence_features to facilitate various data analyses that address interesting biological_questions for non model_organisms without sequenced_genomes transcriptome_sequencing is definitely the most efficient way to explore the transcribed portions of genomes and determine their dynamics many bioinformatics programs have been developed improved to address the challenges in transcriptome_assembly especially de_novo without a reference_genome using complementary_dna cdna messenger_rna mrna data from next_generation and sanger_sequencing so_far there is no open_source web_based contig browser yet that allows users to navigate transcript assembly visualize contigs and examine genetic_polymorphisms simple_sequence and sequencing_errors embedded in the assembly to address the impending need for exploring rapidly increased transcriptomics_data for non model_organisms we developed cbrowse contig browser an ajax based web_browser to visualize and analyze transcriptome_assemblies and their individual contigs similar to gbrowse http gmod org wiki gbrowse x map genome projector and jbrowse cbrowse essentially is an ajax based rich internet application that decouples interactions with users from interactions with the server such decoupling empowers web_applications with rich graphic_user gui characteristics such as desktop_application enables a asynchronous clientserver communication and offers faster and smoother user experience by partial updates in web_pages different from these genome_browsers cbrowse is designed for analyzing and visualizing transcriptome_assembly and contigs with unique functionality such as seamlessly integrated data grid viewer alignment viewer and sequence viewer that allow users to navigate sort filter search and visualize transcriptome_data efficiently as an open_source project our web_based cbrowse can be utilized by the research_community to disseminate and release transcriptome_data over the internet
