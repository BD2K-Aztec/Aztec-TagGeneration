cnvoffseq detecting intergenic copy_number using off target exome sequencing_data exome sequencing_technologies have transformed the field of mendelian genetics and allowed for efficient detection of geno mic variants in protein_coding the target enrichment process that is intrinsic to exome_sequencing is inherently imperfect generating large_amounts of unintended off target_sequence off target data are characterized by very low and highly_heterogeneous coverage and are usually discarded by exome analysis_pipelines we posit that off target read_depth is a rich but overlooked source of information that could be mined to detect intergenic copy_number cnv we propose cnvoffseq a novel normalization framework for off target read_depth that is based on local adaptive singular_value svd this method is designed to address the heterogeneity of the underlying data and allows for accurate and precise cnv_detection and genotyping in off target_regions results cnvoffseq was benchmarked on whole_exome samples from the genomes_project in a set of gold_standard intergenic deletions our method achieved a sensitivity of and a specificity of while maintaining a low fdr of for gold_standard deletions longer than kb cnvoffseq achieves a sensitivity of without increasing the fdr cnvoffseq outperforms both whole_genome and whole exome cnv_detection methods considerably and is shown to offer a substantial improvement over na ve local svd availability_and cnvoffseq is available atthe advent of whole_exome wes has led to a renaissance in the field of mendelian genetics wes offers deep coverage for protein_coding at a lower cost than whole_genome wgs and has thus sparked renewed interest in elucidating rare_diseases exome sequence_analysis typically focuses on detecting previously unobserved or very low_frequency coding singlenucleotide polymorphisms snps and small frame_shift indels that are absent from a reference_set this approach is based on the prior hypothesis that such loss_of are more likely to cause severe phenotypic_effects commonly seen in rare_diseases a number of studies have also identified exonic copy_number cnv as the underlying genetic_basis for various mendelian_disorders exome based cnv_detection is complicated by the presence of strong batch_effects introduced by the enrichment process various approaches have been developed to detect genotype and perform association testing on exonic cnvs in population exome datasets the majority of these approaches operate under the assumption that most of the variation in read_depth rd is driven by systematic_bias which swamps the real signal in global noise exome cnv methods attempt to mitigate such bias either through control based normalization or by identifying and removing the strongest components of variation across the population most exome sequencing_technologies rely on a hybridization step to enrich for dna_fragments arising from specific genomic targets hybridization is a sensitive but imperfect process that captures large_amounts of off target fragments along with the intended exonic_regions although hybridization efficiency is highly_variable and platform specific off target_sequence has been consistently shown to comprise as much as of whole exome datasets despite its potential to generate high_quality snp genotypes in non coding_regions non target reads are almost always treated as a contaminant and ignored by exome analysis_pipelines we postulate that off target data are a rich but overlooked source of information that could be mined to detect intergenic cnv the off target sequence_coverage from a wes experiment can range from to we have previously shown that it is possible to accurately identify and genotype cnvs longer than kb from low coverage wgs_data which itself can be as little as coverage despite the similar levels of coverage analysis of off target exome_sequence is confounded by the highly uneven nature of off target_coverage the mechanism behind off target enrichment is highly complex and contingent on both sequence properties and stochastic processes different parts of the genome are subject to distinct biases such that off target rd behaves like a combination of whole_genome and whole exome data and cannot be handled uniformly to address the heterogeneity of off target sequencing_coverage we have developed a dynamic rd normalization pipeline called cnvoffseq the pipeline is based on a modified_version of singular_value svd that allows for flexible region specific noise_reduction and signal_enhancement global or exome wide svd has been established as a robust framework for on target rd normalization and cnv_calling using wes data here we propose a local adaptive svd approach for detection and genotyping of intergenic cnvs based solely on off target reads of wes experiments in principle introns could also be analysed using our framework but we focused to whom correspondence

against chromosome gold_standard deletions for wes samples we excluded cnvs located less than kb from the nearest gene target as well as cnvs overlapping regions that were blacklisted by the encode_project for anomalous rd patterns we also eliminated gold_standard deletions for which none of the samples passed quality_control our cnv_detection resolution is limited by the very low off target_coverage so we only considered events larger than bp the final gold_standard dataset consisted of deleted regions harbouring confident calls across all samples supplementary these deletions range from bp to bp with a median length of bp exome_sequencing is a relatively nascent technology that has nevertheless achieved near ubiquity particularly in the field of mendelian genetics due to its cost and time effectiveness exome_sequencing has largely superseded both wgs and more traditional linkage_studies for investigating rare_genetic furthermore exome_sequencing has proven to be a powerful diagnostic_tool that has revolutionized clinical_genetics by elucidating disorders of unknown genetic aetiology exome_sequencing can inform custom treatment_options thus ushering in a new era of truly personalized_medicine off target data are an integral but overlooked component of exome_sequencing regardless of the underlying technology enrichment strategies attempt to strike a balance between on target stringency and coverage maximization the fortunate side effect of this delicate equilibrium is off target reads which are often regarded as wasteful and dispensable as exome_sequencing is maturing it will continue to generate increasing amounts of offtarget data that represent an unexplored treasure of genomic_information cnvoffseq is the first method to tap into this valuable resource for the purpose of cnv_detection off target enrichment arises through various processes leading to highly_heterogeneous off target_coverage off target read_depth is affected by a mixture of deterministic biases and random noise that require individualized treatment but are difficult to determine a priori as a result off target data pose a significant challenge for cnv_detection that prompted the development of a tailored data_driven normalization approach implemented in cnvoffseq we have demonstrated that our local adaptive svd approach provides a flexible and robust framework for off target read_depth normalization that can enhance true signal while eliminating capture artifacts cnvoffseq clearly outperforms cnv_detection methods that were designed for wgs furthermore it was shown to improve upon both high order and low order singular component filtering thus amounting to more than the sum of its parts cnvoffseq was tested on data from both agilent and nimblegen capture assays but remains platform agnostic like all svd based techniques cnvoffseqs ability to mitigate systematic_bias improves with larger_sample however even in the absence of sufficiently large_datasets cnvoffseq retains some of its de_noising capacity by essentially reverting to loworder singular component filtering finally the modular nature of our pipeline allows for the rd normalization to be separated from the cnv_calling and incorporated into future applications as a pre_processing
