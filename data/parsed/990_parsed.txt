genome_analysis clare cracking the language of regulatory_elements clare is a computational_method designed to reveal sequence encryption of tissue_specific regulatory_elements starting with a set of regulatory_elements known to be active in a particular tissue process it learns the sequence code of the input_set and builds a predictive_model from features specific to those elements the resulting model can then be applied to user supplied genomic_regions to identify novel candidate regulatory_elements clares model also provides a detailed analysis of transcription_factors that most likely bind to the elements making it an invaluable tool for understanding mechanisms of tissue_specific gene_regulation availability clare is freely_accessible at http clare gene_regulatory play a primary role in transcriptional_regulation a process required for the proper execution of various genetic programs proteins called transcription_factors tfs recognize and bind specific regulatory_elements on the dna leading to the activation or repression of a target_gene identification of these regulatory_elements is therefore important for understanding the regulatory mechanisms_involved in the development and functioning of an organism experimental_approaches such as chip_seq or chipchip can help identify regulatory_elements on a genome_wide scale by profiling a tf of interest or a coactivator like p or cbp that colocalizes with active enhancers however these methods are restricted by the number of tfs that can be profiled the efficacy of antibodies experimental_noise and the number of cell_types that can be tested furthermore these methods are usually unable to identify regulatory_regions bound by an unknown tf as a result computational_methods for identifying tf_binding and regulatory_elements are rapidly gaining groundfor a review few tools however are easily_accessible online and convenient for molecular_biologists who are not interested in getting through the hurdles of installing and maintaining software here we present clare cracking the language of regulatory_elements a web_interface to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded as joint first author for the method that we recently_developed to predict regulatory_elements active in a specific tissue or biological_process clare is written in perl and runs on a linux platform our computational_method has been shown to identify mammalian_heart enhancers with validation rates similar to those obtained with chip_seq clare is freely_accessible online at http clare dcode org
