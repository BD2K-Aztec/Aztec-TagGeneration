genetics_and ancgwas a post genome_wide method for interaction pathway and ancestry analysis in homogeneous and admixed_populations motivation despite numerous successful genome_wide gwas detecting variants that have low disease risk still poses a challenge gwas may miss disease genes with weak genetic effects or strong epistatic_effects due to the single marker testing approach commonly used gwas may thus generate false_negative or inconclusive results suggesting the need for novel methods to combine effects of single_nucleotide within a gene to increase the likelihood of fully characterizing the susceptibility_gene results we developed ancgwas an algebraic graph_based centrality measure that accounts for linkage_disequilibrium in identifying significant disease sub networks by integrating the association_signal from gwas data_sets into the human proteinprotein_interaction ppi_network we validated ancgwas using an association study result from a breast_cancer data_set and the simulation of interactive disease_loci in the simulation of a complex admixed population as well as pathway based gwas simulation this new approach holds_promise for deconvoluting the interactions between genes underlying the pathogenesis of complex_diseases results obtained yield a novel central breast_cancer sub network of the human interactome implicated in the proteoglycan synde can mediated signaling_events pathway which is known to play_a in mesenchymal tumor_cell thus providing further insights into breast_cancer pathogenesis availability_and the ancgwas package and documents are available atgenome wide association studies gwas have successfully identified genetic_variants in human populations however many authors have pointed_out that gwas may not detect genetic_variants with low or moderate risk which dont reach the intrinsic genome_wide significance cut_off e today only a few common_variants have been linked to disease and the associated loci explain only a small fraction of the because the effect of a gene_polymorphism may be small gwas may fail to detect a significant signal if the effect of a variant in another gene is not taken into account since complex_diseases are typically caused by multiple factors including multiple genes through genegene_interactions single marker based analysis in gwas may generate false_negative and inconclusive results currently the challenges_facing gwas include i the translation of associated loci into suitable biological_hypotheses ii the well known problem of missing_heritability and iii the understanding of how multiple modestly associated loci within genes interact to influence a phenotype detecting the underlying genetic_etiology of the disease can be difficult as it may involve a single gene or interactions between two or more genes recent_studies that there is a relationship between gene function and phenotype and that functionally_related are more likely to interact alternatively the effect can be at the phenotypic level where a pair of genes can interact to produce a specific phenotype interactions can play_critical the cause of disease therefore standard gwas analysis alone is insufficient to examine the complex genetic_structure of complex_diseases the challenge of genegene_interaction methods is that the large number of multi_locus genotype combinations generated from large_numbers of genetic_variants may leads to the so_called curse of dimensionality problem recently gene_set based_methods have been used to examine gene_sets particularly in the form of biological_pathways or grouping genes by cellular_functions or functional_groups using gwas datasets o these methods search for significantly_enriched gene_sets collected from predefined canonical pathways or functional_annotations such as gene_ontology go terms however these approaches have limitations such as i the requirement for strong disease specific background_knowledge ii the incomplete annotation of pathways or go annotations in the current knowledgebase and iii the results might be limited to a priori_knowledge thus making_it to identify a meaningful combination of genes because risk genes may differ in different individuals but may still lie in the same pathway the proteinprotein_interaction ppi_network based_approach was recently_introduced this approach has been shown to largely overcome some of the limitations in its flexibility in setting the components of a gene_set examining the combined effects of genes by detecting genetic signals beyond single gene_polymorphisms may increase our ability to fully characterize the susceptible genes and unravel the pathogenesis of disease these existing network based_approaches are mostly based on combining p values from standard gwas for correlated snps into an overall significance_level for a gene and combining p values for the genes in a pathway into an overall significance_level to investigate the association of a pathway with the disease however in many cases snps within genes and genes within pathways are correlated and these methods do not account for this dependency but rather assume genes or snps to be independent and uniformly_distributed under a null_hypothesis which may lead to erroneous_results in addition most of these network based_approaches do not account for topological_properties of biological_networks which may lead to meaningless sub networks here we present a method ancgwas that leverages ppi_network information local_ancestry in the case of admixed_populations and linkage_disequilibrium data to mine gwas results ancgwas introduces flexibility in estimating gene and subnetwork specific ancestry using the inferred local_ancestry from ancestry_inference approaches such as in from different simulation_results we demonstrate that ancgwas holds_promise for comprehensively examining the interactions between genes underlying the pathogenesis of genetic_diseases and also underlying ethnic_differences in addition we applied ancgwas to a gwas data_set from postmenopausal_women of european_ancestry with invasive_breast our result yielded an interesting central breast_cancer sub network of the human interactome implicated in the proteoglycan syndecanmediated signaling_events pathway we introduced ancgwas a post gwas method based on an algebraic graph based_approach that leverages the topological_analysis of the ppi_network to i identify hub_genes and use their topological_properties ii identify the most meaningful and significant genes or sub networks relevant to a disease and those underlying ethnic difference in disease risk in the case of admixed_populations and iii account for the correlation that exists between snps within or between genes and genes within pathways ancgwas integrates the association_signal from standard gwas data the local_ancestry for admixed_populations and the snp ld into the human ppi_network in addition ancgwas also handles other user_defined weights such as topological weight ancgwas introduces flexibility in estimating gene and sub network specific ancestry using the inferred local_ancestry from ancestry_inference approaches such as in when ruling out the gene and sub networkspecific ancestry the proposed method corrects for possible bias in the inferred local ancestries obtained from current approaches of local_ancestry in addition it tests for casecontrol unusual difference in ancestry at the gene and sub network level using the corrected local_ancestry of admixed_populations we have done types of simulation to test ancgwas i causal simulation with some causal_snps on a way admixed population to test if ancgwas can recover the gwas signal and ancestry differences ii null simulation without disease snps on a way admixed population to test if ancgwas produces a false signal or type_i and iii pathway based simulation with weak disease effect to test ancgwass ability to recover interactive disease genes within a pathway all simulated_data are available with the ancgwas package at http www cbio uct ac za ancgwas our results from the causal simulation of a way admixed population and the data_set of invasive_breast demonstrated that ancgwas can recover weak and moderate association_signals from standard gwas results by leveraging effects of all snps within a gene and sub network to unravel signals of possible disease associated genes or pathways further discussion in supplementary text s although our statistical_methods account for false discovery we assessed the ability of ancgwas to control both type i and ii errors based on null simulation with no causal loci and causal simulation of disease_loci in the simulation of an admixed population respectively in these assessments no false_positive negative signals were identified supplementary tables s and s moreover ancgwas can detect ancestry differences in admixed data as shown in which displays candidate ancestry difference at the gene sub network level however our current method cannot perform allelic tests of association directly from the data controlling for differences in gene sub network specific ancestry candidate peaks as this is very challenging due to genegene_interactions or considering sub networks of iterative genes this would mean a large number of multi_locus genotype combinations generated from large_numbers of genetic_variants leading to the so_called curse of dimensionality problem inferring accurate local_ancestry is also challenging and currently we do not have access to a phenotypic data_set of an admixed population otherwise it would be interesting to apply the proposed approach to such a population to evaluate the performance of this approach in identifying the pathways associated with a disease the lack of accurate_knowledge of complex_traits and the incomplete human protein_interaction makes it challenging to directly compare the results from different pathway analysis methods nevertheless we used a gwas data_set of invasive_breast supplementary text s to compare ancgwas to dmgwas these results have shown that ancgwas identified more cancer associated genes in its results than dmgwas and holds_promise for deconvoluting the interactions between genes underlying the pathogenesis of complex_diseases dmgwas recently released a new feature that uses gene_expression for edge_weights however because the new dmgwas still uses the same greedy searching algorithm to break down the biological_network into sub networks it still doesnt take advantage of the topological_properties of biological_networks like ancgwas does
