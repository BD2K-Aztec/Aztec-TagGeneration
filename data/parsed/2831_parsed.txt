mdd soh exploiting maximal dependence decomposition to identify s sulfenylation sites with substrate motifs s sulfenylation s sulphenylation or sulfenic_acid the covalent_attachment of s hydroxyl soh to cysteine thiol plays_a in redox_regulation of protein functions although sulfenic_acid is transient and labile most of its physiological_activities occur under control of s hydroxyl ation therefore discriminating the substrate site of s sulfenylated proteins is an essential task in computational_biology for the furtherance of protein_structures and functions research into s sul fenylated protein is currently very limited and no dedicated tools are available for the computational_identification of soh sites given a total of experimentally_verified s sulfenylated proteins from humans this study carries out a bioinformatics investigation on soh sites based on amino_acid and solvent_accessible a twosamplelogo indicates that the positively and negatively_charged amino_acids flanking the soh sites may impact the formulation of s sulfenylation in closed three_dimensional environments in addition the substrate motifs of soh sites are studied using the maximal dependence decomposition mdd based on the concept of binary_classification between soh and non soh sites support_vector svm is applied to learn the predictive_model from mdd identified substrate motifs according to the evaluation results of fold_cross the integrated svm model learned from substrate motifs yields an average_accuracy of significantly improving the prediction of soh sites furthermore the integrated svm model also effectively improves the predictive_performance in an independent testing_set finally the integrated svm model is applied to implement an effective web_resource named mdd soh to identify soh sites with their corresponding substrate motifs availability_and the mdd soh is now freely_available to all interested users atprotein s sulfenylation also known as s sulphenylation is a reversible post translation modification ptm involving covalent_attachment of hydroxide to the thiol group of cysteine_residues oxidation of the thiol functional_group in cysteine cysso h has emerged over the last decade as an important method of controlling protein functions through both physiologic and oxidative stress_conditions more than sulfenic modifications have been identified from transcription_factors signaling proteins metabolic_enzymes proteostasis regulators and cytoskeletal_components due to the labile nature and low_abundance of in vivo s sulfenylation the detail characteristics and mechanisms of s sulfenylation still need to be clarified to our knowledge the protein database of human mouse or rat only consists of cysteine_residues both the degree of ssulfenylation within proteins and quantification of protein sulfenic modification are necessary for understanding oxidative ptm regulation several chemo proteomic strategies exist for identifying ssulfenylated sites with various clickable probes but these are very expensive in the laboratory the lack of the information about sites and the multiplicity of redox changes both lead to false_positive identifications as for the increasing number of experimentally_identified ssulfenylated peptides building a resource database is essential for further biological investigation of s sulfenylated proteins and the substrate_specificities of s sulfenylation sites with the development of powerful bioinformatics technologies these approaches are adopted for prognostication of individual cysteine_residues to ssulfenylation although several published algorithms and public servers are available to analyze and predict the reactive state of cysteine and oxidative yet disulfide cysteine no unconfirmed bio reports exist on the specific information of s sulfenylated targets and substrate sites except for chemical approaches with over s sulfenylation sites on proteins in intact cells other potential novel consensus s sulfenylation motifs and substrate site specificities remain_unclear this work concentrates on identifying s sulfenylation sites with potential substrate motifs depending on the in silico characterization of protein the sequential and structural_features including amino_acid aac amino_acid pair composition aapc position_specific pssm position_weight pwm amino_acid matrix blosum and accessible_surface asa are applied to discriminate between the soh sites and non soh sites additionally this study proposes an iteratively statistical_method for recognizing s sulfenylation sites and promising consensus motifs by maximal dependence decomposition mdd based on the most significant dependencies between positions mdd allows a large group of aligned sequence to be separated into subgroups containing characteristic motifs for each subgroup support_vector svm was adopted to build the predictive_model for each mdd cluster consequently the ability to predict results between s sulfenylation sites and non s sulfenylation sites is significantly_increased through evaluation of fold_cross furthermore an independent testing_set which is blind to the training_dataset was generated from the experimental_data of published database to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models in the evaluation of fold_cross to facilitate the study of protein s sulfenylation the mdd identified substrate motifs were employed to implement a web_based resource for identifying s sulfenylation sites with their corresponding substrate motifs this study identified the s sulfenylation sites of proteins and investigated the statistically_significant conserved_motifs through twosamplelogo the analysis of position specific amino_acids composition between s sulfenylation and non s sulfenylation site identified the relationship between flanking amino_acids with the s sulfenylation cysteine site moreover this investigation also found that the solvent accessible surface of amino_acid surrounding s sulfenylation sites have a tendency to higher than that aroundexploiting mdd to identify s sulfenylation sitesnon s sulfenylation sites based on the results of fold_cross the hybrid feature of blosum and pssm was estimated as the best feature with the highest proportion of sensitivity specificity accuracy and mcc as stated previously the main purpose is to find the conserved_motifs of s sulfenylation sites based on the amino_acid by using mddlogo all s sulfenylation proteins were clustered into subgroups corresponding with conserved_motifs the mdd identified motif can thus be adopted to train the model to enhance significantly the predictive_performance of the ssulfenylation site the sets were evaluated through independent testing using two models namely mddlogo clustered svm and single svm without mdd as expected mddlogo clustered svm model which contained the significant conserved_motifs achieved the better performance consequently this model was employed to set up a novel web_based resource named mdd soh to identify s sulfenylation sites and their corresponding substrate motifs
