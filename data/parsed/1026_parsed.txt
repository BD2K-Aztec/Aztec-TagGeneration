genetics_and coala an r framework for coalescent_simulation simulation programs based on the coalescent efficiently generate genetic data according to a given model of evolution we present coala an r package for calling coalescent simulators with a unified syntax it can execute simulations with several programs calculate additional summary_statistics and combine multiple simulations to create biologically more realistic data availability_and the package is publicly_available on cran and on https github com statgenlmu coala under the conditions of the mit_license coalescent simulators rapidly simulate the evolution of genetic_sequences they are routinely used in population_genetics to approximate analytically intractable quantities to verify theoretical_predictions and to validate the performance of data analysis methods the underlying idea to trace the ancestry of the sequences backwards in time was first implemented in the program ms since then the size and complexity of data_sets has increased and many extensions and modifications of the original algorithm were proposed to cope with the new challenges for example the program mshot supports recombination_hotspots macs fastsimcoal and scrm focus on the efficient_simulation of long_sequences and msms and cosi account for selection the total number of published simulators is more extensive andcreated an online database to help researchers select an appropriate program currently these simulators lack standardized in and output_formats and usually only support the calculation of a small number of summary_statistics to calculate additional statistics researchers usually have to convert the simulated_data into different formats this process is error_prone and even small mistakes can lead to wrong conclusions or irreproducible results to simplify this process we present coala an r package for calling coalescent simulators from within r it provides a unified interface for specifying coalescent models in r r core automatically selects a suitable simulator transparently conducts the simulations parses the results and calculates additional statistics from the output we have created an r package that simplifies the simulation of data according to evolutionary_models it allows researchers to conduct and process coalescent simulations in an easy reliable and reproducible way different simulators can be called using a unified r syntax and a variety of summary_statistics can be calculated from the results we hope that coala will facilitate the use of more realistic models by allowing for variable mutation and recombination_rates and finite sites mutation models although might not always be necessary to use sophisticated simulation_models the easy availability of these features facilitates testing whether they are important for a particular application
