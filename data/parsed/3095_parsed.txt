sequence_analysis mpbind a meta motif based statistical_framework and pipeline to predict binding_potential of selex derived aptamers aptamers are synthetic antibodies that can bind to target_molecules with high_affinity and specificity aptamers are chemically_synthesized and their discovery can be performed completely in vitro rather than relying on in vivo biological_processes making them well suited for high_throughput discovery however a large fraction of the most enriched aptamers in systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment selex rounds display poor binding activity here we present mpbind a meta motif based statistical_framework and pipeline to predict the binding_potential of selex derived apta mers using human_embryonic selex seq data mpbind achieved high_prediction for binding_potential further analysis showed that mpbind is robust to both polymerase_chain amplification_bias and incomplete sequencing of aptamer pools these two biases usually confound aptamer analysis availability_and mpbind software and documents are available at http www morgridge net mpbind html the human_embryonic whole cell selex seq data are available ataptamers are short single stranted dna or rna which have the ability to specifically bind to a variety of targets including proteins and the surface of cells aptamers have gained significant interest as a promising alternative to antibodies because they are chemically_synthesized thermostable and can be readily produced using standard laboratory_techniques importantly aptamers can be distributed as sequence_information rather than as a physical entity the generation of high_affinity aptamers typically starts with a random oligonucleotide pool these oligonucleotides are then subjected to multiple rounds of in vitro target based selection with polymerase_chain pcr_amplification this procedure is termed selex systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment several studies observed that the number of unique_sequences decreases after target_selection suggesting that the decrease of sequence complexity is caused by the increase of sequence enrichment also trueselected sequences were more likely to appear in multiple rounds if compared with non selected sequences thus enrichment ratio related methods are the most common approach to initially identify high_affinity aptamers however those methods suffer from a relatively high false_positive where sequences are enriched but do not exhibit binding this is likely because of pcr amplification_bias to design aptamers that can bind to human_embryonic hescs we generated five rounds of hesc whole cell selex sequencing_data we found that the validation rate is low if we used the enrichment ratio based method data not shown prior work showed that pcr bias is a substantial confounding_factor in aptamer analysis therefore there is a pressing need to have a computational_approach that can accurately_predict the binding_potential of selex derived aptamers without relying on aptamer read_counts to this end we developed mpbind a novel statistical_framework and pipeline to predict the binding_potential of selexderived aptamers our approach is based on the assumption that the binding_potential of an aptamer can be broken down to the combination of binding of all n mers e g mer within a sequence mpbind assesses all possible n mers for metrics such as the relative frequency change and the relative_abundance in the final round based on those observations each n mer is assigned a combined score the binding_potential of an aptamer is further inferred from the combination of all n mers within the sequence this approach integrates multiple moderately informative sources of data to generate high_confidence predictions which is particularly important for cell selex where non specific binding is prevalent we generated five rounds of whole cell selex sequencing_data using hescs the initial library r contains m reads with unique reads pcr_amplification by its nature generates redundant sequences therefore if the sequencing_depth is deep enough to cover all copies of reads in a pool we should observe a drop in read complexity even without any selection or pcr bias the read complexity in this scenario indicates the overall redundancy in a pool supplementary a however if read_depth is far less than all reads in a pool as is typically the case for selex experiments then the pcr cycles will not affect read complexity supplementary b this is because if there is no target_selection and no pcr bias pcr cycles will not change the relative_abundance of each read species and also because the sequencing_depth is low compared with the number of available species most species are sampled just once or not at all low read complexity then is likely indicative of some species being preferentially sampled if a pool contains a fraction of favored sequences by target_selection or via pcr bias with limited sampling depth those favored sequences are repeatedly sampled and make the read complexity lower supplementary c to investigate the extent of incomplete sequencing in our pool we compared the reads that overlap between sequencing runs in initial pool r and control seq r the overlapping is minimal and only six reads are present in both sequencing runs supplementary d it indicates that our sequencing read_depth is far from enough to cover all the reads in a pool incomplete sequencing of oligonucleotide pools is common in selex seq this is because for a typical selex seq the initial library pool requires at least to complexity to achieve the necessary diversity our hescs selex aptamers are nt in length and thus the number of all possible sequences in the initial library pool is in theory although the real number of sequences in the pool is likely to be much less than that it is still far beyond the sequencing_depth after one round of selection the percentage of unique reads dropped to to investigate whether this drop in read complexity is a result of enrichment through true binding or pcr bias we sequenced pools without target_selection but with the same number of pcr cycles control seq our sequencing_depth for our libraries was typically sequences supplementary as shown in supplementary table s the percentage of non redundant reads in control seq r dropped to this drop in read complexity in the controlseq is likely due to pcr bias and likely indicates pcr bias in the selex seq as well for example as shown in supplementary table s the top three enriched reads in the control seq are ranked number in terms of enrichment in the selex seq it indicates that those enriched reads in selex seq are more likely due to being selected by pcr pcr bias in selex seq has been previously observed to avoid pcr bias we removed redundant reads from each round to train mpbind with parameter n mer the training_set includes initial library r selex seq r r r r and r and controlseq r to evaluate the performance of mpbind we selected aptamers with a large_dynamic in their meta z_score to we further defined binding as a notable shift of fluorescence_intensity of cells bound by fluorescently_labeled aptamer compared with controls see supplementaryfor details the area_under auc of the receiver_operating roc_curve of mpbind is as expected if we included redundant reads from each round to train mpbind the auc drops to as shown in the spearmans rank correlation rho between the predicted meta z_score mpbind and the binding_potential binding_assay is supplementary b aptamer supplementary is ranked as the top enriched aptamer in the final selex round reads the binding_assay showed that this aptamer did not bind to hescs mpbind successfully predicts this to be a non binding aptamer meta z_score it is likely that the enrichment of aptamer is caused by pcr bias this aptamer is also enriched in control seq r with copies however the enrichment of this aptamer in control seq is not as high as in selex seq indicating that the extent of pcr bias can also be stochastic this type of bias was also suggested by with the evidence that increasing copy_number in selex seq did not necessarily display increasing binding_affinity aptamer does not have sufficient read_counts to support it as a high_affinity aptamer no reads from r to r and only four reads in r however mpbind predicted this to be outperformed than that trained on redundant reads auc the motif length is set to nt a high_affinity aptamer meta z_score the binding_assay confirmed that this aptamer strongly binds to h cells supplementary a and supplementary interestingly this indicates that mpbind can correctly predict aptamer affinity even in the lack of read_counts information e g incomplete sequencing of oligonucleotide pools in other words mpbind is capable of achieving de_novo predictions after sufficient training to examine how each individual statistic contributes to the prediction_performance we used z z z and z separately to predict aptamer binding_potential as shown in supplementary table s the aucs of z z z and z ranged from to lower than when four z scores are combined auc thus integrating_multiple sources of information generates more confident predictions to further investigate the impact of motif length on the prediction_performance we varied the motif length from to nt as shown in supplementary mers achieved the best prediction_performance to further evaluate the performance of mpbind we tested it on another selex seq dataset esrp dittmar et_al generated five rounds of selex seq esrp data r r r r and r for each round we merged reads to unique reads removed redundant reads and trained mpbind with parameter n mer this indicates that mpbind can correctly predict aptamers that bind to esrp in summary we show that mpbind is a useful tool for predicting binding aptamers from selex seq data and is robust to biases caused by pcr or by incomplete sequencing of aptamer pools however we should also note that the premise of mpbind is that the binding_potential of an aptamer is dictated by the combination of n mers this assumption is valid for the two datasets we tested hescs whole cell selex seq and esrp protein selex seq however this might not be true for all selex seq data in the future we will further evaluate mpbind and continue to update it to be effective with a variety of selex seq datasets
