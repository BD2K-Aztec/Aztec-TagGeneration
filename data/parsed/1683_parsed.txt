sequence_analysis exome_sequencing based copy_number and loss_of detection exomecnv motivation the ability to detect copy_number cnv and loss_of loh from exome_sequencing extends the utility of this powerful approach that has mainly been used for point or small insertion_deletion detection results we present exomecnv a statistical_method to detect cnv and loh using depth of coverage and b allele_frequencies from mapped short_sequence and we assess both the methods power and the effects of confounding_variables we apply our method to a cancer exome resequencing dataset as expected accuracy and resolution are dependent on depth of coverage and capture probe design availability cran package exomecnv contact the development of next_generation has enabled routine large_scale resequencing projects permitting us to perform increasingly more comprehensive dna variant analysis however the cost and analytical complexity of sequencing still limit the number of whole genomes that can be sequenced in any single project in fact the analysis of complete human_genome often interprets dna alterations in protein_coding primarily this is in practice a reasonable strategy since of the disease_causing are found in the coding_regions or canonical splice_sites thus wholeexome sequencing presents an effective alternative to whole_genome and provides an unbiased cost_effective and timeefficient tool for the study of the genetic_basis for disease following the first successful application of whole_exome in rediscovering the cause of a dominantly_inherited rare mendelian disorder freemansheldon syndrome a number to whom correspondence should be addressed of studies have reported similar successes although the cost of both genome and exome_sequencing continues to fall at a rapid pace whole_exome has a number of advantages including a lower cost more straightforward data analysis and interpretation and significantly greater_depth of coverage with a corresponding overall improvement in data_quality exome_sequencing is rapidly becoming a fundamental tool for genetic and functional genomic research_laboratories and a diagnostic_tool in clinics at present the main applications of targeted exonic sequencing is for the determination of single_nucleotide snvs or small indel variants but not structural_variation structural_variation especially copy_number cnv and loss_of loh is an important class of genetic_variability in mendelian common inherited_diseases and cancer as is true of snvs there are population specific common cnvs and rare disease_causing cnvs many large_scale projects and technological platforms have been devised to estimate the prevalence and impact of cnv array_comparative cgh and snp_genotyping have been widely used as standard methods to detect cnv and loh however with the rapid increase in genomic and exomic sequence there is growing interest in the use of these data to detect_cnvs while methods have been developed for cnv estimation in whole_genome these methods make key assumptions that fail to hold in the exome_sequencing setting for example assumes random unbiased distribution of sequence_reads such that read_depth can be modeled as a normal distribution across the genome and deviation from the background indicates the presence of cnv this random read_distribution assumption breaks down in the context of exome_capture as the probes have variable specificity and efficiency for the targeted exonic_regions the discrete nature of exome sequences also presents problems toexisting methods many whole_genome cnv detection_tools use segmentation_algorithms that assume continuity of search_space and do not function properly when given discontinuous and variable_length exome_sequencing segseq for example merges windows of a fixed_length based on a log_ratio difference statistic lastly because exons are generally smaller than insert_sizes for paired_end bp paired_end based cnv_detection methods are not generally_applicable to exome data here we present exomecnv which uses depth of coverage and b allele_frequencies from mapped short_sequence to estimate cnv left side and loh right side we describe an assessment of its validity sensitivity specificity and limitations through an analysis of a melanoma tumor and a matched normal sample important model assumption and the effect of important confounding_factor such as sample admixture rate are also considered
