systems_biology efficient statistical_significance approximation for local_similarity analysis of high_throughput time series data motivation local_similarity analysis of biological time series data helps elucidate the varying dynamics of biological_systems however its applications to large_scale high_throughput data are limited by slow permutation procedures for statistical_significance evaluation results we developed a theoretical_approach to approximate the statistical_significance of local_similarity analysis based on the approximate tail distribution of the maximum partial sum of independent identically distributed i i d random_variables simulations show that the derived formula approximates the tail distribution reasonably well starting at time points with no delay and with delay and provides p values comparable with those from permutations the new approach_enables efficient calculation of statistical_significance for pairwise local_similarity analysis making possible all to all local association studies otherwise prohibitive as a demonstration local_similarity analysis of human_microbiome time series shows that core operational_taxonomic otus are highly synergetic and some of the associations are body site_specific across samples availability the new approach is implemented in our elsa package which now provides pipelines for faster local_similarity analysis of time series data the tool is freely_available from elsas website http meta usc edu softs lsa understanding how genes regulate each other and when the regulations are active is an important problem in molecular biological_research similarly in ecological_studies it is important to understand how different organisms and environmental_factors such as food_resources temperature etc regulate each other to affect the whole community for generality we will refer to either genes in gene_regulation studies or organisms or environmental_factors in ecological_studies as factors time series data can give significant insights about the regulatory_relationships among different factors many computational or statistical_approaches have been developed to cluster the genes into different groups so that the expression_profiles of genes in each cluster are highly_correlated most of these methods consider the correlation of expression_patterns across the entire time interval of interest for many gene_regulation relationships the regulation may be active in certain subintervals methods based on the global associations of the gene_expression may fail to detect these relationships several local association based_methods have been developed to address this problem borrowing the idea from local_alignment for molecular sequences proposed to identify local and potential time delayed lagged associations between gene_expression here local indicates the two factors are only associated within some time subinterval and time delayed indicates there is time shift in the associated profiles the strength of local association is measured by local_similarity ls score and the statistical_significance of ls score is evaluated by a large number of permutations the authors showed that such analysis can identify associated pairs that are not detectable through global analysis used a similar approach to study local associations of microbial organisms in the ocean over a year period and this approach has been used in several other recent ecological_studies recently extended the approach to deal with replicated time series where not only statistical_significance of ls score can be evaluated but also a bootstrap confidence_interval can be obtained one of the major limitations of the local_similarity analysis is the time consuming permutation procedure used to evaluate the statistical_significance p value of the ls score when a large number of g genes are considered gg gene_pairs need to be evaluated for a type_i in order to adjust for multiple testing the bonferroni_corrected threshold is gg for g the threshold is when which will need over permutations that are computationally prohibitive although in practice false_discovery q value is used to correct for the multiple comparison problem still thousands of to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as permutations are needed for estimating p values that were used for q value calculation a fast and efficient theoretical approximation for the statistical_significance of the ls score is urgently_needed recently provided an upper_bound for the p value corresponding to a ls score however the upper_bound is not tight we make the following contributions in this article first feller developed an approximation theory for the range of partial sums for independent identically distributed i i d random_variables with mean zero andextended the results to markovian random_variables although the theory developed by feller was later further extended by others it has not been applied to the field of computational_biology we are the first to use fellers theory to approximate the distribution of ls scores on the other hand the theory corresponding to the scenario that the expectation of each random variable is negative was used byand karlin and altschul to derive the statistical_significance for local sequence_alignment such a development was crucial for the wide use of blast in computational biological_research second the theory by feller and others are valid only when the number of summands time points is large however it is not clear how large the number of time points should be so that the approximation is reasonable for the ls score we show through simulations that the approximation from feller is reasonable as long as the number of time points is at least for ls score without time delay in addition we show how we can adapt fellers approximation to calculate statistical_significance of ls score with time delays simulations showed that the resulting approximation is appropriate when the number of time points is above finally we applied the developed theory to the analysis of real_datasets from gene_expression to metagenomics communities where interesting biological results were obtained the organization of the article is as follows in the methods section we provide the theoretical bases for deriving the approximate tail probability that the ls score is above a threshold in the results section we use simulations to study the number of data_points n needed for the theoretical approximation to be valid we also use the theoretical formula to study three real_datasets arising from different high_throughput experiments microarray molecular finger printing and ngs tag sequencing the article_concludes with some discussion on further applications and future_research
