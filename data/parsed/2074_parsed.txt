genetics_and glogs a fast and powerful method for gwas of binary_traits with risk covariates in related populations mixed model based_approaches to genome_wide gwas of binary_traits in related individuals can account for non genetic risk_factors in an integrated manner however they are technically_challenging glogs genome_wide logistic mixed model score test addresses such challenges with efficient statistical_procedures and a parallel implementation glogs has high power relative to alternative_approaches as risk covariate_effects increase and can complete a gwas in minutes availability source_code are provided atalthough many genome_wide gwas are of unrelated populations and do not include the effects of nongenetic predictors it is also of interest to study populations with family structures or cryptic relatedness while incorporating the effects of covariates mixed model based_methods represent traits as a function of observed covariates and unknown random_effects and are attractive for such problems because these effects are addressed in a direct and integrated manner in such methods the mean of the trait is affected by the observed covariates and the genetic_marker being tested whereas the random_effects influence the traits variance and correlation_structure early implementations of the mixed model approach for quantitative_traits include solar more recently improvements in the efficiency of statistical_methods computing_power and software engineering have made the approach feasible for analyses of quantitative_traits using genome_wide data as systems such as tassel and emmax illustrate given these successes further development of mixed model methods for gwas is desirable especially for binary_traits in this article we describe genome_wide logistic mixed model score test glogs a mixed model based system for gwas of binary_traits in populations with related individuals glogs performs a gwas by estimating parameters of a logistic risk model based on non genetic covariates and a polygenic effect and to whom correspondence should be addressed evaluating associations between markers and the disease using score tests simulation_studies demonstrate that this approach yields comparatively_high statistical_power especially as covariate_effects on risk increase additionally glogs achieves a high degree of computational tractability through parallelization glogs can complete gwas in minutes allowing investigations of a variety of possible covariates to be conducted in a timely_manner in this article we addressed mixed model based gwas of binary_traits in populations of related individuals where risk is affected by non genetic_factors our approach glogs calculates maximum_likelihood parameter_estimates for a logistic mixed model and then uses score tests to evaluate associations we note that alternatives exist for both of these steps our use of maximum_likelihood is motivated by our use of the score test which is based on maximum_likelihood under the null_model glogs improves upon other methods for gwas of binary_traits in related populations by offering direct support for risk covariates in a system that is also powerful for studies that omit such covariates this is demonstrated in which suggests that glogs is roughly as powerful as the mqls package when risk covariates have little effect and more powerful for analyses with larger covariate_effects this is expected as both methods are based on score tests and mqls does not offer direct covariate support additionally glogs offers fast run times due to its use of the score test and parallelization of parameter_estimation procedure typically the total time required to perform a gwas with glogs is primarily based on parameter_estimation which is done once per analysis with run time inversely proportional to the number of processors used score testing is comparatively fast in score tests were performed in of the time of the parameter_estimation step increasing the number of markers fold would yield an increased run time of in contrast for mqls and the methods discussed in a fold increase in the number of markers would result in approximately a fold increase in run time consistent with other methods run times for glogs increase with the number of individuals studied we have used glogs in gwas of over highly related individuals and markers controlling for multiple binary integer and continuous risk covariates such analyses take min to perform with the computer hardware used in our simulation_studies a current version of glogs is provided at http www bioinformatics org stanhope glogs
