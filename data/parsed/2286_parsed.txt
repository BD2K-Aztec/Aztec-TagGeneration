gene_expression identification of context specific gene_regulatory with gemula gene_expression modeling using lasso motivation gene_regulatory in which edges between nodes describe interactions between transcriptional_regulators and their target_genes determine the coordinated spatiotemporal expression of genes especially in higher organisms context specific combinatorial regulation by transcription_factors tfs is believed to determine cellular_states and fates tftarget gene interactions can be studied using high_throughput techniques such as chip_chip or chip_seq these experiments are time and cost intensive and further limited by for instance availability of high_affinity tf antibodies hence there is a practical need for methods that can predict tftf and tftarget gene interactions in silico i e from gene_expression and dna sequence_data alone we propose gemula a novel approach based on linear_models to predict tfgene expression associations and tftf interactions from experimental_data gemula is based on linear_models fast and considers a wide_range of biologically_plausible models that describe gene_expression data as a function of predicted tf_binding to gene_promoters results we show that models inferred with gemula are able to explain roughly of the observed variation in gene_expression in the yeast heat_shock the functional_relevance of the inferred tftf interactions in these models are validated by different sources of independent experimental_evidence we also have applied gemula to an in vitro model of neuronal outgrowth our findings confirm existing knowledge on gene regulatory_interactions underlying neuronal outgrowth but importantly also generate new insights into the temporal_dynamics of this gene_regulatory that can now be addressed experimentally availability the gemula r package is available from http www few vu nl degunst gemula tar gz cell_type and condition specific interactions between transcriptional_regulators and their target_genes are a primary mechanism to whom correspondence should be addressed for cells to accomplish spatiotemporal changes in gene_expression identification of such interactions is an important step in modeling transcriptional_regulatory regression_methods are valuable tools that can be used to address three important issues in gene_regulatory building first they allow identification of transcription_factors tfs and synergistic_interactions between tfs that determine observed variation in gene_expression when two tfs commonly regulate a set of target_genes the synergistic_effect of the tfs on target gene_expression may not be just simply the sum of the individual effects by fitting regression_models that contain interaction_terms that represent synergy between tfs and comparing these to simpler models without such interactions regulatory_interactions between tfs can be inferred second regression_models provide answers to the question of how much of the observed variation in a single gene_expression condition of interest can be predicted or explained based on regulatory_motifs occurring in gene_promoters since transcriptional gene_regulation is time dependent it is of interest to get some quantitative measure of how much of the observed variation in a specific biological_context can be attributed to tf_activity finally regression_models can provide insight into spatially_and dynamic interactions between tfs and target_genes by comparing models inferred from the sets of genes regulated at successive time points and or under different experimental_conditions pioneering work on constructing linear_regression for gene_expression analysis was performed bysubsequently suggested a non parametric regression_approach that uses multivariate adaptive regression splines they demonstrated the importance of generating and selecting among competing candidate models in a systematic way in order to model interactions between synergistic tfs model_selection however is a major_challenge in gene_expression analysis given the large number of potential model terms when interactions between predictors are considered the number of possible candidate predictor terms p is relatively large compared with the sample_size n typically p n or even p n to select and fit models that appropriately trade_off bias and variance and that do not suffer from substantial overfit is not easy in this context if we assume that only a small subset of the candidate predictors s p is really associated to the response of interest we can restrict ourselves to sparse models by considering penalized regression_methods such as the lasso statistical_methods that generate sparse models have already successfully been appliedpage the success of a regression based_approach to modeling gene_expression and dna sequence_data depends on appropriate choices for the type of model and the predictors used as input this was first demonstrated bywho proposed a strategy that uses the non parametric mars method as core regression routine claim that their marsmotif algorithm which allows modeling of synergistic_interactions between predictors is approximately to times more accurate than the method of which is based on a linear_model the comparison is based on an r like statistic and no cross_validation was performed a comprehensive comparison is lacking the results we present in this article show that similar synergistic_interactions as in can be modeled using linear_models in fact gemula produces biologically_plausible models with superior fit compared with mars when applied to the same data typically models contain a rather large number of predictors whereas not all of these are equally relevant for the underlying biological_processes we demonstrate that gemula identifies synergistic pairs of tfs that are likely to be functionally_relevant i e on average the overlap in target_genes of such identified tftf pairs is significantly_higher than expected by chance in order to build models that are biologically useful and interpretable the availability of relevant_biological predictors used as input are crucial the trap predictors we consider in this article represent in silico predicted binding_affinities of tfs using yeast data we showed that gemula in combination with trap predictors successfully identifies interactions between known heat_shock regulating tfs such as msn msn hsf cst and rox that underlie the observed variation in expression of yeast genes in response to hypothermic shock the trap predictors are realvalued and have an interpretation that is closer to experimentally_measured tfdna binding_profiles as obtained for instance with chip_chip assays than other motif representations which use exact words models that use trap predictors have a clear page columns correspond to models fitted for the early responsive_genes and columns to models for the late responsive_genes the column n p lists the number of predictors in the fitted gemula models and n t denotes the number of model terms r cv is the goodness_of criterion of the selected model section together with a bootstrap confidence_interval interpretation which facilitates the step toward biological_validation our analysis of yeast stress_response gene_expression data shows that gemula can identify context specific tftf interactions that underly observed variation in gene_expression under different physiological_conditions we demonstrate that our method can also be used to analyze mammalian gene_expression data we applied gemula to identify tfs associated to observed variations in early_and gene_expression changes in f cells in response to forskolin stimulation the observed fit in terms of r cv of the resulting models is considerably less than for gemula models inferred from yeast heat_shock data where additional predictors are available however we show that gemula identifies several crucial tfs with a well established role in the regulation of neuronal outgrowthassociated gene_expression and additionally provides new insights into the temporal_dynamics of the regulatory_network underlying axon_growth the strength of our approach is the combination of l penalization and re sampling methods to fit and select appropriately regularized models a current limitation is that the linear_models we discuss in this article are not capable of quantifying contributions of tfs to variation in gene_expression across experiments to extend the penalized regression_framework to the multivariate case of multiple experiments would require fitting a model that includes parameters representing tf_activity in each condition separately see e g resulting in a computationally more complex problem how to induce the right amount of sparsity and solve the corresponding optimization_problem would be an interesting direction for further research linear_models are valuable tools for inference of transcriptional gene regulatory_interactions and synergistic pairwise interactions between predictors that underlie observed changes in gene_expression under
