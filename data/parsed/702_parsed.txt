genome_analysis bedops high performance genomic feature operations the large and growing number of genome_wide datasets highlights the need for high performance feature analysis and data comparison methods in addition to efficient data storage and retrieval techniques we introduce bedops a software_suite for common genomic analysis tasks which offers improved flexibility scalability and execution time characteristics over previously_published packages the suite includes a utility to compress large inputs into a lossless format that can provide greater space savings and faster data extractions than alternatives experimental genomic_data and subsequent analysis results are frequently stored in variations of the browser_extensible bed format many bed analyses require set like operations using genomic_coordinates others require nearest element associations between feature_sets and quantitative calculations across related genomic_segments simple examples_include selecting transcription_factor base_pairs away from any gene identifying the closest transcriptional_start for every putative replication origin and computing the average exon expression value per gene the bedops tool suite addresses these and other typical analysis questions the suite operates efficiently in memory with bed inputs of any size and number in sharp_contrast to the bedtools and feature rich galaxy packages compressing a large file can save valuable disk_space and facilitate data transfers typically at the expense of data access performance bedops offers high_quality bed compression into a format that actually reduces access times to the vast_majority of data relative to any sequential processing approach to whom correspondence should be addressed the first three authors contributed equally computing overlap and proximity relationships between datasets is fundamental to many genomic_analyses working with large_datasets complicates computations and necessitates scalable solutions the bedops suite facilitates common analysis tasks and functions efficiently with inputs of arbitrary size the suite also includes efficient data storage and retrieval techniques to help manage and query sizable datasets
