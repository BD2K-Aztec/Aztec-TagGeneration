data_and drug_drug extraction from biomedical_literature using syntax convolutional_neural motivation detecting drug_drug ddi has become a vital part of public_health safety therefore using text_mining techniques to extract ddis from biomedical_literature has received great attentions however this research is still at an early_stage and its performance has much room to improve results in this article we present a syntax convolutional_neural scnn based ddi_extraction method in this method a novel word embedding syntax word embedding is proposed to employ the syntactic information of a sentence then the position and part of speech features are introduced to extend the embedding of each word later auto encoder is introduced to encode the traditional bag of words feature sparse vector as the dense real value vector finally a combination of embedding based convolutional features and traditional features are fed to the softmax classifier to extract ddis from biomedical_literature experimental_results on the ddiextraction corpus show that scnn obtains a better performance an f score of than other state of the art methods availability_and the source_code is available for academic use at http ddi scnn ddi zip adverse_drug adrs lead to deaths per year in the usa and europe drug_drug ddi which is broadly described as a change in the effect of one drug by the presence of another drug is an important subset of adrs landau reported that about million people in usa aged faced potentially_dangerous drug_combinations as a result detecting ddis has become a vital part of public_health safety with rich ddis knowledge the patients can be prevented from taking two or more drugs simultaneously which will cause harmful interactions currently some drug related databases like drugbank and stockleys drug_interactions have been created to help detect ddis however since the volume of biomedical_literature is growing rapidly a large number of valuable ddis remain hidden in the unstructured biomedical texts thus the automatic extraction of ddis information from biomedical_literature has become an important research area in recent_years ddiextraction and challenges have been held successfully ddiextraction only focuses on the identification of all possible ddis while the challenge requires in addition to ddi detection the classification of each ddi i e the ddis need to be classified into four predefined ddi types advice effect int and mechanism advice is assigned when a recommendation or advice regarding concomitant use of two drugs involved is described effect is assigned when the effect of the ddi is described int is assigned when a ddi appears in the text without any additional information provided mechanism is assigned when a ddi is described by its pharmacokinetic mechanism existing ddi_extraction methods can be roughly divided_into two categories the one stage and two stage methods the one stage method accomplishes ddi detection and classification simultaneously by training a multiclass svm it directly classifies each candidate instance into one of the five ddi types advice effect int mechanism and negative for the negative instances the two stage method divides the learning_problem into two stages first all the ddis are detected and second the detected ddis are classified into one of the four specific ddi types advice effect int and mechanism in ddiextraction challenge fbk irst team used a twostage method it employs a hybrid kernel to detect ddis and then assign them to one of the four ddi types by training four separate_models one against all respectively the method achieves an f score of which ranks top in the challenge later also proposed a two stage method based on linear svm using rich features and obtained a higher f score of on the same corpus the method uses the word feature word pair feature parse tree feature and noun phraseconstrained coordination feature in addition its one against one multiclass classification strategy also contributes greatly to its performance while the other methods choose one against all strategy an example of the one stage method is the one presented by uturku team in ddiextraction challenge it accomplishes ddi detection and classification tasks simultaneously by training a multiclass svm and classifies each candidate instance into one of the five ddi types advice effect int mechanism and negative the method achieves the third best performance an f score of in ddiextraction challenge although many methods have been proposed ddi_extraction research is still at an early_stage and its performance has much room to improve for example in ddiextraction challenge the best performance achieved is in f score in addition the state of the art ddi_extraction methods are all feature engineering based ones i e they need to design effective features elaborately using various nlp tools and knowledge resources which is still a labor_intensive and skill dependent task therefore the performance of these methods is heavily dependent on the choice of features finally since ddiextraction challenge is a multiclass classification_problem a multiclass classifier is needed however most methods with top performance train several binary svms to solve the multiclass classification_problem in fact k or k k here k is the number of target classes binary classifiers are needed when oneagainst all or one against one strategies are chosen respectively although such methods can achieve better performances they increase the complexity of the ddi_extraction to solve these problems we propose a syntax convolutional_neural scnn based ddi_extraction method the method uses a novel word embedding word embedding is a parameterized function that maps words to high_dimensional vectors and was first introduced byto fight the curse of dimensionality in the process of learning language model using neural_network the syntax word embedding to introduce the syntactic information of a sentence which has proven to be helpful in boosting the performance of relation extraction then the syntax word embedding is extended by the position feature and the part of speech pos feature to introduce the position and pos information the latter is first introduced in our method to capture the pos information of each word later auto encoder is introduced to transfer the traditional sparse features to the dense real value features before they are combined with the embedding based convolutional features finally the combined features are passed to the softmax to learn the ddi classifier
