data_and genereporter sequence_based document retrieval and annotation genereporter is a web_tool that reports functional information and relevant_literature on a protein coding_sequence of interest its purpose is to support both manual genome_annotation and document retrieval pubmed references corresponding to a sequence are detected by the extraction of query words from uniprot entries of homologous_sequences data on protein_families domains potential cofactors structure function cellular_localization metabolic contribution and corresponding dna_binding complement the information on a given gene_product of interest availability_and genereporter is available at http www genereporter tu bs de the web_site integrates databases and analysis tools as soap based web_services from the ebi in face of next_generation and high_throughput analyses the link between obtained data and existing knowledge is crucial automatic annotation_pipelines provide useful evidence of potential functions for genes and proteins but in a last essential step the scientist must manually evaluate the available information usually the necessary evidence is derived from scientific_publications databases and in silico predictions thus tools that provide a combination of all of these relevant data for a gene or protein of interest are of high practical impact in this context genereporter offers a customizable workflow for the integrated application of protein sequence_analysis and document retrieval a large number of diverse text_mining tools exist that provide different strategies and interfaces to satisfy the extensive datamining demands in biomedical_sciences genereporter identifies citations related to a gene or protein_sequence of interest the uniprot annotations of homologous_sequences are used to derive keywords such as gene names synonyms and species these keywords provide the query terms for a subsequent literature_search in pubmed in to whom correspondence should be addressed this way genereporter extends and replaces mineblast a similar tool which is discontinued in comparison with other tools that connect literature to sequence_information like quicklit and metis genereporter is characterized by highly customizable query options the integration of interpro and the direct access to the original ebi and ncbi databases the results are summarized on an overview page for each query_sequence this page provides a link to a detailed view of the obtained data for the requested services the result overview page can be bookmarked and results can be retrieved from this url for at least h for further analysis results can be downloaded as excel or tab_delimited text_files the detailed view provides one result tab for each requested service the blast result tab shows homologous protein_sequences it is complemented with annotations from the uniprot database e g organism name and go terms in order to facilitate their evaluation the pubmed result tab shows gene related citations ordered by the respective pubmed queries query words that were matched within title and abstract are marked in bold for each query word combination the link this query in pubmed performs the corresponding query on the pubmed web_site this allows the manual modification and specification of the automatically generated queries with all the sophisticated features of the pubmed_search interface furthermore genereporter provides citations from uniprot entries of the blast hit sequences in general these references comprise the key papers on the respective gene or protein shows the pubmed tab of an example search for a hypothetical protein from pseudomonas_aeruginosa c the output from interpro phobius and predisi requests is given in additional tabs the interproscan and phobius output includes graphical visualizations of signature matches and transmembrane_regions within the proteins of interest
