structural_bioinformatics ligand_binding using ligand interacting and binding_site enriched protein triangles motivation knowledge about the site at which a ligand binds provides an important clue for predicting the function of a protein and is also often a prerequisite for performing docking computations in virtual drug_design and screening we have previously shown that certain ligand interacting triangles of protein atoms called protein triangles tend to occur more frequently at ligand_binding than at other parts of the protein results in this work we describe a new ligand_binding method that was developed based on binding_site enriched protein triangles the new method was tested on benchmark_datasets and on targets from two recent community_based studies of such predictions and excellent results were obtained where comparisons were made the success_rates for the new method for the first predicted site were significantly better than methods that are not a meta predictor further examination showed that for most of the unsuccessful predictions the pocket of the ligand_binding was identified but not the site itself whereas for some others the failure was not due to the method itself but due to the use of an incorrect biological unit in the structure examined although using correct biological units would not necessarily improve the prediction success_rates these results suggest that the new method is a valuable new addition to a suite of existing structure based bioinformatics_tools for studies of molecular_recognition and related functions of proteins in post genomics research availability the executable binaries and a web_server for our method are available from http sourceforge net_projects msdock and http lise ibms the number of sequences and structures of protein of unknown function is increasing rapidly as a result of genome research these proteins can usually be assigned a putative_function if their ligand_binding can be predicted as such ligand_binding lbsp is now a competition category in critical to whom correspondence should be addressed assessment of protein_structure casp experiments lbsp is also often the starting_point for protein ligand_docking the core methodology for virtual_screening in drug_design and development ligands usually bind at specific sites of target_proteins and it is therefore generally believed that ligand_binding can be distinguished from other parts of the protein surface by certain specific features for example the electrostatic_potential and size of a cavity formed on the protein surface many lbsp algorithms based on this line of thinking have been proposed in the past_decade generally the main difference between these algorithms is whether they perform geometric computations to identify cavities i e binding_site pockets on the protein surface many methods that compute binding_site pockets also known as geometry based_methods have been developed based on the assumption that a ligand always binds in the largest cavity in its target protein this is of course not correct but is a reasonable starting_point and the assumption has been shown to be correct of the time in an analysis of a set of known proteinligand complex structures however how to precisely identify empty spaces i e cavities on the protein surface and determine their size is not trivial as different cavity computing algorithms do not always give the same result for the same protein_structure to avoid relying on the inherently incorrect assumption that the largest cavity is the binding_site a different type of method searches for energetically favored regions for ligand_binding using energy calculations to do so these energy based_methods distribute probes usually a sphere representing a small_molecule or a chemical group with a particular function e g hydrophobicity around the target protein and calculate the interaction_energy between the probes and the protein atoms with which they are in contact probes with favorable interaction_energies are then clustered and the most energetically favored region is identified and predicted to be the ligand_binding as these methods do not aim at identifying the largest cavity they are more likely to succeed where geometry based_methods often fail e g in cases in which the ligand binds in a shallow cavity on the protein surface on the other hand energy calculations may miss the largest cavity and they are more expensive to compute and may require a sophisticated clustering scheme furthermore in lbsp applications the ligand molecule is usually not known and it is difficult to devise a probe system that can simulate a variety of chemical_properties to cover the large possible number of unknown ligands as more and more protein_structures are deposited in the pdb homology based_methods in which one finds structures resembling that of the target protein and predicts the ligand_binding by inferring homology through structural_alignments have become viable these can be more reliable than other methods but require the availability of homologous structures with known ligand_binding another strategy that can be applied thanks to the increase in structure data is to statistically identify features that may have been evolutionarily imprinted in ligand_binding such methods are propensity based_methods for example found that the amino_acid at ligand_binding is significantly different from that at non binding_site protein_surfaces and that the difference between the two could be used to rescore the binding_site pockets reported by others to improve the success_rates of lbsp as these different strategies have different strengths_and methods such as fpocket that combine different strategies show potential to perform better than single strategy methods indeed using consensus of results of other methods i e performing metapredictions metapocket mpk reports the best lbsp success_rates to date finally residue conservation is a critical property for increasing the success_rate of lbsp and is commonly incorporated in lbsp methods in this study we developed a novel algorithm for predicting proteins ligand_binding this is an extension of our previous work in which we developed a novel docking score function motifscore based on network_motifs of d proteinligand contacts i e interactions during the derivation of motifscore we observed that some of the d protein ligand interaction_motifs contributed much more significantly to motifscore than others and that their three constituent protein atoms which form a triangle on the protein surface were often seen together i e were concomitantly enriched at the ligand_binding this new lbsp method was named lise on the basis that these protein triangles are ligand i nteracting and binding_site enriched benchmark predictions using the same set of structural data and the same evaluation criteria showed that in cases where comparisons were made lise outperformed other methods on the whole often with a significantly better accuracy for the first predicted site i e top prediction furthermore in a prediction for recent casp_targets with a full ligand molecule as opposed to an ion or small solvent molecule lise correctly_identified as the top site a level of accuracy similar to that achieved for the benchmark predictions suggesting that lise can be an accurate and reliable lbsp tool in helping to annotate proteins of unknown function
