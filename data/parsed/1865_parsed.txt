structural_bioinformatics fold em automated fold_recognition in medium and low_resolution a electron_density motivation owing to the size and complexity of large multi component biological assemblies the most tractable approach to determining their atomic_structure is often to fit high_resolution radio graphic or nuclear_magnetic structures of isolated components into lower_resolution electron_density of the larger assembly obtained using cryo_electron cryo_em this hybrid_approach to structure_determination requires that an atomic_resolution structure of each component or a suitable homolog is available if neither is available then the amount of structural_information regarding that component is limited by the resolution of the cryo_em map however even if a suitable homolog cannot be identified using sequence_analysis a search for structural homologs should still be performed because structural_homology often persists throughout evolution even when sequence_homology is undetectable as macromolecules can often be described as a collection of independently folded domains one way of searching for structural homo logs would be to systematically fit representative domain structures from a protein domain database into the medium low_resolution cryo_em map and return the best fits taken together the best fitting non overlapping structures would constitute a mosaic backbone model of the assembly that could aid map interpretation and illuminate biological_function result using the computational principles of the scale invariant feature transform sift we have developed fold ema computational_tool that can identify folded macromolecular domains in medium to low_resolution a electron_density and return a model of the constituent polypeptides in a fully_automated fashion as a by product fold em can also do flexible multi domain fitting that may provide insight into conformational changes that occur in macromolecular assemblies recent_technological have resulted in exponential_growth of the amount of data available at each level of the sequencestructurefunction relationship along with this expansion of available data comes the need for systematic and objective methods for its analysis and interpretation for example the amount of information that can be extracted from the structure of an isolated macromolecule is limited to fully understand how a macromolecule functions in a cell requires knowledge of not only its interaction_partners but also how mutually induced conformational changes that occur upon complex formation give rise to integrated biological_function toward this end structural_biology continues to tackle larger and larger targets ranging from radiographic structures of binary protein_complexes to cryo_em image reconstructions of large macromolecular_complexes and cryo_electron tomograms of entire cells unfortunately cryo elecron microscopy tomography cryo_em et maps typically have low signal_to making their analysis and interpretation challenging and somewhat subjective depending on the skill of specialized investigators hence there is a need for computational_methods to systematically and quantitatively analyze maps of macromolecular assemblies organelles and whole cells in particular tools capable of i identifying individual proteins within larger complexes and ii characterizing conformational_rearrangements relevant to macromolecular function would provide nonstructural specialists access to structural data thus allowing for enhanced biological perspectives we recently reported the development of a new computational_tool motif em that solves a critical structural_comparison problem p in a fully_automated fashion p is defined as follows compare a non atomic_resolution structure e g a cryo_em map with another structure either another map or an atomic_resolution structure and identify_conserved structural_domains motifs or structurally equivalent sub volumes between the input pair motif em solves p supplementary and thus detects conserved sub structures in a pair of structures by using a novel algorithm inspired by a recent breakthrough in d object_recognition the scale invariant feature transform or sift because of its unmatched effectiveness in carrying out feature_detection adaptations of sift are being used in a wide_range of scientific applications including tracking of robots d scene object modeling recognition tracking human action recognition to whom correspondence should be addressed and human_brain analysis in d magnetic_resonance and so forth based on the feature recognition principles used in motifem we have now created a new software_tool fold em to automatically identify macromolecular folds in electron_density and to characterize conformational changes that accompany different biological_states of macromolecules fold em systematically searches an input electron_density of a macromolecular assembly for sub volumes that are structurally homologous to one or more protein_domains present in the scop protein database by recursively repeating this procedure a modular_structure incorporating all the fitted domains is returned thus providing a preliminary c backbone model of the macromolecular assembly under investigation similarly using our approach it is possible to automatically_determine if different transformations are necessary for fitting different regions when comparing a multi domain structure to an input electron_density of a macromolecule that can adopt different conformations as a result sift based feature_detection is inherently capable of performing flexible multi domain fitting and characterizing conformational_differences between the structures being compared our program assumes no a priori_knowledge of the type or relative orientation of macromolecular folds present in the input electron_density and thus provides a fully_automated means of analyzing electron_density of macromolecules and their assemblies although the program was developed for the analysis of medium to low_resolution electron_density maps_obtained via cryo_em it should work equally well if not better with higher_resolution electron_density such as those obtained by x_ray here we i discuss the computational challenges that needed to be overcome to develop fold em ii demonstrate the effectiveness of fold em in carrying out flexible multi domain and large_scale fittings using synthetic and real_data and iii consider some advantages of fold em compared with existing softwares that fit atomic_resolution structures into medium to low_resolution electron_density inspired by sifts broad_applicability and driven by the current need in structural_biology to effectively and efficiently interpret structures from electron_microscopy we have developed a new software_tool fold em to automatically and systematically identify protein_folds and fit atomic_resolution macromolecular structures into cryo_em electron_density without any prior_knowledge fold em is based on motif emour previous adaptation of the sift algorithm for interpretation of cryo_em maps we have adapted and extended the motif em_algorithm to automatically identify folds and characterize conformational changes in cryo electron_density of large macromolecular assemblies the underlying algorithm in motif em and fold em works by constructing rotationally invariant low_dimensional representations of local_regions in the input atomic_resolution structures and cryo_em maps correspondences are established between the reduced representations by comparing them using a simple metric these correspondences are then clustered using hash tables and graph_theory to identify structurally equivalent domains or motifs the motivation to develop fold em from motif em came from the recognition that the sift based comparison module buildsrigid body docker fitter section partial matching yes situs

direx mdff flex em etc require users to provide appropriate starting conformations as they are based on local_search backbone modeller section level of automation fold em is fully_automated ematch freds not fully_automated for instance freds required approximate domain region segmentation details section last paragraph backbone modeller section dependency none ematch freds depend on availability of third_party modules such as helix detectors fitters etc details section last paragraph a given row x refers to a method in fold em row x column lists the name of the method row x column lists one of its critical distinguishing property row x column elaborates that property for that fold em method and row x column elaborates that property for existing competing_methods for instance row refers to the method rigid_body docker row column in fold em row column lists the particular property partial matching of in question row column states the existence of that property in the fold em docker row column states the non existence of that property in any other existing docker that we are aware of correspondences by matching smaller structural_units and hence the algorithm should work even if only portions of the structures being compared are homologous thus the method is well suited for building backbone models of large complex macromolecular assemblies by systematically fitting smaller independent domain structures into a cryo_em map of the larger assembly fold em accomplishes this task by recursively fitting representative domain structures from the scop structural database into the input cryo_em map and returning the best fitting non overlapping structures fold em succeeds at least partially because it is inherently capable of carrying out partial matching unlike other fitting software the fold em fitting module is not affected by extraneous structure in either the target map or the search structure similarly fold em will also automatically_determine if different transformations are necessary for fitting different regions of the input search model as a result fold em is inherently able to characterize conformational_differences due to inter domain motions partial resemblances between the structures being compared using fold em we have demonstrated its effectiveness in i partial matching i e successful docking fitting in the presence of extraneous protein residues ii fitting multi domain structures into cryo_em maps in a single step while taking_into flexibility due to inter domain motions and iii performing fully_automated large_scale fold_recognition and fitting using a protein domain database the ability to automatically and objectively carry out these challenging tasks allows non specialists to perform sophisticated structural analysis and sets fold em apart from other existing docking packages
