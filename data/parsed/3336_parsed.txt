genome_analysis onlinecall fast online parameter_estimation and base_calling for illumina's next_generation motivation next_generation platforms are becoming increasingly cost_effective and capable of providing enormous_number of reads in a relatively short time however their accuracy and read_lengths are still lagging behind those of conventional sanger_sequencing method performance of next_generation is fundamentally limited by various imperfections in the sequencing by synthesis and signal acquisition processes this drives the search for accurate scalable and computationally_tractable base_calling algorithms capable of accounting for such imperfections results relying on a statistical_model of the sequencing by synthesis process and signal acquisition procedure we develop a computationally_efficient base_calling method for illuminas sequencing_technology specifically genome_analyzer ii platform parameters of the model are estimated via a fast unsupervised online learning scheme which uses the generalized expectation_maximization and requires only s of running time per tile on an intel i machine ghz single core a three orders_of speed up over existing parametric model based_methods to minimize the latency between the end of the sequencing run and the generation of the base_calling reports we develop a fast online scalable decoding algorithm which requires only s tile and achieves significantly_lower error_rates than the illuminas base_calling software moreover it is demonstrated that the proposed online parameter_estimation scheme efficiently computes tile dependent parameters which can thereafter be provided to the base_calling algorithm resulting in significant improvements over previously_developed base_calling methods for the considered platform in terms of performance time complexity and latency recent development of next_generation has enabled cost_effective whole_genome and resequencing reinvigorated transcriptomics and has provided an essential tool for research in functional and comparative_genomics epigenetics to whom correspondence should be addressed and metagenomics however before the promised benefits of widespread applications of dna_sequencing come to fruition sequencing_technology requires further improvements although next_generation systems are cost_effective and capable of providing very high number of reads in a relatively short time their accuracy and read_lengths are still lagging behind those of conventional sanger_sequencing method in this article we focus on illuminas sequencing_platform and relying on a mathematical_model of sequencing bysynthesis propose a fast online algorithm for unsupervised_learning of the parameters of the model and a computationally_efficient technique for sequential base_calling the model captures the different sources of uncertainty in the sequencing_process and signal acquisition procedure illuminas current base_calling software bustard is very fast but its performance leaves a lot of room for improvement consequently several novel base_calling methods for illuminas sequencing_platform have been proposed in recent_years developed an approach referred to as alta cyclic which relies on a supervised training stage using a rich dna_library with a known reference_genome on a control lane to find parameters of a model and uses support_vector for optimal basecalling proposed model_based and information_theoretic ideas for basecalling the developed method referred to as rolexa uses a gaussian_mixture for classification and uses filters which cut_off bases reads with quality_scores that are below a certain threshold proposed ibis which uses a machine_learning scheme similar to alta cyclic and relies on base specific parameters and multiclass support_vector with polynomial kernels for acceleration of the algorithm recently proposed a bayesian inference_method for base_calling in particular this approach relies on a batch expectationmaximization algorithm to infer parameters of a detailed mathematical_model of sequencing by synthesis on illuminas platform and applies the markov_chain technique to perform base_calling the approach named bayescall was shown to significantly improve base_calling error_rates over state of the art techniques however the approach turned out to be computationally_demanding and therefore infeasible for basecalling millions of reads obtained from illuminas sequencing_platforms the follow_up article by the same authors presents naivebayescall a simplified heuristic which runs significantly_faster than bayescall at the cost of small to moderate deterioration of the error_rate performance the basecalling method we propose onlinecall relies on a mathematical_model that is a simplified_version of the model used by bayescall and naivebayescall parameters of the proposed model can be inferred in a computationally_efficient manner the illumina flowcell has lanes each lane having tiles performance of onlinecall is verified on a full lane data obtained by sequencing phix embl ncbi accession_number j bacteriophage using illuminas genome_analyzer ii generating reads of length after basecalling the lane by bustard naivebayescall rolexa ibis and onlinecall the calls were mapped onto the known reference_sequence comprising bases the optimal alignment which relies on computing the hamming_distance is found the hamming_distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different any read that maps with of erroneously called bases is retained while reads having more erroneously called bases are removed to ensure that there is no ambiguity in the alignment this results in approximately million_reads and million bases which are used to compare the performance of the considered basecalling schemes average error_rates over the lane comprising tiles are compared in compares the per tile error_rates of five basecalling schemes bustard naivebayescall rolexa ibis and onlinecall for the first tiles onlinecalls tile dependent parameter_estimation strategy enables significant reduction of error_rates as compared to other schemes for the remaining tiles performance of onlinecall is very close to that of naivebayescall shows the dependence of basecalling error_rates on cycle number onlinecall and naivebayescall have similar performance and are increasingly better than bustard for cycles beyond the th one is a plot of the discrimination_ability of the five basecalling schemes up to an error_rate bustards quality_scores are the best after which onlinecall has the most reliable quality_scores in this article we proposed a novel model and developed a fast online parameter_estimation and base_calling scheme for illuminas next generation sequencers the error_rates and discrimination_ability of the proposed method are better than those of the existing competing schemes at the same time the proposed method is three orders_of than some of the recently_proposed competing schemes and is practically feasible we demonstrated positive impact of the developed method on downstream applications in particular extended lengths of the contigs in sequence_assembly improved base_calling will enable performance advancements of genome and transcriptome_assembly as well as genotype snp_calling as a part of our future work we will investigate the impact of read by read parameter_estimation and base_calling on the overall platform performance studies of intertile and intratile parameter variations presented in the current article are a useful starting_point we also intend to investigate the information content metric in more details and explore fundamental relationships between quality_scores error_rates and read base rejection
