inferring models of multiscale copy_number evolution for single tumor phylogenetics motivation phylogenetic algorithms have begun to see widespread use in cancer research to reconstruct processes of evolution in tumor_progression developing reliable phylogenies for tumor data requires quantitative_models of cancer evolution that include the unusual genetic mechanisms by which tumors evolve such as chromosome_abnormalities and allow for heterogeneity between tumor_types and individual patients previous work on inferring phylogenies of single tumors by copy_number evolution assumed models of uniform rates of genomic gain and loss across different genomic_sites and scales a substantial oversimplification necessitated by a lack of algorithms and quantitative_parameters for fitting to more realistic tumor evolution models results we propose a framework for inferring models of tumor_progression from single_cell gene_copy data including variable rates for different gain_and we propose a new algorithm for identification of most parsimonious combinations of single gene and single chromosome events we extend it via dynamic_programming to include genome duplications we implement an expectation_maximization em like method to estimate mutation specific and tumor specific event_rates concurrently with tree reconstruction application of our algorithms to real cervical_cancer data identifies key genomic_events in disease_progression consistent with prior literature classification experiments on cervical and tongue_cancer datasets lead to improved prediction_accuracy for the metastasis of primary cervical_cancers and for tongue_cancer survival availability_and our software fishtrees and two datasets are available at ftp ftp ncbi nlm nih gov pub fishtrees tumor_development are evolutionary_processes and it has become ever more apparent that evolution is fundamental to public_health in cancer treatment such as the failure of therapy due to drug_resistance the evolutionary nature of cancers prompted the observation that one might reconstruct cancer_progression processes using methods from phylogenetics i e evolutionary tree building cancer phylogenetics was initially applied at the level of populations of cancers by modeling individual aberrations individual tumors or tumor_types as species later variants were developed to study evolution of single tumors at the regional or cellular levels phylogenetic_models have proven valuable for distinguishing driver_genes from passengers in tumor genomic_data explaining intra tumor v c the author published_by
