cellcode a robust latent_variable approach to differential_expression for heterogeneous_cell motivation identifying alterations in gene_expression associated with different clinical states is important for the study of human_biology however clinical samples used in gene_expression studies are often derived from heterogeneous mixtures with variable cell_type composition complicating statistical_analysis considerable effort has been devoted to modeling sample_heterogeneity and presently there are many methods that can estimate cell proportions or pure cell_type expression from mixture data however there is no method that comprehensively addresses mixture analysis in the context of differential_expression without relying on additional proportion information which can be inaccurate and is frequently unavailable results in this study we consider a clinically_relevant situation where neither accurate proportion estimates nor pure cell expression is of direct interest but where we are rather interested in detecting and interpreting relevant differential_expression in mixture samples we develop a method cell_type computational differential estimation cellcode that addresses the specific statistical question directly without requiring a physical model for mixture components our approach is based on latent_variable analysis and is computationally transparent it requires no additional experimental_data yet outperforms_existing that use independent proportion measurements cellcode has few parameters that are robust and easy to interpret the method can be used to track changes in proportion improve power to detect differential_expression and assign the differentially_expressed to the correct cell_type availability_and the cellcode r package can be downloaded atdifferential expression analyses are used widely in the study of human_biology but their utility is often limited by the extreme variability and the resulting poor reproducibility of human molecular measurements one biological source of measurement variance is heterogeneity in sample_composition human samples are often mixtures of multiple cell_types with relative proportions that can vary several fold across samples for example in diseased brain cell_populations can change markedly as some cell_types die whereas others proliferate in cancer samples there may be different amounts of stromal_tissue and different sub populations of cancer_cells that are molecularly distinct schwartz and shackney cell_type variation is particularly pronounced in blood where proportions of different cell_types can vary fold naturally consequently it is well established that mrna and protein measurements from human blood or blood derivatives such as peripheral_blood pbmcs are extremely variable much effort has been devoted to the development of computational_methods that can accurately model and analyze mixture samples existing_approaches can computationally estimate proportions pure expression states or bothsimple matrix decomposition to complex iterative procedures importantly these methods are largely focused on estimating physical quantities pure expression states and proportions rather than statistical ones such as effects and interactions and most are not designed for differential_expression a recent r package unifying many of the existent methods lists only two dsection and cssam that can work as differential_expression pipelines and both require independent cell proportion measurements as input shen orr et_al had showed that cssam can be effective at addressing two questions it can be used both to find differentially_expressed de genes when standard statistical methods_fail and to assign the de genes to the cell_type in which their regulation has been altered the latter is an important goal as disease associated expression changes are expected to be cell_type and knowing which cells are affected by the disease_state is important for interpreting the results in this study we demonstrate that these two goals improving the power to detect de genes and assigning altered expression to the cell_type of origin can be effectively approached with latent_variable analysis our cell_type computational differential estimation cellcode method is designed for de analysis and requires no additional dataset specific knowledge in particular we demonstrate that by relying on the data_structure alone we can correct for mixture variation and improve statistical_power as well as or better than methods that use explicit cell proportion measurements we also show that the cellcode framework can be used to assign expression alterations to their cell_type of origin with high_accuracy our method is widely_applicable and we demonstrate that it can be used to derive new insights from existing data the biological_complexity of quantitative_measurements derived from mixture samples raises many challenges the variation of mixture components from sample to sample induces large variance in gene_expression making_it to detect relevant gene_regulation on the other hand the cell_type proportions themselves may be different between the clinical groups giving rise to many de genes that do not correspond to any actual transcriptional_regulation finally for genes that are altered within a cell_type the source of transcriptional_regulation is ambiguous as many cell_types are assayed together we propose a multi_step statistical_framework that uses latent_variable analysis to analyze differential_expression from mixture samples we first estimate a set of surrogate proportion variables spvs by cross_referencing putative marker_genes with the data correlation_structure these spvs are then included in the differential_expression to improve the detection of bona_fide regulated_genes finally the de genes are assigned to the cell_type in which they are regulated evaluating interaction between genes and estimated spvs we propose a method for dissecting mixture datasets that is specifically_designed for analyzing differential_expression our method extracts cell proportion covariates from the data_structure and estimates the confounding and interaction effects we demonstrate the sensitivity and accuracy of this method on simulated_data and its capacity to generate biological_insights using experimental_datasets our method neither requires nor utilizes independent proportion measurements even when such measurements are available because of various limitations in these data they may not produce optimal covariates for statistical_testing for example coulter_counter measurements can have an error of or more for the rare cell_types additionally some cell_types that are counted may preferentially lose rna due to processes such as apoptosis and consequently cell_counts may not accurately_reflect pooled mrna composition most importantly independent cell proportion measurements may not identify important molecularly distinct cell_types for example the study by shen orr et_al did not differentiate b cells and t cells which cannot be distinguished by the coulter principle alone in contrast cellcode can capture variation from molecularly distinct cell_types as long as some independent proportion variation in present and appropriate marker_genes are available despite these limitations of the independent cell proportion measurements it may be possible to develop a hybrid_approach that makes use of this additional information for example a method that constrains the estimated latent_variables to correlate with known covariatesfor an example might be adapted to extract mixture variation in summary we propose a statistical_framework for the analysis and interpretation of mixture samples that requires no dataset specific prior_knowledge yet performs comparably to or better than methods that use additional information we demonstrate the general_utility of evaluating interaction effects between known clinical groups and latent_variables in our case the latent_variables are celltype proportions but the methodology can be readily adapted to other latent sources of variation
