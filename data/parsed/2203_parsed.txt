hilbertcurve an r bioconductor_package for high_resolution visualization of genomic_data hilbert curves enable high_resolution visualization of genomic_data on a chromosome or genome_wide scale here we present the hilbertcurve package that provides an easy to use interface for mapping genomic_data to hilbert curves the package transforms the curve as a virtual axis thereby hiding the details of the curve construction from the user hilbertcurve supports multiple layer overlay that makes it a powerful_tool to correlate the spatial distribution of multiple feature_types availability_and the hilbertcurve package and documentation are freely_available from the bioconductor projecthilbert curves can be used to effectively visualize genomic_data because they can provide a global overview of genome_scale datasets while still revealing the spatial distribution of features at high_resolution hilbert curve visualization has been utilized to compare the sequence difference between human and other primates to show the spatial_organization of different chromatin_states and to investigate the genome wide_distribution of histone_modifications the hilbert curve is a spacefilling curve i e a continuous mapping of one dimensional axis to a two_dimensional area it is constructed recursively by dividing the two_dimensional square and in subsequent iterations the subsquares into four quadrants and folding the one dimensional line into a u shape to traverse all quadrants after k iterations the twodimensional space is split into k k grids and the one dimensional line folded into k segments the iteration level k of the hilbert curve controls the degree of folding with a higher k meaning a longer but also more densely_packed curve in a given space for example while in a linear visualization of human_chromosome of pixel length each pixel represents kb in a hilbert curve visualization of pixels each pixel represents only bp which greatly_increases the resolution by times importantly the hilbert curve preserves the locality of data_points meaning that if two data_points are in proximity on the onedimensional axis they are also close to each other in twodimensional space see demonstration in supplementary_file s it should be noted that the reverse is not always true and some points are close in the two dimensional_space while they are distant on the genome here we present hilbertcurve an r bioconductor_package for genomic_data visualization using hilbert curves hilbertcurve hides details of the curve construction and provides methods to add graphics only based on genomic positions this enables smooth integration of hilbertcurve in genomic analysis and distinguishes the package from currently available tools such as hilbertvis further advantages of hilbertcurve over other tools are the capability to visualize multiple chromosomes simultaneously and v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com support of multiple layer overlay a powerful method to investigate correlations between different features with these functionalities the hilbertcurve package will greatly_facilitate the visualization and interpretation of the ever increasing number of genome_wide datasets generated by next_generation and other omics techniques hilbert curve visualization of genomic_data can be used to assess the spatial distribution size_distribution and co localization of genomic_features together in a single plot illustrates sequence_conservation for human_chromosome compared to zebrafish the chromosome is mapped to a hilbert curve with level so that each point represents a window of kb the plot reveals large highly conserved_regions that alternate with regions of low conservation and non conserved_regions for comparison supplementary_file s also illustrates conservation between mouse and human histone_modifications e g methylation acetylation affect the chromatindna interaction and thus play a role in transcription_regulation visualizes the h_k modification in human_chromosome the curve is initialized with level and illustrated under pixel mode while h_k is indicated in red gene_bodies are illustrated as additional layer in grey overlapping regions are adjusted in purple to visualize the strong enrichment of
