genetics_and prefersim fast simulation of demography and selection under the poisson random field model the poisson random field prf model has become an important tool in population_genetics to study weakly deleterious genetic_variation under complicated demographic scenarios currently there are no freely_available software applications that allow simulation of genetic_variation data under this model here we present prefersim an ansi c program that performs forward simulations under the prf model prefersim models changes in population_size arbitrary amounts of inbreeding dominance and distributions of selective effects users can track summaries of genetic_variation over time and output trajectories of selected alleles understanding the behavior of selected mutations in finite populations is important in population medical and conservation genetics two main computational_approaches have been used to model weakly deleterious_mutations first under the poisson random field prf framework a poisson number of independent mutations enter the population each generation with subsequent changes in allele_frequency due to selection and drift the prf framework is a mainstay in population_genetic inference of demography and selection however existing implementations of the prf model do not provide the ages or selection coefficients of individual mutations or permit the user to follow allele_frequency trajectories over time moreover including biological complications like inbreeding at certain time points or dominance effects are difficult for the average user within existing software the second approach involves simulation of entire populations forward in time here individuals reproduce each generation in proportion to their fitness several software programs exist to perform such simulations including sfs code slim and fwdpp these programs are designed to simulate large regions of genetic_variation with linkage and arbitrary recombination and they track chromosomal_regions through time rather than the behavior of individual mutations thus unless the recombination_rate is exceptionally large they are not directly comparable to the prf model which assumes free recombination further these simulations may not be ideal for generating trajectories of selected alleles because the trajectories of v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com individual alleles may be altered through linkage to other selected_sites finally some features such as arbitrary amounts of inbreeding are not included in sfs code and slim the recently released go fish also models individual mutations but currently does not model distributions of fitness_effects nor does it have a complete stand alone software_package here we present a new program prefersim which combines these approaches and performs forward simulations under the prf model for a single population two features distinguish prefersim from existing implementations of the prf model and forward simulation programs first prefersim can track allele_frequencies over time and the ages and trajectories of individual mutations second prefersim can simulate large_amounts of genetic_variation data with free recombination quickly to demonstrate the performance of prefersim we generated the site_frequency sfs under a population expansion demographic model with a gamma_distribution of fitness_effects the sfs produced by prefersim is comparable to that generated using dadi additionally ages of deleterious alleles obtained from prefersim are comparable to classical theoretical_predictions made by maruyama supplementary in sum these results demonstrate that prefersim can generate predictions about the frequency_spectrum and allele ages under complex models of demography and selection example applications ofprefersim is a forward in time population_genetic simulation program that can generate data under the prf model considering complex demography and arbitrary models of selection and dominance given the growing interest in studying how demography affects deleterious variation across a wide_range of taxa there is a need for population_genetic software that can easily simulate large_amounts of data under complex evolutionary_models as such we anticipate that prefersim will play_an in future_studies comparison of the sfs between prefersim gray and the diffusion_approximation black dadi for complex demographic models with purifying_selection top the sfs are similar in a sample of chromosomes snps with counts greater than are combined in the last bin bottom sfs for a sample of chromosomes see supplementary text for a description of the model_parameters
