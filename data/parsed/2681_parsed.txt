gene_expression lce a link based cluster ensemble_method for improved gene_expression motivation it is far from trivial to select the most effective clustering method and its parameterization for a particular set of gene_expression data because there are a very large number of possibilities although many researchers still prefer to use hierarchical_clustering in one form or another this is often sub optimal cluster ensemble research solves this problem by automatically combining multiple data partitions from different clusterings to improve both the robustness and quality of the clustering result however many existing ensemble techniques use an association matrix to summarize sample cluster co occurrence statistics and relations within an ensemble are encapsulated only at coarse level while those existing among clusters are completely neglected discovering these missing associations may greatly extend the capability of the ensemble methodology for microarray_data clustering results the link based cluster ensemble lce method presented here implements these ideas and demonstrates outstanding performance experiment results on real gene_expression and synthetic datasets indicate that lce i usually outperforms the existing cluster ensemble algorithms in individual_tests and overall is clearly class leading ii generates excellent robust performance across different types of data especially with the presence of noise and imbalanced data clusters iii provides a high_level data matrix that is applicable to many numerical clustering techniques and iv is computationally_efficient for large_datasets and gene clustering the use of clustering is vital both for visualizing and extracting useful information from microarray_data however different algorithms or even the same algorithm with different parameters often provide distinct clusterings as a result it is extremely_difficult for users to decide which algorithm and parameters will be optimal for a given set of datathis is because no single_pass simple to whom correspondence should be addressed clustering_algorithm can perform the best for all datasets and discovering all types of cluster shapes and structures presented in data is impossible for any known clustering_algorithm clinical_researchers commonly use simple clustering_methods such as agglomerative hierarchical and k means to cluster cancer microarray samples despite the advent of several new techniques that capitalize on the inherent characteristics of gene_expression data noise and high_dimensionality to improve clustering quality e g desays this is because the use of such methods is difficult for non expert users recently cluster ensembles or consensus clusterings have emerged as simple effective one stop methods for improving the robustness and quality of clustering_results cluster ensembles combine multiple clustering decisions referred to as base clusterings or ensemble members where the base clusterings contain diversity in their choice of clusters by i using a single clustering_algorithm with random parameter initializations ii employing multiple clustering_algorithms iii selecting a random_number of clusters iv using different subsets of gene or v using data sampling_techniques most existing_methods compare cluster associations between each of the n samples in the dataset to produce an n n pairwise similarity matrix i e consensus agreement and co association matrices to which a consensus function e g agglomerative hierarchical_clustering is applied to acquire the final data partition with the ensemble of two base clusterings and five samples x x that is given in the corresponding similarity matrix is shown in an alternative approach strehl and to pairwise similarity methods makes use of an n p binary cluster association matrix bm where p denotes the number of clusters in an ensemble shows the example of such matrix that is generated from the ensemble of despite reported success and efficiency these methods generate the ultimate clustering result based on incomplete_information of a cluster ensemble the underlying association matrix presents samplecluster relations at a coarse level and completely ignores the relations among clusters as a result thethe results with real_gene are summarized in where each investigated clustering method is represented with its average validity measure across all validity indices datasets and ensemble types it is clear that lce regularly performs better than any of these clustering_methods it also enhances the performance of km which is used as base clusterings in particular hbgf is apparently less effective than lce this information suggests that the quality of the refined cluster association matrix rm is superior than the original bm counterpart see the full results with real gene_expression in supplementary section following the study of to rigourously evaluate the quality of investigated clustering techniques the number of times that one method is significantly better and worse to confidence_level than the others are assessed across all experiment settings let x c i be the average value of validity index c ca nmi ar across n runs n in this evaluation for a cluster ensemble_method i cm cm is a set of experimented clustering_methods on a specific experimentsetting st st is a set of unique combination of four

significantly_worse than its competitors w c i in accordance with the validity criterion c can be computed asusing the aforementioned assessment formalism illustrates for each method i cm the statistics of total performance the results shown in this figure indicate that lce is more effective than other clustering techniques included in this experiment since sl and al do not perform well over the examined datasets multi k and cc hc that use the former and latter as a consensus function respectively are less accurate than other cluster ensemble methods and km however their performance may improve with an ensemble that is much larger than the one investigated herein i e m in addition to this evaluation scheme a further performance analysis with a paired_t is discussed in supplementary section another important investigation is on the subject of relations between performance of experimented cluster ensemble methods and different types of ensemble being explored in the present evaluation shows the average validity measures of different cluster ensemble methods across all validity indices and real gene_expression for each method its performance with page and the performance of the lce method the averages of ca nmi and ar over real gene_expression and ensemble types whose values are presented in x axis and y axis respectively note that the averaged performance of other cluster ensemble methods are also included for a comparison purpose four ensemble types full space fixed k full space random k subspace fixed k and subspace random k are compared it is clear that lce is more effective than other cluster ensemble techniques over all ensemble types with its best performance being generated from a full space fixed k ensemble most methods work better with full space ensembles as compared to subspace alternatives unlike lce gcc and other graph_based techniques that usually produce a superior_performance with a fixed k ensemble type multi k and cc hc are best when coupled with random k ensembles although the results are impressive on several datasets it is important to ensure they are obtainable in a wide_range of conditions to this end the lce algorithms response was examined to perturbations in its parameters and by investigating its time and space complexity a new lce method has been introduced for clustering gene_expression data samples that has greatly_improved accuracy and efficiency the performance of lce is usually superior than existing graph_based ensemble techniques and those that are particularly developed for gene data analysis lce is highly_effective over real gene_expression and synthetic data collections with page
