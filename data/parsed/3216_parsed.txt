systems_biology netbiov an r package for visualizing large network data in biology and medicine netbiov network biology visualization is an r package that allows the visualization of large network data in biology and medicine the purpose of netbiov is to enable an organized and reproducible visualization of networks by emphasizing or highlighting specific structural_properties that are of biological_relevance availability_and netbiov is freely_available for academic use themodern research in the biological and biomedical_sciences is driven by technological_progress that routinely allows interrogating genetic or molecular_entities on a genomic_scale for the analysis and interpretation of high_throughput genomics experiments frequently networks are used because they enable a systems approach however the graphical_representation of networks for reasons of their exploratory_analysis interpretation or merely as a visualization is far from being trivial especially for large_networks containing hundreds_or of genes for this reason several software visualization_tools have been developed in the supplementary_file we compared our visualization software netbiov with cytoscape visant and yed in summary netbiov is fully integrated into r the gold_standard in the computational_biology community and hence can use all of its functionality for user specific expansions furthermore netbiov provides i global ii module iii information_flow and iv hierarchical layout styles discussed in the following not available in this form in other packages importantly the provided layout styles run efficiently even for large_networks
