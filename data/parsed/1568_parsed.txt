structural_bioinformatics elemental_composition determination based on ms n motivation identification of metabolites is essential for its use as biomarkers for research in systems_biology and for drug_discovery the first step before a structure can be elucidated is to determine its elemental_composition high_resolution which provides the exact mass together with common constraint rules for rejecting false proposed elemental_compositions cannot always provide one unique elemental_composition solution results the multistage elemental formula mef tool is presented in this article to enable the correct assignment of elemental_composition to compounds their fragment_ions and neutral losses that originate from the molecular_ion by using multistage mass_spectrometry ms n the method provided by mef reduces the list of predicted elemental_compositions for each ion by analyzing the elemental_compositions of its parent precursor ion and descendants fragments ms n data of several metabolites were processed using the mef tool to assign the correct elemental_composition and validate the efficacy of the method especially the link between the mass accuracy needed to generate one unique elemental_composition and the topology of the ms n tree the width and the depth of the tree was addressed this method makes an important step toward semi_automatic de_novo identification of metabolites using ms n data availability software available at http abs metabolomics is the extensive examination of the metabolic_phenotype the metabolome under a specific set of conditions it has emerged as a functional key to understand the behavior of complex_biological including cells tissues and biofluids currently the essential challenges addressed in metabolomics are identification full coverage of the metabolome with structural_characterization and quantification accurately measure concentrations at low_abundance levels metabolite_identification to enable proper biological_interpretation is the first step in the research of to whom correspondence should be addressed biomarkers systems_biology and drug_discovery kind and electrospray_ionization esi enabled mass_spectrometry ms to become the most essential analytical tool used in both quantitative and qualitative metabolomic research in combination with liquid or gas_chromatography ms is the widely_accepted standard method for the analysis of metabolomic samples in this way each compound in the measured sample is characterized by a retention time and a mass value however this characterization is not sufficient for metabolite_identification and the first step toward elucidation of the chemical_structure from an unidentified compound is the determination of its elemental_composition an elemental_composition expresses which and how many atoms constitute a particular chemical compound although each elemental_composition has an unique molecular_weight mass a molecular_weight does not have a unique elemental_composition this situation is complicated by the instrumental precision and the accuracy of the mass measurements limits this viability nowadays mass_spectrometry instrumentation such as time of flight ion cyclotron resonance or magnetic sectors are able to measure mass to charge ratios m z with a mass accuracy up to ppm parts_per meaning that a mass of da is measured accurately up to four decimal places in addition modern desktop computers together with available software_tools make it possible to generate and verify instantaneously all theoretical possible chemical elemental_compositions for a given mass regrettably several studies have shown that even high_mass smaller than ppm does not necessarily result in one unique assigned elemental_composition the number of possible elemental_compositions increases exponentially with the mass and the set of chemical_elements taken into account generally available methods that derive the elemental_composition from a given mass use the following three steps generation filtering and matching the generation step generates a candidate list with all possible elemental_compositions enumerated systematically the filtering step rejects all the elemental_compositions that do not satisfy certain rules the matching step compares the theoretical isotope patterns with the experimental one the best match is reflected as the most probable elemental_composition normally the elemental_composition annotation_process starts when the user provides a constraint set consisting of the mass of the ion the set of chemical_elements to include and exclude the limit range of number of atoms for each element and the mass tolerance mass error window there are two different approaches for generating the elemental_composition and these depend on thepage due to fast recent instrumentation developments ms n has become a powerful_tool for the characterization of metabolites a new method was developed that can be applied for the processing and analysis of multistage mass_spectrometry ms n data this method resolves the chemical elemental_composition of a compound using constraints extracted from the predicted elemental_composition of its fragments and requires a lower mass accuracy than conventional methods the viability of the mef method was tested with experiments on real ms n data of several metabolites the method does not only list the elemental_composition of the parent ion but also of its fragments and the neutral losses the results presented here show that the method assigns very efficiently the correct elemental_composition while reducing the needed accuracy to middle mass tolerance depending on the chemical_structure of the metabolite and the topology of the fragmentation tree analyzed for hydroxylisine the mass tolerance needed to solve the elemental_composition jumps from ppm to ppm when additional fragmentation tree information is added as a constraint this approach shows that the ms level is a relevant_factor to help with the assignment of the elemental_composition if ms n spectra are acquired to a higher_level the maximum mass tolerance to determine the correct elemental_composition using the mef tool is getting higher to obtain the elemental_composition of a protonated molecule or adduct this approach lowers the requirements with regards to mass accuracy of a mass_spectrometer if ms or higher ms level spectra can be obtained and can be combined with the isotopic pattern of the protonated molecule or adduct this decreasing need for highly_accurate data to solve the elemental_composition by adding fragmentation tree information could help for those groups which cannot effort an expensive instrument with powerful resolution power alternatively it will reduce the time needed to perform an identification the output with the fragmentation pattern containing the elemental_compositions is stored in a cml file_format waiting for a proximate future for a standard exchange file_format specific for metabolites currently the mef method provides a list of elemental_composition candidates ordered according to the difference of the measured mass in future work it is planned to implement additional constraint rules into the method and also apply isotope abundance analysis to increase the identification_accuracy as we are able to characterize the fragments and neutral losses with the elemental_composition we are moving toward getting better understanding of the fragmentation_patterns and use this information to identify the correct structure of unknown compounds
