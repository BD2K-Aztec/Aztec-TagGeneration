chicp a web_based for the integrative and interactive_visualization of promoter capture hi c datasets promoter capture hi c pchi c allows the genome_wide interrogation of physical_interactions between distal dna regulatory_elements and gene_promoters in multiple tissue contexts visual integration of the resultant chromosome interaction maps with other sources of genomic_annotations can provide insight into underlying regulatory_mechanisms we have developed capture hic plotter chicp a web_based that allows interactive_exploration of pchi c interaction maps and integration with both public and user_defined genomic_datasets availability_and chicp is freely_accessible from www chicp org and supports most major html compliant web_browsers full source_code and installation_instructions are available from http github com d i l django chicp a large majority of single_nucleotide snvs associated with human disease lie outside of known coding_regions and are enriched in dnase_i hypersensitive regions promoter capture hi c enables the detection of physical chromatin_interactions between gene promoter_regions and distal dna gene_expression regulatory_elements globally and at high_resolution by integrating with genome_wide association data it may be possible to gain further insight into the genetic mechanisms_underlying a particular trait or disease however owing to a dependence on restriction_enzymes in the underlying method defined interactions are based on specific restriction fragment intervals the resultant genomic interaction maps are therefore complex as a single promoter fragment can interact with multiple distal restriction_fragments of heterogeneous size and interactions may vary across different tissue contexts current genome_browsers with capabilities for the visualization of these interactions such as washu epigenome browser and ensembl provide a linear view which can limit a users ability to resolve these complex interaction_patterns and how they relate to other genomic_features of interest a circular representation can be helpful in this context but existing circular viewers such as j circos circos gview and genomed plot are not specifically_designed and optimized to allow interactive and integrative visualization of human pchi c datasets chicp employs a hybrid_approach users see a circular overview for all interactions for a given snv gene or region with the option to highlight a particular interaction of interest that results in a standard linear view we demonstrate its functionality by integrating a recent promoter capture hi c dataset with publically available gwas summary_statistics http www immuno base org ensembl gene_annotations the user_interface and visualization of chicp consists of a search toolbox on the left_hand side of the browser window that allows searching of the configured pchi c and association_statistics datasets by gene name ensembl gene id reference snp_rs id or a genomic_region e g chr tissue context can be altered by using radio buttons labeled with available tissue_types followed in brackets by the number of significant interactions for that type finally the association study drop down menu allows users to integrate either public or private genetic_association summary_statistics the data visualization is split into three panels a central navigation panel showing a circularized overview of interactions and annotations for current search_term and two right hand detail panels from the centre of the circular plot matching interactions from the selected tissue context are shown as coloured arcs connecting restriction_fragments moving outwards association summary_statistics are shown in a circularized manhattan plot by default genome_wide significant associations p are shown in green genes are coloured according to biotype finally a genomic_scale is displayed with red tick marks detailing the positions of restriction_enzyme fragments clicking on an interaction opens a linear representation of the bait and target_regions in separate panels on the right hand side h with genes shown in canonical format and outlined exons flagging transcription_start where data are available extra tracks showing epigenetic states of the cells are shown buttons in the top bar allow snapshotting of the current_view for the purposes of sharing and figure generation we used chicp to not only validate the findings of misfud et_al that nrip is a likely causal gene in ulcerative_colitis uc but additionally that uc genome_wide significant variants fromoverlap cd specific enhancer regions datasets across multiple tissue_types enter the public_domain visualization_tools such as ours will have increasing utility in making these results accessible in the context of other relevant genomic_annotations it might also provide a platform for creating a browsable pchi c compendium that has the possibility to facilitate the understanding of the role of regulatory variation in human disease in specific tissue contexts indeed future work will examine the feasibility of adding functionality for users to add their own public and private interaction datasets as well as further modifications to allow the general visualization of other sources of high_resolution hi c data e g enhancer capture future user_interface improvements might allow for a more exploratory approach at the genome_wide scale the software is freely_available is implemented using standard open_source web components and thus can be modified to support diverse use cases and datasets both publicly and privately
