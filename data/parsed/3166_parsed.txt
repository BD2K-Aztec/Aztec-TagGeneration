data_and multiqc summarize analysis results for multiple tools and samples in a single report motivation fast and accurate quality_control is essential for studies involving next_generation data whilst numerous tools exist to quantify qc metrics there is no common approach to flexibly integrate these across tools and large sample_sets assessing analysis results across an entire project can be time consuming and error_prone batch_effects and outlier samples can easily be missed in the early_stages of analysis results we present multiqc a tool to create a single report visualising output from multiple tools across many samples enabling global trends and biases to be quickly identified multiqc can plot data from many common bioinformatics_tools and is built to allow easy extension and customization advances in next_generation are leading to an avalanche of data whilst opening doors to new analysis types and experimental_designs expanding sample numbers make studies increasingly vulnerable to confounding batch_effects such biases are often subtle and difficult to detect and require careful quality_control measures most bioinformatics programs produce logs detailing their results dedicated qc tools such as fastqc http www bioinfor_matics babraham ac uk projects fastqc qualimap and rseqc are excellent at highlighting potential problems in data however nearly all of these logs and reports are produced on a per sample basis requiring the user to find and compile qc results this process is time consuming repetitive and complex making it prone to errors multiqc addresses this problem by scanning given analysis directories for log files and qc reports creating a single summary report visualizing results across all samples collecting data within a single report provides a fast way to scan key statistics quickly and easily shared plots allow accurate comparison between samples allowing detection of subtle differences not noticeable when switching between different files data visualization aids batch_effect detection and minimizes the risk of confounding factors_affecting the results of the study multiqc is the first tool of its type within the field it has the potential to greatly improve quality_control and reporting for researchers involved in next_generation removing the need for custom comparative scripts as the field of next_generation matures there are increasing numbers of bioinformatics_tools producing ever more verbose descriptions of data integrating these statistics across tools with large sample_sets is difficult and time consuming multiqc can automate the parsing of this metadata providing powerful visualizations with a simple interface extension and data export allow multiqc to function as a central collection point at the terminus of analysis_pipelines routine use can aid quality_control steps early on in data_processing reducing risk of batch_effects and other downstream_analysis problems
