data_and privacy preserving microbiome_analysis using secure computation motivation developing targeted_therapeutics and identifying biomarkers relies on large_amounts of research participant data beyond human dna scientists now investigate the dna of microorganisms inhabiting the human_body recent work shows that an individuals collection of microbial dna consistently identifies that person and could be used to link a real_world identity to a sensitive attribute in a research dataset unfortunately the current suite of dna specific privacy preserving analysis tools does not meet the requirements for microbiome sequencing studies results to address privacy_concerns around microbiome sequencing we implement metage nomic analyses using secure computation our implementation allows comparative_analysis over combined data without revealing the feature counts for any individual sample we focus on three analyses and perform an evaluation on datasets currently used by the microbiome research_community we use our implementation to simulate sharing data between four policy domains additionally we describe an application of our implementation for patients to combine data that allows drug developers to query against and compensate patients for the analysis availability_and the software is freely_available for download at microbiome sequencing seeks to characterize and classify the composition and structure of microbial_communities from metagenomic dna samples it is estimated that only in cells in and on a persons body contain that individuals dna the remainder corresponding to microbial dna most from organisms that cannot be cultured and studied in the laboratory the human_microbiome hmp the global enterics multi_center study msd the personal genome_project and the american gut project aim to characterize the ecology of human_microbiota and its impact on human_health potentially pathogenic or probiotic_bacteria can be identified by detecting significant differences in their distribution across healthy and disease populations while the biology has led to promising results privacy_concerns of microbiome research are now being identified with no secure analysis tools available recent work byshows that microbiome data are an unique_identifier across time points in a dataset and could be used to link a sensitive attribute to an individual earlier work byshowed that it is possible to identify an object that v c the author published_by in this section we describe related work and provide a context for our contribution we also discuss a use case for our solution in building datasets and finally present conclusions we formed during the course of our work
