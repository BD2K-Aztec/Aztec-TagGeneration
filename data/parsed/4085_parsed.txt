structural_bioinformatics rs webpredictor a server for predicting cyp mediated sites of metabolism on drug like molecules regioselectivity webpredictor rs webpredictor is a server that predicts isozyme specific cytochrome_p cyp mediated sites of metabolism soms on drug like molecules predictions may be made for the promiscuous c d and a cyp isozymes as well as cyps a a b c c and e rs webpredictor is the first freely_accessible server that predicts the regioselectivity of the last six isozymes server execution time is fast taking on average s to encode a submitted molecule and s to apply a given model allowing for high_throughput use in lead_optimization projects availability rs webpredictor is accessible for free use atthe cytochrome_p s cyps are a family of heme thiolate proteins that metabolize of fda_approved most cyps are regioselective strongly favouring the oxidation of certain sites of metabolism soms over others knowledge of the soms the specific atom s of a molecule that are oxidized by specific cyp isozymes is valuable information for early_stage lead design and optimization armed with this knowledge medicinal chemists can make rational modifications to a candidate lead in order to change its cyp mediated metabolism one way to use regioselectivity knowledge to perform rational lead_optimization is to increase drug bioavailability based upon individual cypexpression profile while retaining patient uniform end target efficacy unfortunately determining the isozyme specific soms of early_stage lead candidates through experimental means is timeand resource_intensive and not feasible for application to every candidate consequently several groups in recent_years developed in silico som prediction_models regioselectivity predictor rs predictor is an algorithm for creating accurate isozyme specfic som prediction_models from any set of known substrates and metabolites in prior work we manually_curated the public literature to identify cyp substrates and metabolites distributed across nine isozymes the largest collection of cytochrome_p metabolite data released to date rs predictor was able to identify experimentally_observed som s within the top two rank positions for substrate sets of each cyp isozyme with high levels of cross_validated accuracy cyp isozyme number of substrates accuracy a a b c c c d e a these accuracies were significantly_higher than those of commercial methods stardrop from optibrium and the p som prediction workflow offered by schrodingerschrodinger for c d and a sets respectively although there have been a number of som prediction_models for these three isozymes rs predictor offers the first ligand based models for the remaining six isozymes the full details of the rs predictor algorithm have been described in prior work and are summarized here rs predictor calibrates an isozyme specific regioselectivity qsar from a set of known isozyme substrates and metabolites by treating each substrate as an individual competition between candidate soms each som is represented by topological descriptorsis the som in an aromatic_ring what is the size of the ring what is the distribution of different atom types and bond_lengths away from the given som etc and a smartcyp derived reactivity descriptor smartcyp is an open_source ligand based method that encoded density_functional derived transition_state energies of molecule substructures with an isozyme non specific cyp heme into a reactivity look up table next som prediction_models are created using mirank multiple instance ranking a generalization of support_vector that is specifically_designed to optimize the ranking of observed soms over non observed soms on a substrate by substrate basis it is important to note that these models do not predict whether the given molecule is metabolized by a particular isozyme they predict the exact location on that molecule that would be oxidized by that cyp if the molecule is a substrate for that particular isozyme this limitation is shared by all other som prediction_models a comprehensive_review of which was made by still the high prediction_accuracies of rs predictor to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please email journals permissions_oup com models and the fact that they encapsulate the largest collection of cyp substrate and metabolite information publicly_available make free access to predictions made by them a valuable contribution to the scientific and pharmaceutical communities
