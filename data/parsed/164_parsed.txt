sequence_analysis agos a universal web_tool for gw argonaute binding_domain prediction motivation ago argonaute binding_domains composed of repeated motifs in which only binary combinations of tryptophan and glycine are conserved bind ago proteins and are essential during rnai mediated gene_silencing the amino_acid of this domain is extremely divergent and therefore very difficult to detect commonly used bioinformatic_tools fail to identify tryptophanglycine and or glycinetryptophan motifs wg gw domains and currently there is no publicly_available software which can detect these weakly conserved but functional ago binding segments results recently we have developed an algorithm based on compositional_analysis of the amino_acid of the domain we have demonstrated that the algorithm can be successfully_applied for the identification of the new wg gw proteins in the arabidopsis_genome here we introduce agos argonaute binding_domain screener a novel universal web_service for de_novo identification of wg gw domains in protein_sequences the web implementation of the algorithm contains several new features and enhancements i one universal scoring_matrix which allows identification of ago binding_proteins in sequences representing all organisms ii reduction of false_positive by improved selectivity of the algorithm iii graphical_interface to easily browse the prediction results and iv the option to submit a dna_sequence which will be automatically translated in six frames before running the prediction algorithm the wg gw domains recruit argonaute ago proteins to distinct_components of the eukaryotic rna_silencing pathways and are strictly required for gene_silencing by rna_interference rnai the sequences of the domain are extremely divergent and are composed of quasi repeated regions containing conserved tryptophanglycine and or glycinetryptophan motifs henceforth called wg gw motifs which are essential for binding multiple molecules of ago proteins the hypervariable sequencespage
