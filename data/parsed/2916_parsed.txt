metaquast evaluation of metagenome assemblies during the past_years we have witnessed the rapid development of new metagenome_assembly methods although there are many benchmark utilities designed for single genome_assemblies there is no well recognized evaluation and comparison tool for metagenomic specific analogues in this article we present metaquast a modification of quast the state of the art tool for genome_assembly evaluation based on alignment of contigs to a reference metaquast addresses such metagenome datasets features as i unknown species content by detecting and downloading reference_sequences ii huge diversity by giving comprehensive reports for multiple_genomes and iii presence of highly relative species by detecting chimeric contigs we demonstrate metaquast performance by comparing several leading assemblers on one simulated and two real_datasets availability_and http bioinf spbau ru metaquast metagenomics studies genetic_material taken directly from environmental_samples ngs_technologies allow for extracting short_reads even from low abundant organisms without cloning however the data produced in such experiments tend to be enormous noisy and contain fragments from thousands of species highly varying in abundance and homology those challenges led to a new computational_problem of metagenome_assembly followed by a diversity of methods which demands a standard benchmark procedure most existing assembly evaluation approaches are not designed to work with metagenomes however there exist methods which count read likelihoods with respect to the assembly or determine single_copy conservative ubiquitous gene content unfortunately none uses contig alignments to a closely_related reference_genome in this article we present metaquast a metagenomic specific improvement over quast quast detects errors based on alignments to a given closely_related reference_genome and also reports and plots contig statistics like n and gene content which gives an overview of constituent species even without user supplied reference_sequences to address metagenome assemblies metaquast adds several new features i ability of using an unlimited number of reference_genomes ii automated species content detection iii detection of chimeric contigs interspecies misassemblies and iv significantly redesigned visualizations we tested metaquast on three datasets the cami http camichallenge org simulated toy dataset the mh sample from metahit and the srs tongue dorsum female sample from hmp we assembled these data using four leading assemblers commonly used in metagenomic_studies idba ud spades ray meta and soapdenovo comparisons results and metaquast performance on all three datasets are demonstrated in supplementary_material the comparison on these datasets demonstrated that none of the assemblers can be called an undisputed leader in metagenomic assembly thus tools such as metaquast are of great practical importance for the community it will help scientists to assess different assembly software and choose the best pipeline for their research
