structural_bioinformatics pesdserv a server for high_throughput comparison of protein binding_site surfaces structure based_approaches complement ligand based_approaches for lead_discovery and cross_reactivity prediction we present to the scientific_community a web_server for comparing the surface of a ligand bound site of a protein against a ligand bound site surface database of sites the web_server implements the property encoded shape distributions pesd algorithm for surface comparison a typical virtual screen takes min to complete the output provides a ranked_list of sites by site similarity hyperlinked to the corresponding entries in the pdb and pdbechem databases availability the server is freely_accessible atthe numerous genome_sequencing have revealed that proteins involved in entirely different biochemical_pathways and even residing in different tissues and organs may possess functional binding_pockets with similar shapes and physiochemical_properties the need to compare protein binding_sites and establish structurefunction relationships across protein_families has become ever more important three direct outcomes of such an effort are i identification of lead_compounds for target hopping ii repositioning an existing drug and iii predicting adverse_side the discovery of low_molecular somatostatin_receptor hsst r antagonists involved use of astemizole as the lead structure whose original target was h a histamine receptor h has binding_site amino_acid similar to hsst rs the work byutilizing the soippa algorithm is an example of how a catechol_o inhibitor used for treating parkinsons disease can be repositioned as a lead compound for treating multi_drug and extensively drug_resistant since the compound has an excellent safety_profile repositioning it to treat drug_resistant offers to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as significant incentives side_effects are a serious cause for concern in chemotherapy a study byfound that out of active_compounds over had activity for more than one target while ligand based_approaches can point to such cross_reactivity they may not be sufficient in cases where ligands with low apparent similarity bind on to the same target the property encoded shape distributions pesd algorithm offers high_throughput binding_site comparison that makes it suitable for mining large_databases such as the protein_data pdb there are several web_based services and stand alone programs for comparison of ligand_binding in proteins the sitesbase server uses a geometric hashing algorithm on an allatom based representation of the binding_site the siteengine and multibind servers also utilize a geometric hashing based search protocol that compares pseudo center representations of binding_sites the catalytic_site search server http www ebi ac uk thornton srv databases cgi bin css makeebihtml cgi file form html based on the jess algorithm searches for specific groups of residues pdbsitescan works on a reduced representation of atoms utilizing n c and c and implements a combinatorial extension algorithm followed by alignment for similarity detection the sumo server matches graphs representing triplets of functional_groups such as unbound hydrogen_bond donors or acceptors accessible sides of aromatic_rings and carboxylate primary amide etc the fuzcav program utilizes a generic cavity fingerprint generated from a labeled c representation of the binding_site in we have shown that binding_sites can have similar shape and property distributions on the surface and yet show low conservation in underlying residue pseudo center or atom composition in such cases methods based on residue pseudo center or atom representations may not be able to detect the similarity that is evident from the surface the ef site server can work directly on electrostatic_potential mapped surfaces however it uses a clique detection based algorithm that is np_hard and slow for high_throughput global similarity_searches the pesd algorithm implemented in the pesdserv binding_site comparison server presented here overcomes this limitation and quickly returns a list of globally similar ligand bound site surfaces from the pdb in a few minutes
