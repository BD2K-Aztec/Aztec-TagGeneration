probabilistic_method for detecting copy_number in a fetal genome using maternal_plasma sequencing motivation the past several years have seen the development of methodologies to identify genomic_variation within a fetus through the non_invasive sequencing of maternal blood_plasma these methods are based on the observation that maternal_plasma contains a fraction of dna typically originating from the fetus and such methodologies have already been used for the detection of whole chromosome events aneuploidies and to a more limited extent for smaller typically several megabases long copy_number cnvs results here we present a probabilistic_method for non_invasive analysis of de_novo cnvs in fetal genome based on maternal_plasma sequencing our novel method combines three types of information within a unified hidden_markov the imbalance of allelic ratios at snp positions until recently the prenatal analysis of a fetal genome required samples directly obtained from the fetus by invasive_procedures like chorionic_villus or amniocentesis where amniotic_fluid is sampled from around the developing fetus amniocentesis however has several important disadvantages foremost it carries a non trivial risk of miscarriage estimated procedure related fetal_loss rate is and hence is refused by a fraction of patients secondly amniocentesis cannot be performed too early as the risk of miscarriage rises significantly and is typically indicated for the th week of pregnancy outside of the time frame for the safest abortion options weeks and leaving only limited time for follow_up analysis finally amniocentesis is a complex and expensive medical procedure consequently amniocentesis is typically performed only to confirm or reject a diagnosis if a genetic disease is suspected e g high likelihood of down syndrome based on prenatal_ultrasound the last several years has seen the initial development of alternative non_invasive methods for prenatal genetic_testing prominent among these are methods that are based on analysis arrays or sequencing of cell_free cfdna extracted from maternal blood_plasma which contains an admixture of fetal and maternal dna the fraction of fetal dna in such an admixture varies depending on multiple factors including maternal_weight and size of the fetus but typically builds up from early in the pregnancy to at week to as much as before delivery in experiments_conducted by and utilized in this article the estimated admixture in samples obtained at weeks and weeks of gestation was and respectively the decreasing cost of dna_sequencing has made it practical to directly sequence cfdna extracted from maternal_blood to identify likely genetic_disorders present in the fetus non_invasive methods are becoming more commonly used to directly identify aneuploidies abnormal chromosome counts and are also enabling preventive screening for heritable genetic_diseases resulting in better prenatal health_care while most non_invasive genetic diagnostics aim to test for a particular previously known biomarker demonstrated the possibility of the reconstruction of the whole_genome of the fetus by combining whole_genome of parental genomes with deep_sequencing of cfdna from maternal_plasma coverage the key intuition in this method is the comparison of allelic ratios at individual snp loci as the inheritance of a particular paternal allele affects the percentage of reads with that allele at the particular position in the genome this method heavily relies on the availability of phased parental genotypes as these allow for the inference of likely co inherited snps leading to an improvement in the signal_to it consequently provides for high_accuracy identification of inherited accuracy but not de_novo single_nucleotide correct calls out of true de_novo sites with called positions while most efforts to detect copy_number cnvs from cfdna sequencing have so_far concentrated on wholechromosome events e g the past year has seen the first few attempts at methods for genome_wide identification of sub chromosomal de_novo cnvs such methods are desired to enable non_invasive prenatal_screening for diseases like digeorge_syndrome mb deletion prader_willi the deletion subtype caused by a mb deletion and other disorders associated with a mid to large_sized cnv so_far two manuscripts address the problem of detecting sub chromosomal cnvs while the exact methods used in both of these approaches differ both rely on depth of coverage they map the reads to the genome to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons http creativecommons org licenses by which permits non commercial re use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com divide the genome into bins and identify the cnvs by comparing the number of reads_mapped to each bin the key idea in these methods is that deletions duplications will result in more fewer fetal reads within a window and this difference can be identified using statistical_methods use depth ofcoverage computed in mb windows across the genome to identify cnvs that are typically mb though they do report discovery of a kb cnv nine of the discovered cnvs in patients were concordant with karyotyping results with most discrepancies being short mb cnvs importantly they use extremely short bp reads allowing for larger number of fragments at equal coverage depth use even larger mb windows again considering only the number of fragments mapped and are able to successfully_identify variants mb with only one false_positive among six true_positives in patients both methods utilize low coverage wgs of the plasma cfdna while leveraging the large number of samples in this manuscript we introduce a novel model for noninvasive prenatal identification of de_novo cnvs with increased sensitivity compared with methods published so_far our method combines three types of information within a unified probabilistic_model first our method takes_advantage of the imbalance of allelic ratios at snp positions that are introduced by various types of paternally and maternally_inherited cnvs secondly following the work of we use parental genotypes to phase nearby snps modelling their co inheritance or recombination and thus improving the signal_to finally we observed that allelic ratios poorly differentiate between certain types of cnvs for example as further described below a duplication of a paternally inherited allele results in extremely similar allelic ratios to deletion of a maternally_inherited one we thus combine the allelic ratios with the depthof coverage signal to better differentiate between such cases our simulation_results based on in silico introduction of novel cnvs into plasma_samples with fetal dna concentration demonstrate a sensitivity of for cnvs kb with calls in an unaffected genome and for kb cnvs with calls in an unaffected genome
