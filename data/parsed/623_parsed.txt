data_and automatic recognition of conceptualization zones in scientific_articles and two life_science applications motivation scholarly biomedical publications report on the findings of a research investigation scientists use a well established discourse structure to relate their work to the state of the art express their own motivation and hypotheses and report on their methods results and conclusions in previous work we have proposed ways to explicitly annotate the structure of scientific investigations in scholarly publications here we present the means to facilitate automatic access to the scientific discourse of articles by automating the recognition of categories at the sentence level which we call core scientific concepts corescs these include hypothesis motivation goal object background method experiment model observation result and conclusion corescs provide the structure and context to all statements and relations within an article and their automatic recognition can greatly_facilitate biomedical information_extraction by characterizing the different types of facts hypotheses and evidence available in a scientific publication results we have trained and compared machine_learning support_vector and conditional_random on a corpus of full articles in biochemistry and chemistry to automatically recognize corescs we have evaluated our automatic classifications against a manually_annotated gold_standard and have achieved promising accuracies with experiment background and model being the categories with the highest f scores and respectively we have analysed the task of coresc annotation both from a sentence classification as well as sequence labelling perspective and we present a detailed feature evaluation the most discriminative features are local sentence features such as unigrams bigrams and grammatical dependencies while features encoding the document structure such as section headings also play_an for some of the categories we discuss the usefulness of automatically generated corescs in two biomedical_applications as well as work in progress availability a web_based for the automatic_annotation of articles with corescs and corresponding documentation is available online atsince the launch of the first scientific journal in philosophical transactions of the royal_society the scientific_literature has developed into the core medium for the exchange of ideas and findings across all scientific communities in recent_years numerous initiatives have emerged to automatically process electronic documents in the life_sciences add semantic markup to them and facilitate access to scientific facts most work in biological text_mining has concentrated on identifying biological_entities and extracting the relations between these entities as facts or events appearing in article abstracts while recently the focus has shifted towards full_text while system performance on biomolecular event_extraction is improving there is little progress in the analysis of the context of extracted events and relations which help to characterize the knowledge conveyed within the text and build the argumentation within the article discourse the analysis of the scientific discourse plays_a in differentiating between the nature of the knowledge encoded in relations and events e g ahr agonists suppress b lymphopoiesis in the fourth sentence ofis a known fact whereas the potential of two ahr agonists to alter stromal_cell cytokine_responses in sentence is a hypothesis to be investigated such a distinction between events or relations is currently ignored in standard biomedical information_extraction discourse_analysis of this type would improve the distinction between facts speculative statements pre_existing and new work in factual sentences denoted as background sentences and are distinguished from a sentence containing information inferred from the background a hypothesis driving and justifying the work presented in the article hypothesis sentence sentence which conveys the aim of the work as being that of evaluating a certain hypothesis is annotated as both goal and hypothesis the categorization of sentences within scientific discourse has been studied in previous work and from a number of different angles simone teufel created argumentative zoning az an annotation scheme which models rhetorical and argumentational aspects of scientific writing and concentrates on author claims az has been modified for the annotation of biology articles and chemistry articles other work has looked at the annotation of information structure in abstracts based on abstract sections a separate line of work has looked at the characterization of scientific discourse in terms of modality and speculation whileannotate sentences according to various dimensions such as focus polarity and certainty there is as yet no general consensus among researchers in scientific discourse regarding the optimal unit of annotation most of the previous_research considers sentences as their basic_unit while dehas proposed the annotation at the clause level andandconsider a multi_dimensional scheme for the annotation of biological_events in texts bio events existing schemes vary in their scope and granularity with ones designed for abstracts considering only four categories and schemes for full articles generally consisting of at most seven content related categories however especially for the case of full articles it is becoming apparent that more information is required to characterize statements and claims researchers are interested in identifying hypotheses and different types of evidence to support claims which are not readily_identifiable by current schemes our work fills the need for finer grained annotation to capture the content and conceptual structure of a scientific article inspired by the definitions in the expo ontology for scientific experiments and the cisp meta_data in liakata and soldatova andwe introduced a sentence based three layer scheme which recognizes the main components of scientific investigations as represented in articles seeand supplementary_material the first layer consists of categories which describe the main components of a scientific investigation the second layer is properties of those categories e g novelty advantage and the third layer provides identifiers that link together instances of the same concept in comparison to closely_related schemes none of which have been automated yet the core scientific concept coresc scheme makes finer grained distinctions between the different types of objective hypothesisgoalmotivationobject approach methodmodelexperiment and outcome observationresult conclusion and constitutes the most fine_grained analysis of knowledge types of any such scheme the distinction between the above types of objective approach and outcome are important to expert needs for more details see the definitions and explanations in the supplementary_material the coresc scheme has been applied to articles in biochemistry and chemistry to create a corpus of annotated articles art coresc corpus sentences titles over million words showed that a finer level of annotation of cancer risk_assessment cra abstracts using coresc categories increased experts efficiency in extracting information from the text whileargue that the coresc scheme is uniquely_suited to recovering common types of scientific arguments about hypotheses explanations and evidence in this article we automate the annotation of full scientific_articles with categories from the first layer of the coresc scheme provide intrinsic evaluation of the results and discuss existing and future applications of this work the article is structured as follows in section we describe how we trained and tested machine_learning on automatic recognition of corescs in full articles in section we analyse the classifier performance and discuss the features used for building the classifiers and their contributions to each category finally in section we discuss existing and future applications of the work our system for the classification of corescs our guidelines and annotated articles are all available online for researchers in biology to use to our knowledge this is the first time a discourse annotation scheme is being used to automatically annotate full articles in the biosciences on this scale it is also the first such scheme for which machine_learning have been trained and tested on chemistry articles both the resources and the tools for automatic_annotation are available online
