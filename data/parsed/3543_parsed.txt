phylocsf a comparative_genomics method to distinguish protein coding_and motivation as high_throughput provides evidence for novel transcripts in many species there is a renewed need for accurate methods to classify small genomic_regions as protein_coding or non coding we present phylocsf a novel comparative_genomics method that analyzes a multispecies nucleotide sequence_alignment to determine_whether it is likely to represent a conserved protein coding_region based on a formal statistical_comparison of phylogenetic codon models results we show that phylocsfs classification_performance in species drosophila genome alignments exceeds all other methods we compared in a previous study we anticipate that this method will be widely_applicable as the transcriptomes of many additional species tissues and subcellular_compartments are sequenced particularly in the context of encode and modencode and as interest grows in long_non often initially recognized by their lack of protein_coding potential rather than conserved rna_secondary availability_and the objective caml source_code and executables for gnu linux and mac os x are freely_available athigh throughput transcriptome_sequencing mrna seq is yielding precise structures for novel transcripts in many species including mammals accurate computational_methods are needed to classify these transcripts and the corresponding genomic exons as protein_coding or non coding even if the transcript models are incomplete or if they only reveal novel exons of alreadyknown genes in addition to classifying novel transcript models such methods also have applications in evaluating and revising existing gene_annotations and as input_features for de_novo gene structure predictors we have previously compared numerous methods for determining whether an exon length nucleotide_sequence is likely to be protein_coding or non coding including single_sequence metrics that analyze the genome of interest only and comparative_genomics metrics that use alignments of orthologous regions in the genomes of related species among the comparative_methods benchmarked in our previous study one of our original contributions was the codon substitution frequencies csf metric which assigns a score to each codon substitution observed in the input alignment based on the relative
