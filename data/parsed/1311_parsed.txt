structural_bioinformatics delphi web_server v incorporating atomic style geometrical figures into the computational protocol a new edition of the delphi web_server delphi web_server v is released to include atomic presentation of geometrical figures these geometrical objects can be used to model nano size objects together with real biological_macromolecules the position and size of the object can be manipulated by the user in real_time until desired results are achieved the server fixes structural_defects adds hydrogen_atoms and calculates electrostatic energies and the corresponding electrostatic_potential and ionic distributions availability_and the web_server follows a client server architecture built on php and html and utilizes delphi software the computation is carried_out on supercomputer cluster and results are given back to the user via http protocol including the ability to visualize the structure and corresponding electrostatic_potential via jmol implementation the delphi web_server is available fromelectrostatics play a profound role in molecular_biology due to biological_macromolecules being made of thousands millions of atoms with different size and partial charge situated at short distances the importance of electrostatic_interactions and energies is illustrated by the fact that many biological_phenomena are predominantly electrostatic in origin as is salt dependence of binding and folding phdependence and pka shifts in proteins and rnas the main obstacle in modeling electrostatics in biological_systems is the presence of water here we utilize a particular resource delphi version which is based on the continuum approach and solves the poissonboltzmann equation pbe via the finite_difference algorithm we developed a delphi web_server which is aimed to provide easy access to performing electrostatic calculations in biological_systems without prior_knowledge and without having a computational infrastructure in place to whom correspondence should be addressed in addition with the progress of nano technology researchers frequently aim at modeling hybrid_systems comprised of nanoobjects and biological_macromolecules as proteins deposited on a dielectric plate membranes probed with the tip of an atomic_force interactions of amino_acids with spherical_nanoparticles and many others however currently there is no available software and web_server capable of modeling such hybrid_systems a web_server utilizing apbs to solve pbe in systems comprising of protein and water was recently reported to address this need we have developed the next generation of delphi web_server v which allows the users to create nano objects change their position and shape in real_time and carry out electrostatic calculations in the presence of biological_macromolecules the above algorithms were implemented using c code for flexibility and speed and were incorporated into the delphi web_server see_supplementary for more details the geometrical object can be generated by selecting yes for the option do you wish to create objects at the file upload and input parameter form for delphi runpage once this option is selected the user is given the choice to create four different types of geometrical figures sphere cylinder cone and parallelepiped upon choosing a particular geometrical figure a new window appears showing the geometrical shape positioned in a cartesian reference_frame the same figure provides a set of indicators detailing what the input_parameters are for this particular shape the user should then enter the required parameters that define the position and dimensions of the appropriate geometrical shape in addition the user can also enter the desired dielectric_constant for the object which can vary from the proteins dielectric_constant this allows the modeling of various systems including biological_macromolecules and nano objects that have variegated dielectric_properties the positioning of the geometrical object from the manually entered parameters may not correspond to the desired location of the object due to the offset of the origin in crystallographic structures which is not at to allow the users to further refine the position dimensions and shape of the corresponding geometrical object in the delphi web_server the object_manipulation for the combined protein object pdb_file has been enhanced with real_time manipulation of the object using javascript sliders coupled with the jmol applet such an implementation is very useful because it shows a skeleton of the objects new positioning and dimensions output screen of the delphi web_server showing a protein and the corresponding geometrical object with the potential mapped onto the combined surface protein object and thus helps users to orient the object exactly this object can then be generated and re rendered to show the exact location and size of the object as a final confirmation for the user before the job is processed with delphi the adjustment of the objects position dimensions and shape can be repeated as many times as desired until the appropriate orientation is found the next page of the web_server offers various output options including which components of the electrostatic energy need to be calculated and what output_files are to be generated as potential or dielectric maps or site potential files then the input_files and selected options are transferred to clemsons supercomputer cluster the palmetto high_performance facility http www clemson edu ccit rsch computing once the jobs are completed the user receives email notification that the job is finished along with id number and a link by clicking on the link the user is directed to the delphi web_server download and visualization page on this page the user is presented with several ways to download the results the protonated and fixed pdb files and the parameter files used in this particular job in addition the page utilizes jmol if the user had requested a potential map to be calculated then the potential map in cube format is also available for download and for visualization by clicking on the potential map file the page then maps the potential onto the molecular_surface of the corresponding biological macromolecule the potential levels and the color scheme can be manipulated by the user for visualization purposes by using the jmol applet the d structure mapped with the electrostatic_potential can be rotated and zoomed in if necessary demonstrates the output capabilities of delphi web_server it shows a particular protein the clic protein being deposited on or probed with the four geometrical objects described in this article it can be seen that the objects surface is quite smooth indicating the atomic style representation provides a very good approximation of solid objects the protein was modeled with a dielectric_constant of and the objects with a dielectric_constant of it can also be seen that in some cases the object penetrates inside the protein on purpose such a scenario can be used to model a membrane_protein inserted into membrane slab illustrates the case of a protein touching a cylindrical rod which can be a fiber wire or another nano object shows a protein deposited on a spherical nano particle lastly demonstrates a cone protein complex which can be viewed as the tip of atomic_force that has already passed through the protein in terms of the calculated energies the atomic style representation of the objects was tested against the original implementation of the geometrical shapes in delphi and it was found that the results in terms of the solvation_energy are consistent within
