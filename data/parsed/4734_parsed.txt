treeefm calculating elementary_flux using linear optimization in a tree based algorithm motivation elementary_flux efms analysis constitutes a fundamental tool in systems_biology however the efficient calculation of efms in genome_scale gsmns is still a challenge we present a novel algorithm that uses a linear_programming based tree search and efficiently enumerates a subset of efms in gsmns results our approach is compared with the efmevolver approach demonstrating a significant_improvement in computation time we also validate the usefulness of our new approach by studying the acetate overflow metabolism in the escherichia_coli bacteria to do so we computed million efms for each energetic amino_acid and then analysed the relevance of each energetic amino_acid based on gene protein expression data and the obtained efms we found good agreement between previous_experiments and the conclusions reached using efms finally we also analysed the performance of our approach when applied to large gsmns availability_and the stand alone software treeefm is implemented in c and interacts with the open_source linear solver coin or linear_program solver clp many advances in medicine and biology would not be possible without a detailed understanding of the functional mechanisms of cellular_metabolism however this is a very complex task as there are intricate regulatory_events controlling cellular response novel technologies referred to with the suffix omics are emerging in the last two decades and providing us with a cellular picture of unprecedented coverage and resolution unfortunately it is often difficult to detect the mechanisms behind an observed alteration using the data provided by omics_technologies the scientific_community needs improved tools and methods to identify these mechanisms in different scenarios several mathematical_methods modeling metabolism are emerging that are able to incorporate datasets provided by different omics_technologies many of these methods are encompassed within constraint_based in which a set of mathematical constraints are defined using a genome_scale gsmn reconstruction as a starting_point several curated gsmns can be found in the literature however being able to automatically characterize the biochemical_reactions present in a particular metabolism through omics_data truly constitutes a challenge typically constraint_based account for two principal constraints namely the mass_balance equation at steady_state andthermodynamic based irreversibility constraints if given a set of enzymes all of them are essential to fulfill these two constraints the set is referred to as an elementary_flux efm in other words efms are solutions with the minimum support necessary to operate in stoichiometric steady_state balance with all reactions in the appropriate direction the advantages of analysing metabolic_networks based on efms have been shown in different works e g however their use has been limited because enumerating them is computationally_demanding algorithms have been developed to enumerate all the efms in medium_size metabolic_networks von however despite the development of novel methods using state of the art computational_techniques expediting their application in larger_networks this family of algorithms fails on gsmns using standard computers because of the combinatorial explosion in the number of efms in this light several methods have been recently_proposed to determine a subset of efms in gsmns continuing with this effort we present here a novel algorithm that uses a linear_programming based tree search for efm numeration denoted as treeefm we benchmark the performance of our new approach with efmevolver currently the most efficient framework to find efms in gsmns the results show that treeefm outperforms efmevolver after confirming the efficiency of the new approach presented here we calculate a large set of efms to study a relevant biological_question the acetate overflow metabolism the aerobic production of acetate causes serious economic_losses in bacteria based biofactories finding the mechanisms that prevent this scenario constitutes an open question in the field here we analyse the relevance of eight energetic amino_acids in the overflow metabolism using our approach to compute a large set of efms we then apply the methodology_presented into score each efm based on expression data using the gene protein expression data provided by on the basis of a literature_review we could validate the conclusions reached using efms finally we analysed the performance of our approach for handling even larger_networks than traditional gsmns paving the way for forthcoming models involving an ever increasing number of reactions and metabolites the methodology_presented here based on linear_programming and an efficient tree search_procedure is a general one for enumerating extreme points in a polytope in this work we focused on the computation of efms our approach showed a computational advantage with respect to efmevolver which is a key issue in the analysis of gsmns involving thousands of reactions
