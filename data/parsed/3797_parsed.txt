pvaas identify variants associated with aberrant_splicing from rna_seq motivation rna_seq has been widely used to study the transcriptome comparing to microarray sequencing based rna_seq is able to identify splicing variants and single_nucleotide in one experiment simultaneously this provides unique_opportunity to detect_variants that associated with aberrant_splicing despite the popularity of rna_seq no bioinformatics tool has been developed to leverage this advantage to identify variants associated with aberrant_splicing results we have developed pvaas a tool to identify single_nucleotide that associated with aberrant alternative_splicing from rna_seq pvaas works in three steps i identify aberrant splicings ii use user provided variants or perform variant_calling iii assess the significance of association between variants and aberrant splicing_events availability_and pvaas is written in python and c source_code and a comprehensive users manual are freely_available at http pvaas sourceforge net alternative pre messenger rna_splicing is the primary mechanism to increase protein diversity in eukaryote in humans of multi exon genes are alternatively_spliced on the other hand this tightly_regulated sophisticated nuclear process is also a natural_source of disease_causing errors genetic_mutations in splice_sites or other cis regulatory_sites such as exonic splicing enhancer or ese can impair the splicing process and lead to aberrantly spliced transcripts aberrant splicings are increasingly_recognized as responsible for human disease it is estimated that of disease_causing affect splicing l pez despite the importance of aberrant_splicing in disease development and progression little work has been done to identity the causal_mutations that are directly associated with aberrant_splicing in genome_scale the sequencing of the transcriptome using high_throughput provides a unique_opportunity to study the association between single_nucleotide snvs and splice_variants first rna_seq experiment is able to simultaneously identify aberrant splicing_events and snvs a clear advantage compared with microarrays second spliced reads i e reads that spanning exonexon junctions provide physical evidence of the association between variants and certain isoforms to our knowledge no bioinformatics tool is currently available to characterize this association we have developed pvaas a program to detect snvs that are associated with aberrant alternative_splicing from rna_seq directly it efficiently handles large_scale data with hundreds of millions of alignments
