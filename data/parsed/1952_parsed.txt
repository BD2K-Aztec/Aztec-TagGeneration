genetics_and genalex genetic_analysis in excel population_genetic software for teaching and research an update genalex genetic_analysis in excel is a cross_platform package for population_genetic that runs within microsoft_excel genalex offers analysis of diploid codominant haploid and binary genetic_loci and dna_sequences both frequency based f statistics heterozygosity hwe population assignment related ness and distance based amova pcoa mantel tests multivariate spatial_autocorrelation analyses are provided new features include calculation of new estimators of population_structure g st g st josts d est and f st through amova shannon information analysis linkage_disequilibrium for biallelic data and novel heterogen eity tests for spatial_autocorrelation analysis export to more than other data_formats is provided teaching tutorials and expanded step_by output options are included the comprehensive guide has been fully revised availability_and genalex is written in vba and provided as a microsoft excelgenalex was originally developed as a teaching tool to facilitate teaching population genetic_analysis at the graduate level genalex operates within microsoft excelthe widely used spreadsheet software that forms part of the cross_platform microsoft office suite packaging genetic_analysis within a familiar and flexible environment resulted in quick understanding and effective performance of population_genetic taking_advantage of the rich graphical options available within excel genalex offers a wide_range of graphical outputs that aid genetic data analysis and interpretation genalex is now widely used by university teachers at both undergraduate and graduate levels around the world moreover the software has also attracted a large number of researchers who utilize its unique features here we provide an update on the new features offered in genalex that we believe will be welcomed by students teachers and researchers genalex offers population genetic_analysis of diploid codominant haploid haplotypic and binary genetic data from animals plants and microorganisms it accommodates a wide_range of genetic_markers including microsatellites ssrs singlenucleotide polymorphisms snps amplified fragment length polymorphisms and dna_sequences both allele frequencybased and distance based analysis options are provided the former includes estimates of heterozygosity and genetic_diversity f statistics neis genetic_distance population assignment and relatedness the latter includes analysis of molecular variance amova principal coordinates analysis pcoa mantel tests twogener multivariate and d spatial_autocorrelation readers are referred to peakall and smouse for a more comprehensive outline of these standard_procedures data_formats and data import options genalex maintains backward compatibility but it provides access to the expanded spreadsheet of excel onward thus the maximum numbers of loci and samples are vastly expanded and only constrained by memory more than different excel graphs summarize the outcomes of genetic_analyses graphics can be further manipulated with excel options and easily converted to pdf or other publication quality formats
