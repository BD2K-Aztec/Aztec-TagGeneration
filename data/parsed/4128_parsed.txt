sbtab a flexible table format for data_exchange in systems_biology sbtab is a table based data format for systems_biology designed to support automated data_integration and model_building it uses the structure of spreadsheets and defines conventions for table structure controlled_vocabularies and semantic annotations the format comes with pre defined table types for experimental_data and sbml compliant model structures and can easily be customized to cover new types of data availability_and sbtab documents can be created and edited with any text editor or spreadsheet tool the website www sbtab net provides online tools for syntax validation and conversion to sbml and html as well as software for using sbtab in ms excel matlab and r the stand alone python code contains functions for file parsing validation conversion to sbml and html and an interface to sqlite databases to be integrated into systems_biology workflows a detailed specification of sbtab including examples and descriptions of table types and available tools can be found at www sbtab net data_exchange between experimental and computational_biologists plays_a in systems_biology the scientific_community has developed a range of standard formats for data and models that facilitate this exchange and increase software interoperability prominent examples are the systems_biology sbml for the exchange of mathematical_models the systems_biology sbgn for standardized drawings of biological_networks and the investigation study assay format isa tab a standard spreadsheet format for experimental_data and metadata standards facilitate automated file parsing and guarantee that files contain complete and unambiguous information which makes research results better comprehensible and reproducible standardized formats are often not designed to be human_readable but rather written and read by software this makes it harder for users without particular technical knowledge or software skills to employ them efficiently an alternative approach to fostering data_exchange is to provide guidelines for minimal information requirements as demonstrated by the miriam rules for published models of systems_biology these rules specify minimal pieces of model information that must be provided to ensure that model_simulations can be reliably reproduced by other researchers such rules ensure complete and unambigous information while placing less restrictions on modellers than the aforementioned standardized file_formats despite these efforts the usage of standard formats has not been fully established at the interface of experimental and computational_systems at this interface complex models need to be constructed from heterogeneous data types descriptions of network v c the author published_by
