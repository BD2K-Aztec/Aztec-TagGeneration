data_and lipid data analyzer unattended identification and quantitation of lipids in lc_ms data motivation the accurate measurement of the lipidome permits insights into physiological_and of the present high_throughput lc_ms especially bears potential of monitoring quantitative changes in hundreds of lipids simultaneously in order to extract valuable information from huge amount of mass_spectrometry data the aid of automated reliable highly_sensitive analysis algorithms is indispensable results we present here a novel approach for the quantitation of lipids in lc_ms data the new algorithm obtains its analytical power by two major innovations i a d algorithm that confines the peak borders in m z and time direction and ii the use of the theoretical isotopic distribution of an analyte as selection exclusion_criterion the algorithm is integrated in the lipid data analyzer lda application which additionally provides standardization a statistics module for results analysis a batch mode for unattended analysis of several runs and a d viewer for the manual verification the statistics module offers sample grouping tests between sample groups and export functionalities where the results are visualized by heat maps and bar charts the presented algorithm has been applied to data from a controlled experiment and to biological data containing analytes distributed over an intensity range of our approach shows improved_sensitivity and an extremely_high positive_predictive compared with existing_methods consequently the novel algorithm integrated in a user_friendly application is a valuable improvement in the high_throughput analysis of the lipidome implementation and availability the java_application is freely_available users atadvances in lipidomics technologies utilizing mass_spectrometry have led to a rapid increase in the number size and rate at which datasets are generated lc_ms especially bears the potential for monitoring quantitative changes in hundreds of lipids simultaneously in order to deal with the acquired data automated and reliable software_tools are required currently available lipidomics ms quantitation tools can be classified in two groups each extracting d subsets of ms data one group requires m z profiles or m z spectra and the other group extracts chromatograms for quantitation a representative of the first group is limsa which can analyse m z spectra only it utilizes an additional program secd to extract the m z spectra the user has to define manually a trapezoid in the m z time map of the lc_ms data containing the lipid series of interest a collection of lipids having the same amount of c atoms this extracted m z spectra serve as input for the limsa algorithm in contrast mzmine a program from the second group provides several algorithms to automatically extract chromatograms for processing both programs select the peaks for an analyte based on the exact m z value however an lc_ms peak is a d object whereupon each of its data_points is characterized by retention time m z ratio and intensity consequently all of the available tools lose information from a whole dimension in the first group by the m z profile extraction and the other group by the chromatogram extraction and thus decrease the ability to clearly distinguish between closely overlapping peaks furthermore overlapping peaks occur frequently in lipidomic data due to the particular nature of lipids the chemical_structures of lipids can differ just by one double_bond resulting in a mass difference of da between the analytes thus the base peak isotope of the analyte has almost the same mass as the second isotopic peak isotope of the analyte with one additional double_bond furthermore elution times are usually very close due to the physicochemical similarity of the analytes in this article we present a novel algorithm that addresses the difficulties specific to lipidomics ms data quantitation by two novel approaches i exact peak border confinement and ii accounting for the theoretical isotopic distribution for peak selection the novel border confinement increases the ability to detect overlaps and reduces their effects the theoretical isotopic distribution isshows the d view at the top of the picture and the d chromatogram view at the bottom in the d view the isotopic peaks and of tg and tg plus the peak of tg are depicted whereupon the peaks stained in red correspond to the quantified peaks of tg the d view shows the extracted chromatogram at the m z value of tg in the chromatogram the overlapping isotopic peak of tg is not distinguishable from the main_peak of resulting in one peak b shows the zoomed d view of the overlap of the peak of tg with the peak of tg in d the two peaks are clearly discernable the red stained part of the overlapping peaks indicates the part that has been used for the quantitation of tg used as an exclusion and selection criterion and as such increases specificity these two principles allow accurate and highly_specific peak identification which is required for the unattended highthroughput analysis of lipids to assess the performance of the new algorithm we i conducted a controlled experiment to test the accuracy of the quantitation and ii applied the algorithm to biological data to test its sensitivity and positive_predictive the lda proved to be a powerful and reliable tool for highthroughput analysis of the lipidome using lc_ms in a controlled experiment we showed that the results are more accurate than with other available tools average deviation from the ideal ratio was for lda for mzmine and for limsa moreover on biological data the novel algorithm proved its real strength the sensitivity increased from to and the positive_predictive from to
