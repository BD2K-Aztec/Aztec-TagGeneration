genome_analysis cytohic a cytoscape_plugin for visual comparison of hi c networks withthe development of the hi c technique byintroduced revolutionary concepts to the research of genome_organization a following analysis suggested a fractal globule organization at mb resolution where loci interact within intra and between inter chromosomes since then significant efforts were made to remove bias and normalize the data to identify governing features such as ccctc factor and binding_sites and to suggest the role of nuclear architecture in regulation and translocation events hi c data can be considered as an end result of dissembling a puzzle or shuttering a globe into small pieces and reporting the pieces that were found together normalization_methods attempt to remove biases and in turn report a corrected contact value between the different pieces assembling back the pieces or genomic bins into the underlying spatial map is an important challenge the ability to view and compare hi c maps as spatial networks with respect to genomic landmarks of interest can provide_important about the properties dynamics and role of the nuclear organization through visual comparison researchers can instantly identify what has changed and what has remained conserved between different hi c datasets one may be interested in comparing the interaction map of orthologs or view the spatial changes through a progress of a disease or through developmental_stages comparison of cells with different functions may reveal common and cell specific spatial arrangements finally comparing the same hi c dataset under different normalization_methods or before and after normalization has been performed can aid in assessing differences in coverage and correction we have developed cytohic a plugin for the cytoscape platform for generating and visually comparing spatial maps from normalized hi c data cytohic provides a user_friendly interface for uploading hi c data and genomic landmarks and exploits the visualization power of cytoscape to draw the corresponding spatial maps its implementation was designed to allow for easy identification of spatial changes and for visual integration of related properties such as methylation and gene_expression as a cytoscape_plugin cytohic also makes it easier to combine and convey multi omic information to the best of our knowledge cytohic is the first tool developed for the task of an interactive visual comparison of hi c data cytohic is a platform independent easy to install plugin for cytoscape it offers visual_exploration and comparison so users can instantly and easily observe trends and changes in the spatial environment of genomic landmarks users may explore spatial changes from evolutionary functional developmental and clinical point of views as hi c data take its important place in the research of nuclear architecture visual_exploration applications such as cytohic become an important part of the required toolbox while the spatial networks generated by cytohic provide the user an approximation for physical proximity based on interaction frequencies we hope to offer better methods for predicting the nuclear positions of landmarks and to fix coverage and correction errors in the future incorporation of such methods with a visualization_tool can provide a more accurate representation of the nucleus topological map
