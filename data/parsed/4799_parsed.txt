sequence_analysis unraveling the outcome of s rdna based taxonomy analysis through mock data and simulations motivation s rdna pyrosequencing is a powerful approach that requires extensive usage of computational_methods for delineating microbial compositions previously it was shown that outcomes of studies relying on this approach vastly depend on the choice of pre_processing and clustering_algorithms used however obtaining insights into the effects and accuracy of these algorithms is challenging due to difficulties in generating samples of known composition with high enough diversity here we use in silico microbial datasets to better understand how the experimental_data are transformed into taxonomic clusters by computational_methods results we were able to qualitatively replicate the raw experimental pyrosequencing_data after rigorously adjusting existing simulation software this allowed us to simulate datasets of real_life complexity which we used to assess the influence and performance of two widely used pre_processing methods along with clustering_algorithms we show that the choice order and mode of the pre_processing methods have a larger impact on the accuracy of the clustering pipeline than the clustering_methods themselves without pre_processing the difference between the performances of clustering_methods is large depending on the clustering_algorithm the most optimal analysis_pipeline resulted in significant underestimations of the expected number of clusters minimum maximum allowing us to make quantitative estimations of the bacterial complexity of real microbiome samples contact a may vu nl or b brandt acta nl supplementary_information supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online the simulated_datasets are available via http www ibi vu nl downloads rapidly improving next_generation have rendered s rdna amplicon_sequencing a standard approach to explore the composition and dynamics of complex microbial_communities the accurate identification of bacteria and discovery of new species with this approach help describe in unprecedented detail the hitherto_unknown biodiversity in environments such as ocean water and soil on a broader scale simultaneous sequencing of internal_transcribed s and s rdna amplicons has led to the successful characterization of bacterial archaeal and eukaryotic microorganisms within a clinical context this technique provides novel insights into the relationship between the health_status of the host and associated microbiome for example the human_gut or oral_cavity a typical s rdna based profiling study involves pcr_amplification of one or more hypervariable_regions hvrs of microbial s rrna_genes followed by massively_parallel because incomplete s rdna databases limit reference based taxonomic_classification a common approach is to perform a taxonomy independent analysis tia where the sequences reads are compared with each other and are clustered into operational_taxonomic otus conventionally similarity for species level clustering the number and sizes of the resulting otus describe the diversity in the sample among next_generation that are suitable for amplicon_sequencing pyrosequencing has possibly been the most popular technique due to its relatively long_reads and sufficient sampling depth nevertheless sample diversity and structure estimates based on this procedure are affected by a number of factors including the dna_extraction method choice of primers copy_number presence of chimeric or non target_sequences sequencing_errors and otu clustering among these detecting chimeric sequences and correcting sequencing_errors have perhaps been the most successfully addressed issues by computational means resulting in a number of algorithms for data pre_processing that incorporate these corrective steps the removal of such artifacts is key to avoiding accumulation of spurious records in databases more importantly recent_studies stress the necessity of data pre_treatment by pointing out that diversity estimates differ orders_of depending on the pre_processing procedure used however conclusive reports on how these methods work to whom correspondence should be addressed on a representative scale are limited due to the absence of ground_truth in complex environmental datasets following pre_processing accurate clustering of reads into otus facilitates the recovery of the community_composition in the sample however numerous clustering_methods used for tia such as single_linkage or furthest linkage hierarchical_clustering have been reported to yield considerably different results and even small changes in algorithm parameters within individual methods can lead to vast differences in addition differences in clustering_algorithms such as different criteria for the ordering of input_sequences or the calculation of distance_matrices are likely to yield different clustering outcomes the evaluation of the various data treatment and clustering_methods and their use on real_datasets have hitherto been limited to in vitro mock studies where sample diversities are typically at least an order of magnitude less compared with those in real_life situations such limitations of in vitro studies have led to the development of simulation software such as metasim and grinder which are capable of generating complex sequence_datasets these packages which do not produce the specific standard flowgram format can be complemented by flowsim or sim to simulate flowgrams the pyrosequencing output nevertheless some aspects of s rdna pyrosequencing are not amenable to implementation in simulations or cannot be incorporated at all these include pcr efficiency primer bias s rdna copy_number and realistic read quality_scores here using in silico datasets we aimed to provide an independent assessment of the accuracy and effects of computational_techniques on delineating compositions of complex microbial_communities using s rdna pyrosequencing we analyzed two low complexity experimental_datasets and derived data characteristics which were then used to simulate datasets that are likely to mimic real_life complexity we applied two widely used data pre processing_tools followed by clustering_algorithms on these datasets and evaluated the accuracy of the resulting clusters using the normalized_mutual nmi score and the number of otus formed the overall experimental_design is shown in we show that pre_processing methods have a larger impact on the results of the tia pipeline than the clustering_methods themselves without pre_processing clustering_methods were found to yield considerably different outcomes the workflow that yielded the best agreement with the expected number of clusters resulted in significant underestimations of the expected number of otus depending on the clustering_algorithm used we conclude with a discussion on how these new findings can be projected to earlier_studies that describe the microbial complexity in human saliva_samples we first analyzed two in vitro datasets from a small mock community using simulation packages we then replicated this mock community in silico and compared the results with the in vitro data after verifying that the simulation parameters were set appropriately we simulated two groups of more complex datasets to uncover the effects and accuracy of computational_methods on a realistic scale
