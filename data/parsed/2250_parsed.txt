genome_analysis hybridspades an algorithm for hybrid assembly of short and long_reads motivation recent_advances in single_molecule real_time smrt and nanopore sequencing_technologies have enabled high_quality assemblies from long and inaccurate reads however these approaches require high coverage by long_reads and remain expensive on the other hand the inexpensive short_reads technologies produce accurate but fragmented assemblies thus a hybrid_approach that assembles long_reads with low coverage and short_reads has a potential to generate high_quality assemblies at reduced_cost results we describe hybridspades algorithm for assembling short and long_reads and benchmark it on a variety of bacterial assembly projects our results demonstrate that hybridspades generates accurate assemblies even in projects with relatively low coverage by long_reads thus reducing the overall cost of genome_sequencing we further present the first complete assembly of a genome from single cells using smrt_reads availability_and hybridspades is implemented in c as a part of spades genome assembler and is publicly_available atwhile de_novo sequencing from long and inaccurate smrt_reads results in accurate assemblies these projects require high coverage of a genome by reads and thus remain expensive moreover for oxford nanopore technology with even higher_error than in smrt_reads accurate de_novo assemblies remain challenging even in high_coverage projects for example the highest reported accuracy of assemblies from oxford nanopore reads is significantly below the acceptable standards for finished genomes on the other hand recently_developed hybrid approaches for assembling long and inaccurate and short and accurate reads proved to be useful in generating high_quality assemblies at a relatively low_cost in some complex applications e g metagenomics and single_cell genomics the hybrid approaches may represent an attractive alternative to de_novo for long_reads we describe hybridspadesa hybrid assembly approach that benefits from synergy between accurate short and error_prone long_reads hybridspades uses the same algorithms for both pacific_biosciences reads about error_rate and oxford nanopore reads an even higher_error e g recently hybridspades was applied to studies of bacterial plankton using assembly of illumina and pacific_biosciences reads and for analyzing antibiotics resistance using assembly of illumina and oxford nanopore reads we benchmark hybridspades against other hybrid assembly tools and demonstrate that it enables accurate assemblies even in the case when the number of long_reads is relatively small we further show that hybridspades works well even in the difficult case of single_cell genome_assembly resulting in the complete circular chromosome assembly of the elusive candidate phylum tm that remains uncultivated
