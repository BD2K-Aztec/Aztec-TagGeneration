systems_biology computing biological_functions using bio a formal description of biological_processes based on elementary bricks of actions motivation in the available databases biological_processes are described from molecular and cellular points of view but these descriptions are represented with text annotations that make it difficult to handle them for computation consequently there is an obvious need for formal descriptions of biological_processes results we present a formalism that uses the bio concepts to model biological_processes from molecular_details to networks this computational_approach based on elementary bricks of actions allows us to calculate on biological_functions e g process comparison mapping structurefunction relationships etc we illustrate its application with two examples the functional comparison of proteases and the functional description of the glycolysis network this computational_approach is compatible with detailed biological_knowledge and can be applied to different kinds of systems of simulation the identification of the biological_functions of all genes and gene_products and the understanding of how they interact to yield a living_cell is still a challenge for post genomic biology despite the fact that a huge amount of detailed information on molecular_functions has been accumulated by biologists indeed such detailed functional knowledge is poorly accessible for biocomputing since it is not or rarely formalized and it is often partial on the other hand the biological_systems modelling community has developed robust formalisms in which molecular_processes can be implemented in a very simplified way the notion of biological_function of a given molecule is very complex because it can vary depending on the environment in addition different meanings can be given to this concept based on the level of abstraction chosen by the user molecular cellular etc consequently the functions of gene_products have been described in many different ways over the years to whom correspondence should be addressed there is however a need to establish and use a common reference for functional_annotations current databases describe processes from a molecular and cellular point_of but they use text annotations which make it difficult to handle them thus to calculate with functional_annotations one would require a formal description of such biological_processes in this context we use the term to calculate to describe the action of computing with biological_processes as we do with sequences i e to do process comparisons evolution additions etc or to simulate dynamic combinations of processes in different environments such a task is obviously difficult and existing classifications and ontologies are not sufficient to provide a description compatible with comparison modelling and simulation of sophisticated processes this is due to the fact that the available classifications have intrinsic limitations because they do not take into account the environment elements of action shared between two functions etc for example gene_ontology go is becoming the standard in the field of classification of terms associated with biological_processes although very useful the description of biological_processes in go is limited to tagging molecules with standardized terms that are hierarchically classified likewise the hierarchic enzyme commission ec nomenclature system ec_number is used to classify enzyme_reactions it defines and categorizes catalysed reactions but often the relation between ec_number and enzyme is ambiguous indeed a given enzymatic complex can sometimes be characterized not by a global ec_number but by several ec numbers because it contains several active sub units that participate in different activities e g the pyruvate_dehydrogenase as each of them catalyses a different reaction alternatively the association of different polypeptides may be required to catalyse a given reaction and they will be all catalogued under a single ec_number i e citrate_synthase moreover a mono domain enzyme has only one ec_number whereas it can have different actions in different contexts thus there are different ec numbers for enzymes that have similar actions and the ec_number cannot always represent properly the entire spectrum of enzymatic processes it is worth noting that biological_processes are many and heterogeneous and most of them can be decomposed into combinations of more simple processes in which a process can be performed by part of a protein domain a single protein or a network thus biological_processes have to be described at different levels of abstraction moreover the same process can be performed by different proteins depending on the context as a consequence it would be an advantage to describe processes in a generic form for this it is necessary to take into account theto compute with biological_functions we need a formalism that on one hand can integrate part of the complexity of the existing knowledge and on the other hand can allow us to make calculations with biological_processes the biological_knowledge on functions is wide and very heterogeneous but very little is available in databases about such biological_processes despite the fact that a considerable wealth of annotations exist on the biological objects proteins nas small_molecules etc that support such processes in others words we know more about the players of a process than about the process itself in addition descriptions of functions and bioobjects are often confusing bio clearly separates process description and bioobject description and focuses on the different levels going from the chemical sub molecular and molecular_entities to the network level all other existing function_annotations do not or only partially address this view bio is based on the integration of all these levels and it could extend to additional levels if required we described bea at the chemical level which can be considered as the elementary bricks that compose all functions in nature beas fall into four classes and their relationships with ec are available at biodb http www sysdiag cnrs fr publications supplementary_materials biopsi manager obviously the description of elementary actions provides a generic view of a biological_process it can be used as an element of comparison to integrate available knowledge on functions we can complement the description of a biological_process with parameters such as substrate_specificity kinetics conditionality of the process execution based on contextual_information ph temperature etc these parameters can be global i e temperature or local to
