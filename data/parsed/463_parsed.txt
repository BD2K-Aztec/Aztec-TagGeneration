aracne ap gene network reverse_engineering through adaptive partitioning inference of mutual_information the accurate reconstruction of gene_regulatory from large_scale molecular_profile datasets represents one of the grand challenges of systems_biology the algorithm for the reconstruction of accurate cellular_networks aracne represents one of the most effective tools to accomplish this goal however the initial fixed bandwidth fb implementation is both inefficient and unable to deal with sample_sets providing largely uneven coverage of the probability density space here we present a completely new implementation of the algorithm based on an adaptive partitioning strategy ap for estimating the mutual_information the new ap implementation aracne ap achieves a dramatic_improvement in computational performance on average over the previous methodology while preserving the mutual_information estimator and the network_inference accuracy of the original algorithm given that the previous version of aracne is extremely demanding the new version of the algorithm will allow even researchers with modest computational_resources to build complex_regulatory from hundreds of gene_expression availability_and a java cross_platform command_line executable of aracne together with all source_code and a detailed usage guide are freely_available on sourceforge http sourceforge net_projects aracne ap java version or higher is required we and others have shown that the accurate and systematic dissection of tissue gene_regulatory reverse_engineering represents a crucial step in the elucidation of drivers and mechanisms presiding over both physiologic and pathologic phenotypes many computational_approaches have been proposed for the reverse_engineering of gene_regulatory from large_scale gene_expression data most of these require estimating pairwise gene_functions such as pearson spearman_correlation mutual_information mi and linear lasso_regression amongst others aracne represents one of the most widely used reverse_engineering algorithms by the scientific_community and has been extensively experimentally_validated aracne uses an information_theoretic framework based on the data_processing inequality theorem to infer direct regulatory_relationships between transcriptional_regulator proteins and target_genes aracne has been shown to be useful in the reconstruction of context specific transcriptional_networks in multiple tissue_types several additional algorithms have emerged which rely on v c the author published_by
