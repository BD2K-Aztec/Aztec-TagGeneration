systems_biology automated analysis of time lapse fluorescence microscopy_images from live_cell images to intracellular foci motivation complete accurate and reproducible analysis of intracellular foci from fluorescence_microscopy image_sequences of live cells requires full automation of all processing_steps involved cell segmentation and tracking followed by foci segmentation and pattern analysis integrated_systems for this purpose are lacking results extending our previous work in cell segmentation and tracking we developed a new system for performing fully_automated analysis of fluorescent foci in single cells the system was validated by applying it to two common tasks intracellular foci counting in dna_damage experiments and cell phase identification based on foci pattern analysis in dna_replication experiments experimental_results show that the system performs comparably to expert human_observers thus it may replace tedious manual analyses for the considered tasks and enables high_content availability_and the described system was implemented in matlab the mathworks inc usa and compiled to run within the matlab environment the routines together with four sample datasets are available at http celmia bigr nl the software is planned for public release free of charge for non commercial use after publication of this article the ability to perform analyses on individual cells presents evident advantages over the traditional averaging over the whole cell_population in many studies such analyses are mainly performed_manually which is very tedious and often lacks accuracy completeness and reproducibility to improve this automated methods are essential in this article we present a new system for performing intracellular analysis in time lapse fluorescence_microscopy image data of cell colonies the system consists of two main modules cell analysis and foci analysis the first is more generic and can be applied to a large variety of biological data acquired for cell analysis the second is naturally a to whom correspondence should be addressed more application dependent step and requires specialized methods depending on the structures of interest a number of cell segmentation and tracking algorithms have been presented in the recent_literature and the references therein however very few can potentially satisfy the requirements imposed by live_cell and analysis at the individual cell level specifically a candidate algorithm should have the capability to handle d timelapse image datasets it should provide full segmentation detection only is insufficient and tracking be able to handle cell_divisions and show good performance even in the presence of significant noise and inhomogeneous intensity distributions whether in the background or within cells to this end we use our robust level set based cell segmentation and tracking algorithm as a starting_point here we present an extension of the algorithm that allows registration of each cell to a common coordinate system by applying motion correction after segmentation and tracking this is necessary to study the true relative dynamics of intracellular_processes as for the subsequent step of intracellular analysis we focus here on fluorescent foci which appear in many biological studies representing high_concentrations of the corresponding fluorescently_labeled protein foci are usually the main indicator of an underlying biological_process occurring at these locations consequently this makes foci analysis the main tool for studying protein related processes by means of fluorescence_microscopy examples of biological_research based on foci analysis include fluorescent_in fish experiments analysis of dna_replication and repair and classification of cell_cycle in this article we present a novel foci segmentation_algorithm and evaluate its robustness in segmenting foci of different size and intensity as well as clustered foci in addition to presenting the algorithms used in different steps we also validate the complete system by showing its ability to reproduce findings from two biological studies that were based on expert manual analyses in the first experiment we investigate the time course of nuclear_foci formation and disappearance upon treatment with ionizing_radiation of the bp dna_repair the sample images inillustrate that the cell colonies were densely clustered and that some of the nuclei showed very irregular shapes as imaged together with the relatively low and inhomogeneous contrast and a considerable amount of noise this makes automated_segmentation challenging nevertheless in all the images our system was able to yield satisfactory segmentations for subsequent foci analysis next automatic foci counting was performed and the results were compared to manual counts by an expert human_observer to make a fair comparison for each image we selected the same number of segmented cells as considered by the human expert in the manual_analysis by applying a size threshold in total cells were selected for automatic foci counting of which contained foci and were identified as positive foci two measures were calculated for each time point the percentage of positive cells and the average number of foci per cell the results clearly show that the automatically obtained results are in good agreement with the results obtained by manual_analysis both qualitatively_and in particular for both measures the calculated general trend is virtually the same the plots inshow the differences in the phase_transition times as found by our system versus both observers for each of the four possible phase_transitions the results clearly confirm in agreement with that it is much easier to distinguish the g and g phases from the s phase figs and a d than to distinguish between the different subphases of the s phase figs and b c for the transitions from g to early s and from late s to g the absolute_differences in the times detected by our system versus any of the two observers did not exceed time points which is the same as the maximum_difference found between the two observers for the transitions from early s and middle s and from middle s to late s the maximum absolute_difference between our system and any of the observers was time points which again is equal to the maximum_difference found between the two observers in most cases the differences with respect to the two observers showed_opposite signs meaning that the automatically detected transition time was in between the times indicated by the observers or one of the differences was relatively small indicating that the automatically detected time point was close to that found by one of the observers however there were also several cases where our algorithm showed considerable difference with both observers while their results were in good agreement an important observation following from these cases is that the results were much better closer to those of the observers for sequences where more transitions ideally all four were present and vise versa for sequences where only two or three out of four transitions were present our algorithm encountered difficulties in correctly detecting the time moments of those transitions of a single motion corrected cell_nucleus going from the g phase through the early s middle s late s to the g phase indicated by bars in different shades of gray below the images as automatically recognized by our system based on characteristic foci patterns for each of these phases the example also illustrates the observation that it is easier also visually to distinguish the g phases from the s phases than to distinguish between the different s phases the four plots correspond to the four possible phase_transitions a g to early s cases b early s to middle s cases c middle s to late s cases and d late s to g cases in each case the difference in detection times between the automated method and each of the two observers is plotted a missing point on one of the curves in c means that the corresponding phase_transition was not detected by the corresponding observer
