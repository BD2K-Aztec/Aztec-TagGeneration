genetics_and mcheza a workbench to detect selection using dominant markers motivation dominant markers darts and aflps are commonly used for genetic_analysis in the fields of evolutionary_genetics ecology and conservation of genetic_resources the recent prominence of these markers has coincided with renewed interest in detecting the effects of local selection and adaptation at the level of the genome results we present mcheza an application for detecting loci under selection based on a well evaluated f st outlier method the application allows robust estimates to be made of model_parameters e g genome_wide average neutral f st provides data import and export functions iterative contour smoothing and generation of graphics in an easy to use graphical_user with a computation engine that supports multicore processors for enhanced_performance mcheza also provides functionality to mitigate common analytical errors when scanning for loci under selection availability mcheza is freely_available under gpl version fromnon specific amplification methods such as diversity arrays technology dart markers and amplified_fragment aflp are commonly used for analysis of withinspecies variation because they allow the rapid acquisition of substantial genetic_information at relatively low_cost although other alternative sequencing_techniques have since been developed darts and aflps are still widely used in the fields of evolutionary_genetics ecology and conservation one of the most important_applications of these dominant markers is in detecting the effects of selection and local adaptation at the level of the genome in areas ranging from parasitology to conservation genetics there are two current approaches to detect selection classical f st outlier approaches reviewed in based on the distribution of summary_statistics and those based on likelihood such as the original f st outlier methods do not account for dominant markers such darts or aflps these markers have two phenotypes detectable at each locus one allele the plus allele is amplifiable a fundamental consideration in the design of mcheza is supporting the user by correctly computing important non trivial parameters that are needed to properly calculate candidate loci for selection erroneous usage of population_genetics applications can easily produce results that seem correct but are in effect wrong while mcheza tries to minimize usage errors the user should be aware of potential limits of the underlying method potential users are advised to read wherein several scenarios where dfdist is less applicable are clearly explained in particular the bayesian_method of foll and implemented in the program bayescan is an important alternative with which results should be compared by improving the estimation of the neutral mean f st when the number of demes is low mcheza addresses situations where dfdist is known to perform less well in summary mcheza tries to provide an intuitive_interface which includes intelligent suggestions to the user with regards to correct usage of software while enforcing model constraints and providing necessary corrections e g fdr support it is hoped that this approach will lower barriers to its use allowing researchers to concentrate more on the biological_problems including the theoretical assumptions and limitations of underlying models and less on unnecessary software complexity
