sequence_analysis interactive software_tool to comprehend the calculation of optimal sequence_alignments with dynamic_programming dynamic_programming dp is a general optimization strategy that is successfully used across various disciplines of science in bioinformatics it is widely_applied in calculating the optimal alignment between pairs of protein or dna_sequences these alignments form the basis of new verifiable biological hypothesis despite its importance there are no interactive tools available for training and education on understanding the dp algorithm here we introduce an interactive computer application with a graphical_interface for the purpose of educating students about dp the program displays the dp scoring_matrix and the resulting optimal alignment s while allowing the user to modify key_parameters such as the values in the similarity matrix the sequence_alignment algorithm version and the gap opening extension penalties we hope that this software will be useful to teachers and students of bioinformatics courses as well as researchers who implement the dp algorithm for diverse applications availability_and the software is freely_available at http melolab org sat the software is written in the java computer language thus it runs on all major platforms and operating_systems including windows mac os x and linux contact all inquiries or comments about this software should be directed to francisco melo at fmelo bio puc cldynamic programming dp algorithm was first formalized by the mathematician richard bellman in the early s since then dp has been adapted to solve many optimization_problems in different areas of science dp in various forms constitutes the core of bioinformatics it is central to several software applications such as those comparing sequences and structures of proteins rna and dna the pivotal_role of dp algorithm in bioinformatics has led it to be considered as an essential topic of any undergraduate and graduate course in bioinformatics despite the simplicity of its formulation dp algorithm is a subject that is not easy for the students to learn extensive practice is essential for students to fully appreciate it workings given its importance and its mandatory presence in bioinformatics courses there are not interactive computer to whom correspondence should be addressed tools designed to help students to understand the specific details of the dp algorithm we have addressed this need by developing sequence_alignment teacher sat a simple software application which interactively calculates the dp matrix in real_time sat also visually illustrates the consequences of tweaking the various parameters of the algorithm we hope this simple software_tool will not only be useful for teachers and students of bioinformatics courses but also to future bioinformatics developers as an error check tool when they start implementing this algorithm for the first time
