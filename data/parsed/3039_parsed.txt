modeling associations between genetic_markers using bayesian_networks motivation understanding the patterns of association between polymorphisms at different loci in a population linkage_disequilibrium ld is of fundamental_importance in various genetic_studies many coefficients were proposed for measuring the degree of ld but they provide only a static view of the current ld_structure generative_models gms were proposed to go beyond these measures giving not only a description of the actual ld_structure but also a tool to help understanding the process that generated such structure gms based in coalescent_theory have been the most appealing because they link ld to evolutionary factors nevertheless the inference and parameter_estimation of such models is still computationally_challenging results we present a more practical method to build gm that describe ld the method is based on learning weighted bayesian network_structures from haplotype_data extracting equivalence structure classes and using them to model ld the results obtained in public data from the hapmap database showed that the method is a promising tool for modeling ld the associations represented by the learned models are correlated with the traditional measure of ld d the method was able to represent ld blocks found by standard_tools the granularity of the association blocks and the readability of the models can be controlled in the method the results suggest that the causality information gained by our method can be useful to tell about the conservability of the genetic_markers and to guide the selection of subset of representative markers availability the implementation of the method is available upon request by email contact maciel sc usp brthe detection of linkage_disequilibrium ld the non random association of alleles at different loci in a population and the assessing of its intensity extent and distribution is a fundamental step in many genetic_studies in association studies for example the search for the locus or loci responsible of a particular trait or disease is narrowed to regions of high_ld ld blocks where genotyped genetic_markers were observed to be associated with the studied phenotype in population_genetic ld patterns has been widely used to study the evolutionary and demographic_processes in a variety of animal and plant_populations such as admixtures migration and natural_selection ld_information was also useful to learn more about the architecture of the human_genome and its biology of recombination to whom correspondence should be addressed a variety of coefficients have been proposed to quantify the intensity of ld see mueller for a review pairwise ld measures were the first ones reported for this purpose which measure the overall allele association between two loci popular examples of such measures are d and r subsequently multi_locus ld coefficients were proposed to measure simultaneous allele associations among multiple_loci classical examples are the i a index and the coefficient h recently information_theory was used to develop new ld coefficients some examples are the coefficent based in entropy the normalized_mutual mir coefficient and the normalized relative entropy er coefficient this active search of ld coefficients has been accompanied with the development of various tools that display ld measures in a comprehensive way examples of those tools are goldsurfer haploview and ldcompare this remarkable interest in developing new measures and tools for studying ld can be explained by the dramatic_increase of public genotype data from the hapmap project for example which at the same time enabled association studies in a whole genome_scale that presented new statistical and computational challenges due to the vast quantity of data collected although some of the aforementioned ld measures and tools were useful in characterizing ld at various genomic_regions of several populations they are limited to provide a static view of the ld_structure in the studied region in an attempt to go beyond these measures some generative_models gms were proposed gms are useful because they model the process that generate the observed data providing the machinery to do inferences and simulations of yet unobserved situations or to help understanding the underlying generative process models based in coalescent_theory have been the most appealing gms because they relate ld to evolutionary factors such as recombination_rate migration and mutation however the parameter_estimation and inference in such models is still computationally_challenging and only applicable to short regions a more practical alternative to model ld is to learn probabilistic_graphical pgms directly from the observed genotype or haplotype_data as proposed by thomas and camp pgm are a type of gms that have proven to be useful in modeling a variety of complex real_world problems mainly due to the following reasons intuitive interpretability of the models their ability to encode the joint probability_distribution with a reduced number of parameters and the existence of efficient methods to learn pgm from data and to make inferences because the learningpage i i i the described method was implemented in the c programming_language and tested in a bit core ghz computer with gb of ram running a linux operating system the graph drawing was performed using the graph visualization software www graphviz org to test the ability of the proposed approach in characterizing ld we used public data registered in the hapmap database we chose three genomic segment located in encode regions of different chromosomes and different populations as shown in encode regions were chosen due to their high_density of genotyped snps markers and to the availability of existing_studies in such regions the segments were selected increasing their size and complexity of the ld patterns figs and aiming to test the method in different situations the datasets were obtained from the hapmap repository version iii release via the genome_browser web_application http hapmap ncbi nlm nih gov using the option download phased haplotype_data the snp markers with minor_allele maf were discarded since they have little polymorphism the following set of parameters were introduced to the learning method in all tests population_size couples in the mating pool crossover rate mutation_rate number of replacement individuals in each generation number of generations maximum number of parents a node may have u snps for clarity and space we first detail the results for the enm chb jpt dataset and then present summarized results for the other datasets shows the evolution of the best fitness and average fitness of the bn structures learned from the enm chb jptthese datasets were obtained from the hapmap repository version iii release using the genome_browser web_application http hapmap ncbi nlm nih gov only snps with maf were considered dataset only the first generations are shown since the curves remain_unchanged in subsequent generations as can be observed the first optimal bn structure is found at the fifth generation six generations later the entire population converged to only optimal bn structures the average fitness stabilizes at its maximum value this can be considered a fast convergence since it is reached in approximately the first of the total number of generations we use a predefined high number of generations as a stopping criterion because we were interested in exploring the topological diversity of optimal bn structures to get equivalence_classes pdags all the optimal learned dags a total of dags from generations to were analyzed twelve different dags were identified in that set which were grouped into four different pdags each having edges one of these pdags is shown in the other pdags are similar to this figure differing only in the location of three edges for each of these pdags was determined the set of pairwise marker associations no difference was found between these four sets of pairwise associations as can be observed two association blocks were identified in the pdag which are consistent with the two ld blocks block and block found in the triangular ld plot by the haploview tool using the strong ld spine block definition with the aim to knowing how the associations and association blocks are affected with the elimination of weak edges we perform two experiments in the pdag of in the first experiment the edges with strengths lower than the first quartile the lower_quartile were eliminated the resulting pdag is shown inwith edges there was no alteration either in the set of pairwise associations or in the association blocks these blocks are also indicated with line segments at the top of the ld plot of the segmeted lines all q and q at the top represent the association blocks found in the original pdag the pdag with the first quartile of edges removed and the pdag with the second quartile of edges removed respectively in the second experiment the edges with strengths lower than the second quartile the worst half of edges were eliminated the resulting pdag is shown in in this case the number of pairwise associations fell from to but the association blocks remained_unchanged this preservation of the association blocks with the removal of significant number of edges can be due to the high compaction of the ld blocks a summary of results of executing the method in all datasets can be found in it can be observed that the convergence generation increases with the number of markers as well as the processing time this is an expected result since the search_space is bigger and more complex like the results in the enm chb jpt dataset the four pdags obtained from the enr ceu dataset and the three pdags obtained from the enr yri dataset represent the same set of pairwise associations and the same association blocks these blocks are illustrated as segmented lines with the name all at the top ofand respectively as can be noticed the association blocks represented in the pdags considering all edges tend to be generous grouping large quantity of nodes into few blocks including in such blocks markers with moderate to low d values when the lower_quartile of edges is removed the association blocks are splitted into more compact blocks line segments q when the second lower_quartile of edges is removed the association blocks line segments q tend to be more segmented and similar to that found by the strong ld spine block definition it is interesting to know the relationship between the learned associations represented by the pdags and the classical measure of ld d for this end figures a b and c shows the distributionsof the associations with respect to equally_spaced intervals of d for the three datasets respectively it is possible to observe a clear trend in the three datasets to represent associations with high d values in the interval when edges are pruned at first quartile the distributions of the represented associations are almost unchanged when the second quartile of edges are removed the association distributions are moderately altered predominantly in the lower intervals of d this means that weak edges are important components of weak d associations and vice_versa the learned pdags showed another interesting information the markers most central in the blocks tend to have more outgoing edges e g markers and in all pdags of and the markers on the block boundaries tend to have predominantly incoming edges markers and in all pdags of an explanation for this behavior is that genetic_markers near the center of the blocks are highly_conserved in the population had minimal recombination which is reflected in the learned models by their tendency to be more causative than dependent nodes this suggests that the causal information gained by bn models can be useful to tell about the conservability of the genetic_markers in the analyzed population the learned causal information can also be useful to guide the selection of an informative subset of tags markers since nodes that have predominantly outgoing edges can explain the allele status of their dependent markers being good candidates as tag markers i page i i i
