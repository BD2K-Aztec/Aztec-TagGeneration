network based pathway_enrichment with incomplete network information motivation pathway_enrichment has become a key tool for biomedical_researchers to gain insight into the underlying biology of differentially_expressed proteins and metabolites it reduces complexity and provides a system level view of changes in cellular activity in response to treatments and or in disease_states methods that use existing pathway network information have been shown to outperform simpler methods that only take into account pathway membership however despite significant progress in understanding the association amongst members of biological_pathways and expansion of data bases containing information about interactions of bio molecules the existing network information may be incomplete or inaccurate and is not cell_type or disease condition specific results we propose a constrained network estimation framework that combines network estimation based on cell and condition specific high_dimensional omics_data with interaction information from existing data bases the resulting pathway topology_information is subsequently used to provide a framework for simultaneous testing of differences in expression levels of pathway members as well as their interactions we study the asymptotic properties of the proposed network esti mator and the test for pathway enrichment and investigate its small sample performance in simulated_and settings availability_and the proposed method has been implemented in the r package netgsa available on cran recent_advances in high_throughput have transformed biomedical_research by enabling comprehensive monitoring of complex_biological by profiling the activity of different molecular compartments genomic proteomic metabolomic one can delineate complex mechanisms that play_key biological_processes or the development of distinct phenotypes these technological_advances have thus motivated new methodological_developments most notably the adaptation of systems perspectives to analyze biological_systems pathway analysis represents a key_component in the analysis process and has been used successfully in generating new biological_hypotheses as well as in determining whether specific pathways are associated with particular phenotypes examples_include analysis of pathways involved in initiation and progression of cancer and other complex_diseases discovering novel transcriptional effects and co regulated_genes and understanding the basic biological_processes in model_organisms seefor additional examples of applications pathway analysis methods have evolved since the seminal work by as pointed_out in the review article by earlier techniques such as over representation analysis and gene_set gsa treat each pathway as a set of biomolecules these methods assess whether members of a given pathway have higher than expected levels of activity either by counting the number of differentially active members or by also accounting for the relative rankings of pathway members and or the magnitude of their associations with the phenotype on the other hand more recent and statistically powerful_methods also account for interactions between biomolecules these interactions are increasingly available from carefully curated biological_databases such as kyoto_encyclopedia kegg reactome regulondb and biocarta a network_topology based method that exhibits superior statistical_power in identifying differential activity of pathways was proposed in the network based gene_set netgsa method also allows testing for potential changes in the network_structure under different experimental or disease conditions however it requires a priori_knowledge of interactions among pathway members which despite rapid progress remains highly incomplete and occasionally unreliable see e g and references therein moreover existing network information often determine molecular_interactions in the normal state of the cell and do not provide any insight into condition disease specific alterations in interactions amongst components of biological_systems the increased availability of large sets of high_dimensional omics_data e g from the cancer_genome tcga http can cergenome nih gov coupled with the development of network estimation_techniques based on graphical_models offers the possibility to validate and complement existing network information and to obtain condition specific estimates of molecular_interactions such an approach for leveraging existing knowledge to enhance the analysis of low signal to noise biological_datasets was advocated in the first contribution of this article is the development of a method for constrained network estimation from high_dimensional together with establishing the consistency of the resulting estimate estimation of high_dimensional networks subject to hard or soft constraints on conditional dependence relationships amongst random_variables represents a canonical problem in the context of graphical_models and the proposed method for addressing this problem is of independent interest by incorporating the conditionspecific network estimates from the proposed method into the netgsa framework we also provide a rigorous statistical_framework for assessing alterations in biological_pathways referred to as differential network biology the proposed_framework accounts for two sources of uncertainty the first concerns the reliability of the external_information used for constructing the network estimate from data the second is the variability of the network estimate which can impact the pathway enrichment testing procedure we establish that under certain regularity conditions consistent estimates of the network can be obtained leading in turn to an asymptotically most power unbiased test for pathway_enrichment our theoretical_analysis also sheds light into the potential_improvements in accuracy and power by directly accounting for the amount of reliable external network information a second objective of this study is to scale up the netgsa estimation algorithm to very large size networks the main bottleneck in applying the netgsa methodology arises from the estimation of mixed effects linear parametersspecifically the variance componentsfor thousands of variables we develop efficient and stable computational_methods for estimation of these parameters based on a profile likelihood approach in particular we employ a cholesky factorization of the covariance_matrices to speed up matrix inversions and use it to develop a stable algorithm based on newtons method with backtracking line search for step size_selection to supply reliable starting points for this algorithm we further develop an approximate method ofmoment type estimator the proposed methods are illustrated on both metabolomics and gene_expression data for mass_spectrometry metabolomics profiling one can obtain good quality measurements for a few hundred metabolites that do not provide complete coverage of the underlying biochemical_pathways the small number of metabolites in each pathway and the incomplete coverage of the metabolites particularly hinder the application of over representation and gsa methods in this setting in our experience only topology based pathway_enrichment methods such as netgsa are capable of reliably delineating pathway activity as illustrated in section further our investigation of previously analyzed gene_expression data_set on lung and breast_cancer provides new useful insights the remainder of the article is organized as follows section presents the new method for network estimation under external_information constraints and establishes its consistency section outlines the new computational algorithm for scaling up netgsa as well as the inference procedure for both pathway enrichment and differential_network the performance of the developed methodology is evaluated in section and is examined on real_data in section this article introduces a constrained partial_correlation network estimation method that seamlessly incorporates externally available interaction information for genes and other biomolecules the end_product is a reliable condition specific estimate of the underlying networks the resulting estimated network_structures are then used for network based pathway_enrichment for the purpose of constrained network estimation one might also try the one step constrained maximum_likelihood a functionality offered in the r package glasso to recover the underlying partial_correlation network however this one step approach_requires sophisticated specification of the tuning parameters at positions for which structural_information is available and can be challenging to implement in practice two sources of uncertainty can be identified in the proposed_framework one from the reliability of the external database information in the network estimation procedure and the other from the uncertainty regarding the estimated network itself as well as how it propagates into the netgsa testing procedure as discussed in remark the proposed method can conveniently accommodate the first source of uncertainty by incorporating a non zero penalty on parameters that are uncertain further as shown in theorem the proposed test via the extended netgsa framework is asymptotically unbiased and most powerful given the consistency of the estimated network and hence accounts for the second source of uncertainty nevertheless in finite samples as the numerical work in the supplementary_materials section c illustrates type i errors may be slightly off in the presence of numerous errors in the estimated network either due to misspecification of the external_information or lack of samples for accurate estimation the topic of dealing with network estimation errors and possible ways to address it is discussed in narayan and allen finally the current framework of netgsa uses the cholesky decomposition of the covariance_matrix of the underlying_network it is natural to ask whether the order of the variables affects the result of enrichment_analysis in simulations and the real_data we find that the estimated powers p values from netgsa are comparable after permutation of the variables
