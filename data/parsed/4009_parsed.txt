ridgerace ridge_regression for continuous ancestral character estimation on phylogenetic_trees motivation ancestral character state reconstruction describes a set of techniques for estimating phenotypic or genetic_features of species or related individuals that are the predecessors of those present today such reconstructions can reach into the distant past and can provide insights into the history of a population or a set of species when fossil data are not available or they can be used to test evolutionary hypotheses e g on the co evolution of traits typical methods for ancestral character state reconstruction of continuous characters consider the phylogeny of the underlying data and estimate the ancestral process along the branches of the tree they usually assume a brownian_motion model of character evolution or extensions thereof requiring specific assumptions on the rate of phenotypic evolution results we suggest using ridge_regression to infer rates for each branch of the tree and the ancestral values at each inner node we performed extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of this method and have shown that the accuracy of its reconstructed ancestral values is competitive to reconstructions using other state of the art software using a hierarchical_clustering of gene_mutation profiles from an ovarian_cancer dataset we demonstrate the use of the method as a feature_selection tool availability_and the algorithm described here is implemented in c as a stand alone program and the source_code is freely_available atmany biological studies investigate the ancestral states of one or several discrete and continuous characters on a phylogenetic_tree comparative_methods correlate the evolution of alleles at different loci with each other or with a trait and thus often require the reconstruction of ancestral values typical examples for discrete characters are the reconstruction of the absence presence or state of genes or traits for the internal nodes of the tree i e for the ancestral organisms while typical examples for continuous characters are environmental preferences of different species measures of morphology or physiology or behavioral or metabolic properties such reconstructions are also of interest when fossil records cannot be retrieved when the phenotype of interest cannot be determined from the fossil tissue or when studying the evolution of a gene_family across different environmental_conditions statistical_approaches such as regression or correlation can fail to estimate correlations between traits correctly when they assume that closely_related are statistically independent comparative_methods account for such dependencies by including estimates of the phylogeny underlying the data into their predictions in the case of continuous characters most of these techniques are based on a simple model assuming neutral evolution of the respective character the brownian_motion bm model assumes that the trait of a leaf node in a phylogeny develops as a random_walk starting from the ancestral root the duration of that walkand therefore the change and variance in the traitis assumed to be proportional to the change in branch length covered between those two nodes at each inner node the random_walk bifurcates creating two dependent_processes and thus defining a stochastic distribution for all leaves several methods that apply the bm model are available to reconstruct continuous ancestral characters and implemented in widely used software_packages such as ape geiger phytools mesquite bayestrait continuous paup and contml one of the simplest ways to reconstruct a continuous ancestral character state was established with felsensteins algorithm for phylogenetic independent contrasts in the phylogenetic independent contrasts algorithm ancestral values are computed recursively as the weighted_average of their child values with the weights set according to the distance i e the branch length of these children in addition branch_lengths leading to reconstructed internal nodes are rescaled to account for the uncertainty of the reconstruction this leads to a maximum_likelihood of the ancestral value for the root node alone other algorithms estimate the values for the whole tree by re rooting or by a squared change maximum_parsimony approach linear_regression allows another framework to formulate the reconstruction of ancestral character states and generalized least_squares has been suggested as a technique to reconstruct ancestral values as a weighted_average of the values of all extant_species while taking the correlation_structure described by the phylogenetic_tree into account this approach is particularly flexible as it allows detailed assumptions of the evolutionary_process by inclusion of an appropriate covariance_matrix several possible extensions and modifications of the bm process have been suggested and can be considered for ancestral character state reconstruction for example the ornsteinuhlenbeck ou process models adaptation explicitly by defining a single global optimum or several local_optima of to whom correspondence should be addressed

provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com directional_selection a major restriction of the bm and the ou models noted in for example is the assumption of a constant_rate of trait variation throughout the underlying phylogeny the early burst model offers an alternative that decreases the rate of evolution exponentially through time and describes a process of adaptive radiationprovide a detailed comparison the acdc model describes a process of accelerating versus decelerating rates of character evolution toward an optimum i e a combination of ou and early burst several methods allow us to estimate bm rates to test for variations in that rate or use different rates in different parts of the tree or to suggest global branch length transformations in the phylogeny to account for variable rates however most of the phylogenetic_methods aforementioned do not explicitly aim to reconstruct ancestral character states they are originally concerned with correlations between two or more traits phylogenetic regression grafen or with tests for deviation from the assumption of a globally constant_rate and they do not suggest how to infer ancestral character states for more complex scenarios in addition critical studies note that deciding on the correct model might be difficult and warn of over interpreting the phylogenetic patterns we here describe a new method for the inference of ancestral character states for continuous characters by performing a ridge_regression between the total branch length reaching from theridgerace ridge_regression for ancestral character estimation root to a leaf node and the phenotypic value of that leaf the inference is made by minimizing the prediction_error at extant nodes as well as an additional l norm regularization factor the regularization forces the phenotypic rate to be distributed more equally across the whole tree and to branches shared by several nodes circumventing the trivial case that explains the phenotype by a gain at the terminal branches owing to the overparameterization our evaluation showed that ridgerace achieved a good congruence between inferred and simulated ancestral character states and that it performed_similarly to or better than two other state of the art methods in terms of the mean squared error ridgerace does not assume any underlying model of evolution and thus the method allows large flexibility when no definite assumptions can be made about the type of evolutionary_process the formulation of the optimization_problem allows the straightforward inclusion of measurements at ancestral nodes e g from fossil records in a similar fashion multiple measurements at a node can be easily included to lend further support to the inference such measurements might originate from multiple observations of the same trait for the same species or they might represent several traits fitted together finally visualization of the inferred branch weights along the tree allows a detailed interpretation of the specific phenotypic rates and can indicate short periods of strong directional_selection or of increasingly branches are colored according to the phenotypic rate parameter the thickness of branches is proportional to the number of nodes below them branches leading directly to leaf nodes were colored gray for improved
