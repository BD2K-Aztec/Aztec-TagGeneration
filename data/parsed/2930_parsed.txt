methods for time series analysis of rna_seq with application to human th cell_differentiation motivation gene_expression using rna_seq is a powerful technique for screening rna species landscapes and their dynamics in an unbiased way while several advanced methods exist for differential_expression of rna_seq proper tools to anal yze rna_seq time course have not been proposed results in this study we use rna_seq to measure gene_expression during the early human t_helper th cell_differentiation and t cell activation th to quantify th specific gene_expression dynamics we present a novel statistical methodology dynb for analyzing time course rna_seq we use non parametric gaussian processes to model temporal_correlation in gene_expression and combine that with negative_binomial likelihood for the count_data to account for experiment specific_biases in gene_expression dynamics such as differences in cell_differentiation efficiencies we propose a method to rescale the dynamics between replicated measurements we develop an mcmc sampling method to make inference of differential_expression dynamics between conditions dynb identifies several known and novel genes involved in th differentiation analysis of differentiation efficiencies revealed consistent_patterns in gene_expression dynamics between different cultures we use qrt_pcr to validate differential_expression and differentiation efficiencies for selected genes comparison of the results with those obtained via traditional timepoint wise analysis shows that time course analysis together with time rescaling between cultures identifies differentially_expressed which would not otherwise be detected availability an implementation of the proposed computational_methods will be available ata rna_seq experiment provides a snapshot of rna content within a cell_population the observed data is in a form of millions of short nucleotide_sequences which can be used to construct a de_novo transcriptome or aligned against known reference_genome and transcriptome to quantify expressions of known genes a common approach is to count the reads which are aligned to different genes the discrete nature of count_data led researchers to model the sequencing_data using poisson_distribution see e g recently it has been shown that the poisson_distribution is insufficient for modeling sequencing_data because it tends to underestimate the variance for highly_expressed an extension of the poisson_distribution the negative_binomial has gained popularity in modeling gene_expression data from rna_seq or other sequencing based count_data because it can account for this over dispersion two commonly used approaches which use the negative_binomial to detect differential_expression are deseq and edger another method called bayseq uses an empirical bayesian_method to estimate the posterior_probabilities that a gene is or is not differentially_expressed profiling gene_expression over time provides information about the dynamical_behavior of the genes presented a method that can analyze time series microarray_data in order to assess the differential_expression from whole time series as opposed to the traditional_methods which analyze timepoints independently more recently presented a methodology that uses gaussian processes gps to model gene_expression over time and to identify the time intervals when each gene is differentially_expressed we have further extended the gp approach to quantify condition specific differential_expression among multiple time course experiments aij o these methodologies are not optimal for analyzing count_data due to the different statistical characteristics and to our knowledge next masigpro is the only methodology capable of taking_into the temporal dimension of rna_seq time series in addition by taking_into temporal_correlation makes it possible to carry out more detailed analysis of the observed dynamics e g to quantify similarities and differences between the observed kinetics to that end gps have been used for modeling temporally or spatially_varying likelihood parameters in other fields e g to model the rate parameter of the poisson_distribution temporally and the stochastic_process that is produced is called as the gaussian cox process similar approaches have also been popular in geostatistics since the discovery of an interleukin producing t cell subset this t_helper th cell_lineage has been a focus of great research interest th cells have been shown to play_an in autoimmune_diseases and inflammation recent_studies have identified transcription_factor genes rorc and stat as the key_regulators of the early th differentiation in murine see a review in na ve human t cells are activated through the t cell receptor

cells by exposing the cells to tgf il and il the goal of gene_expression in the early_phase of th differentiation is to gain insight into the process of differentiation by unraveling dependencies between key_factors and to understand how the differentiation signal propagates through various pathways and gene_regulatory this knowledge could potentially prove useful in identifying biomarkers for immune related_diseases and in design of therapeutic_interventions we present a methodology dynb that is built on the negative_binomial likelihood and gps non parametric gp regression is used to model gene_expression over time and the model inference is carried using the bayesian reasoning we demonstrate the applicability of dynb by analyzing rna_seq time series datasets we also show how dynb can be used to study relative differentiation efficiencies between biological_samples the differentially_expressed detected by dynb as well as estimated differences in differentiation efficiencies for selected genes are validated using qrt_pcr
