aliview a fast and lightweight alignment viewer and editor for large_datasets aliview is an alignment viewer and editor designed to meet the requirements of next_generation era phylogenetic datasets aliview handles alignments of unlimited size in the formats most commonly used i e fasta phylip nexus clustal and msf the intuitive graphical_interface makes it easy to inspect sort delete merge and realign sequences as part of the manual filtering process of large_datasets aliview also works as an easy to use alignment editor for small as well as large_datasets availability_and aliview is released as open_source under the gnu_general version gplv and is available at github www github com aliview the program is cross_platform and extensively tested on linux mac os x and windows systems downloads and help are available atas dna and protein datasets are getting larger the demand for a refined and fast alignment editor increases the need for an improved alignment editor and viewer therefore emerged in the plants project kp www onekp com while designing degenerate_primers for a diverse set of ferns from transcriptome_data what was lacking in the previous available programs was the combination of abilities to i get an overview of large nucleotide alignments ii visually highlight various conserved_regions iii have a simple and intuitive way to align rearrange delete and merge sequences and iv find degenerate_primers in selected semiconserved regions although some of these features are individually present in current alignment editors the combination is not in addition to the core functionality meeting these specific needs aliview is designed with a complete set of intuitive general functions meeting the most common demands for preparing a multiple_sequence here aliview is introduced as an alignment viewer and editor with a unique combination of features that allows the user to work with large_datasets the intuitive_user provides easy visual overview and navigation and works with unlimited size alignments
