gene network_inference by probabilistic scoring of relationships from a factorized model of interactions motivation epistasis_analysis is an essential tool of classical genetics for inferring the order of function of genes in a common pathway typically it considers single and double_mutant phenotypes and for a pair of genes observes whether a change in the first gene masks the effects of the mutation in the second gene despite the recent_emergence of biotechnology techniques that can provide gene interaction data on a large possibly genomic_scale few methods are available for quantitative epistasis_analysis and epistasis based network_reconstruction results we here propose a conceptually new probabilistic_approach to gene network_inference from quantitative interaction data the approach is founded on epistasis_analysis its features are joint treatment of the mutant phenotype data with a factorized model and probabil istic scoring of pairwise gene relationships that are inferred from the latent gene representation the resulting gene network is assembled from scored pairwise relationships in an experimental study we show that the proposed approach can accurately_reconstruct several known pathways and that it surpasses the accuracy of current approaches availability_and source_code is available at http epistasis_analysis is a tool of classical genetics for inferring the order of genes in pathways from mutant based phenotypes epistasis asserts that two genes interact if the mutation in one gene masks the effects of perturbations in the other gene then assuming a common pathway the first masking gene would be downstream and the products of the second gene would regulate the expression of the first one epistasis_analysis uncovers the relationship between a pair of genes its logic can be further extended to uncover parallelism where both genes have an effect on the phenotype but where there is no epistasis uncovered pairwise relationships in a group of genes can give rise to a reconstruction of more complex multi gene_networks an enlightening demonstration of the power of epistasis for assembly of gene_networks is for instance a reconstruction of a four gene cell_death in caenorhabditis_elegans emergent technologies from molecular_biology that record phenotypes of single and double_mutants at a large possibly genomic_scale prompt for the development of systematic approaches for epistasis_analysis and pose the need to devise computational_tools that support gene network_inference approaches of mutagenesis by homologous_recombination or rna_interference can yield phenotype observations for thousands or even millions of mutants several past_studies considered mutant assays with qualitative phenotypes zupan to whom correspondence should be addressed hypothetical example of epistasis_analysis with three genes u v and w nodes in the central graph represent mutant phenotypes the phenotypic difference between a double_knockout e g ruv and a single knockout mutant e g is represented with the length of the corresponding dotted edge expected double_mutant phenotypes which assume no interaction between genes see also section are denoted with e e g a double_mutant uv a has a phenotype similar to that of a single mutant v which indicates that v is epistatic to u from the activity of genes v and w b we conjecture that gene v partially depends on gene w i e v also acts through a separate pathway because their double_mutant vw has a phenotype that is equally similar to the single knockout rw and the expected phenotype evw the phenotype of double_knockout uw c is close to the expected phenotype of uw euw which may be explained by u and w acting independently in parallel_pathways gene ordering from these three relations is preserved in the joint network d which is a candidate pathway of genes u v and w the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons http

quantitative fitness scores or even whole_genome transcriptional_profiles majority of these studies present gene_networks as collections of directly observed pairwise interactions e g and do not propose a generally_applicable formalism to model the data only few general_purpose algorithms for inference of epistatic networks have been proposed introduced formal rules and inference algorithm to infer different types of relationships between genes but could treat only qualitative phenotypes and could not handle noise these limitations were elegantly bypassed by a bayesian_approach of battle et_al that can handle larger data_sets with few hundred genes this algorithm is to our knowledge also the only modern approach to inference of epistasis networks gene epistasis_analysis infers interactions that stem directly from mutant phenotypes its causative reasoning is different from other network_reconstruction tools that observe correlations between gene profiles e g and infer relationships that are circumstantial despite the growing body of quantitative genetic_interaction data and our ability to collect such data computational_approaches and tools to support epistasis are at best scarce devising methods for inference of gene pathways from mutant based phenotypes and developing related software_tools remains_a of computational_systems we here present a new epistasis_analysis inspired computational_approach to infer gene_networks from a collection of quantitative mutant phenotypes we refer to our method as r ed pronounced as r ed meaning order in slovene our work was motivated by the bayesian learning method of henceforth denoted by activity pathway network apn that starts from a random_network and then iteratively refines it to best match data inferred relationships the model refinement in apn is carried_out through a succession of local structural changes of the evolving network this procedure may substantially depend on arbitrary initialization of network_structure and hence requires ensembling across many runs of the algorithm to raise accuracy of the final network our approach is conceptually different from apn we first simultaneously infer a probabilistic_model for the entire set of pairwise relationships relationship probabilities serve as preferences for different types of pairwise relationships e g epistasis parallelism and partial interdependence used in a single step construction of a gene network in contrast to apns local network changes r ed applies a global procedure to infer the relationships between genes and does not require ensembling the probabilistic_model of r ed uses matrix completion derived latent data representation to account for noise and sparsity inference of factorized model also includes construction of a gene specific data transformation to account for the differences in single mutant backgrounds which may affect the phenotype of double_mutants in an experimental study we show that both components are necessary for inferring gene_networks of high_accuracy r ed is a conceptually new approach for inference of gene_networks from quantitative genetic_interaction data it implements a probabilistic epistasis_analysis and assembles pairwise relationships into gene_networks in our experiments r ed was able to reconstruct several known and partially known pathways with accuracy above that of the state of the art approaches r ed outperforms apn the state of the art method by both in accuracy and speed with cpu runtime of only a few minutes compared with apns min for an inference of a single full network in an ensemble of networks we also show that r eds power of generalization comes from its two key components a factorized model with latent representation of gene interactions and a gene dependent logistic map of interaction scores our evaluation in this article was computational and thus limited to datasets for which several gene pathways or at least partial gene orderings were available r ed can efficiently handle similar datasets as well as much larger ones such as that from the recent yeast experiments by these are also the datasets for which we foresee future applications of r ed and which will require subsequent verification of inferred networks in the wet_lab
