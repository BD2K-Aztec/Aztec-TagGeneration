bioinformatics btq tex sequence_analysis assigning roles to dna regulatory_motifs using comparative_genomics motivation transcription_factors tfs are crucial during the lifetime of the cell their functional_roles are defined by the genes they regulate uncovering these roles not only sheds light on the tf at hand but puts it into the context of the complete regulatory_network results here we present an alignment and threshold free comparative_genomics approach for assigning functional_roles to dna regulatory_motifs we incorporate our approach into the gomo algorithm a computational_tool for detecting associations between a user specified dna regulatory motif expressed as a position_weight pwm and gene_ontology go terms incorporating multiple species into the analysis significantly_improves gomos ability to identify go terms associated with the regulatory_targets of tfs including three comparative species in the process of predicting tf roles in saccharomyces_cerevisiae and homo_sapiens increases the number of significant predictions by and respectively the predicted go terms are also more specific yielding deeper biological_insight into the role of the tf adjusting motif binding_affinity scores for individual sequence_composition proves to be essential for avoiding false_positive associations we describe a novel dna_sequence scoring algorithm that compensates a thermodynamic measure of dna binding_affinity for individual sequence base_composition gomos prediction_accuracy proves to be relatively insensitive to how promoters are defined because gomo uses a threshold free form of gene_set there are no free_parameters to tune biologists can investigate the potential_roles of dna regulatory_motifs of interest using gomo via the webthe regulation of gene_expression is crucial in the development and functioning of cells dna_binding called transcription_factors tfs are one cog in the regulatory machinery shared by all cellular and multi_cellular organisms the human_genome for instance is estimated to contain up to such tfs of which only about are annotated as such and only have experimentally to whom correspondence should be addressed verified in vivo dna_binding and regulatory activity for the vast_majority of tfs in higher organisms the set of genes they regulate as well as the biological_functions they are involved in is largely_unknown however for a growing number of tfs models of their dna_binding propensities are known the advent of protein binding microarrays pbms in particular is rapidly making dna binding_affinity data available for large_numbers of tfs in many species another source of dna binding_affinity data for tfs is chromatin_immunoprecipitation followed by deep_sequencing chip_seq both of these types of data can be used to construct a position_weight pwm model of the dna binding_affinity of a given tf such models are herein referred to as motifs and can also model the dna binding_affinity of other molecules including micrornas gene_expression data can also be used to discover dna_binding utilizing ab_initio motif_discovery from the promoters of sets of co expressed genes in contrast to the pbm and chip_seq approaches motif_discovery in sets of co expressed genes usually results in dna_binding for which the binding molecule e g tf or microrna is unknown one application of dna_binding is the in silico prediction of the regulatory_targets of the tfs to predict the targets of a tf its binding_motif is used to score promoter_regions of genes for their potential to bind the tf protein it is well known that such predictions are not very specific and many false_positives must be tolerated if all regulatory_targets of a tf are to be detected however as we have previously shown even such noisy tf target predictions contain sufficient information to allow us to make useful predictions of the biological_roles of the tf the focus of the current work is to improve the sensitivity of computational_methods that make tf role predictions using dna_binding our original method for predicting the roles of tfs starts with a pwm motif describing the dna binding_affinity of the tf we use the pwm to score the promoter_region of each gene in the genome for its likelihood to be bound by the tf we then use the resulting affinity scores to test each term in the gene_ontology go for association with high_scoring genes in contrast to other approaches e g that use an user specified affinity score threshold to separate tf target_genes from non targets we use the mannwhitney u test also known as wilcoxon_rank to determine if the genes associated with a particular go term have significantly high scores this method was implemented in the originalpage we have presented a comparative_genomics approach for assigning biological_roles to sequence_motifs using a form of gene_set the approach does not require multiple_alignments because role predictions are made independently for each comparative genome and then combined across genomes this means that the method does not assume that the location and orientation of binding_sites is conserved across species the method does require that orthologous_genes be identified in the species being utilized as would also be the case for a method employing multiple_alignments the approach also assumes that the functions of orthologous_genes and the dna binding_affinity of the regulatory molecule have been conserved in the species being used although the above assumptions are no doubt sometimes violated our comparative_genomics approach nonetheless substantially improves the sensitivity of tf role predictions our principal result is that it is possible to substantially_improve the prediction of the association of a dna binding_motif with an annotation term by mapping the annotation from a key species to related species and combining the association scores for a single motif and term across species the approach_requires only that we are able to compute the p value of the motif term association in each species and we combine across species by taking the geometric mean of the p values a simple permutation_test then assigns significance values to the combined motif term score since our method is alignment_free it avoids problems that would be caused by imperfect alignments or motif drift
