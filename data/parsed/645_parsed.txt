genome_analysis badirate estimating family turnover_rates by likelihood based_methods motivation the comparative_analysis of gene gain and loss rates is critical for understanding the role of natural_selection and adaptation in shaping gene_family sizes studying complete genome data from closely_related allows accurate estimation of gene_family turnover_rates current methods and software_tools however are not well designed for dealing with certain kinds of functional_elements such as micrornas or transcription_factor results here we describe badirate a new software_tool to estimate family turnover_rates as well as the number of elements in internal phylogenetic nodes by likelihood based_methods and parsimony it implements two stochastic population models which provide the appropriate statistical_framework for testing hypothesis such as lineage_specific gene_family expansions or contractions we have assessed the accuracy of badirate by computer simulations and have also illustrated its functionality by analyzing a representative empirical dataset availability badirate software and documentation is available fromit is generally_accepted that gene and genome duplications are a major evolutionary_mechanism for generating functional innovation the increasing availability of closely_related genome_sequences allows an accurate analysis of gene_family evolution such studies have shown that most families are highly_dynamic and evolve under a birth and death bd process indeed the comprehensive analysis of gene gains_and can provide_helpful insight into the role of natural_selection and adaptation in shaping gene family_size variation the stochastic bd model bdm implemented in the programs cafe and begfe allows estimating the family turnover_rate by maximum_likelihood ml and by bayesian_methods respectively this model nevertheless has some drawbacks first it assumes equal bd rates an assumption that may not hold secondly because duplicationsmodel li this model is nearly equivalent to that implemented in cafe except for the innovation parameter which allows the comparison between the two programs we have implemented three statistical frameworks to estimate family turnover_rates and the number of members in internal nodes maximum a posteriori map ml and parsimony see_supplementary likelihood based_methods have the advantage of contrasting biological relevant scenarios such as the identification of gene_families or specific lineages with extreme turnover_rates moreover the map approach allows the incorporation of prior biological_information without a large computational_cost badirate requires as input the established species phylogenetic_tree and a tab_delimited file with the family_size of each species represented in the phylogeny see badirates documentation
