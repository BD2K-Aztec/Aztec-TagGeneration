genome_analysis soapfusion a robust and effective computational fusion discovery tool for rna_seq motivation rna_seq provides a powerful approach to carry out ab ini tio investigation of fusion_transcripts representing critical translocation and post transcriptional_events that recode hereditary information most of the existing computational fusion detection_tools are challenged by the issues of accuracy and how to handle multiple mappings results we present a novel tool soapfusion for fusion discovery with paired_end rna_seq soapfusion is accurate and efficient for fusion discovery with high_sensitivity low false_positive even the coverage is as low as highlighting its ability to detect fusions efficiently at low sequencing cost from real_data of universal human reference rna uhrr samples soapfusion detected novel fusion_genes more than other existing_tools and all genes have been validated through reverse_transcription followed by sanger_sequencing soapfusion thus proves to be an effective method with precise applicability in search of fusion_transcripts which is advantageous to accelerate pathological and therapeutic cancer studies fusion_transcript the new transcript transcribed casually from two parental genes may emerge through chromosomal_rearrangements or intergenic splicing given their important roles in cancer_development some known fusions have been successfully used as biomarkers for development of inhibitors triggering cancer remission e g bcrabl fusion in treating chronic_myelogenous cml consequently it is of enormous biological and therapeutic_significance to locate such fusion_events early studies mainly resorted to expressed_sequence array_cgh or end sequence profiling to seek for fusions however such methods were largely constrained by their limited sequencing throughput and uneconomic cost with the emergence of next_generation rna_seq has been introduced as an excellent technique in fusion discovery and in particular paired_end pe sequencing was proved to exhibit distinguished strengths in both productivity and sensitivity the general idea of fusion_detection from rna_seq is to align all reads to a reference_genome or transcriptome and then explore alignments carrying potential fusion features to call fusions early computational detection approaches first narrow down regions containing possible fusions with pe reads intactly mapped to the reference and then search for the fusion junctions with remaining reads that mapped to those regions intactly nevertheless with successful application of segmental alignment strategy in some splicing junction detection_tools e g mapsplice and soapsplice a bunch of computational_approaches have been proposed including fusionseq shortfuse fusionhunter fusionmap defuse and tophat fusion to consider all segmental alignment of reads in addition to intact alignment these current methods vary in performance and ability in fusion_detection roughly speaking the performance of these methods rely on their ability to precisely detect the reads encompassing fusion junctions fusion reads as those reads served as the major evidences for fusion_events and could only be segmentally mapped to references to obtain specific fusion junctions current_tools align potential fusion reads to combinations of candidate exons e g fusionseq shortfuse fusionhunter fusionmap and defuse or split those reads into fixed segments for reference alignment e g fusionmap and tophat fusion this induces higher computational requirement on alignment and or not easy to solve segmental mapping problems such as to whom correspondence should be addressed
