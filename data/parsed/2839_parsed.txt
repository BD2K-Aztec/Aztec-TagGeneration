sequence_analysis measuring the distance between multiple_sequence motivation multiple_sequence msa is a core method in bioinformatics the accuracy of such alignments may influence the success of downstream_analyses such as phylogenetic_inference protein_structure and functional prediction the importance of msa has lead to the proliferation of msa methods with different objective_functions and heuristics to search for the optimal msa different methods of inferring msas produce different results in all but the most trivial cases by measuring the differences between inferred alignments we may be able to develop an understanding of how these differences i relate to the objective_functions and heuristics used in msa methods and ii affect downstream_analyses results we introduce four metrics to compare msas which include the position in a sequence where a gap occurs or the location on a phylogenetic_tree where an insertion or deletion indel event_occurs we use both real and synthetic data to explore the information given by these metrics and demonstrate how the different metrics in combination can yield more information about msa methods and the differences between them availability metal is a free software implementation of these metrics in haskell source and binaries for windows linux and mac os x are available from http kumiho smith man ac uk whelan software metal many methods used in bioinformatics require one or more accurate multiple_sequence msas as input each msa arranges a set of homologous amino_acid or nucleotide_sequences in a matrix where each column of the matrix corresponds to a set of characters that are homologous functionally_related or superposable in a protein_structure these definitions may coincide when the sequences are closely_related but may conflict as the sequences diverge methods of phylogenetic_tree structure_prediction functional_annotation and the creation of profile_hidden for database_searching all depend on an alignment and the performance of these methods depends inevitably on the accuracy of these alignments a variety of msa methods have been developed over the past_two that are still in active use including methods that co estimate trees and alignment to whom correspondence should be addressed these algorithms vary in their objective_function and the heuristic used to find the best msa the performance of msa methods is frequently assessed by their ability to recover a reference alignment e g which may be produced from biological_information such as a conserved_structure the output of each method can then be scored against the reference alignment either by the fraction of residue pairs in the reference alignment that are correctly_identified by a given method known as the sum of pairs sp score or by the total column tc score which describes the fraction of reference columns identified several studies have noted the effect of sequence_alignment algorithm on for example phylogenetic tree_topology many of these studies used simulated_data and the parameter of interest was generally assessed against alignment_quality measured as tc or sp score against the true alignment neither the tc nor the sp score are true metrics because they violate the principles of symmetry and the triangle inequality see below producing a valid metric would allow alignment to be projected as points in an alignment space enabling the comparison of distances between different msa methods or across different datasets when these comparisons include a reference alignment the metric would give some indication of the similarity of alignment_methods as well as an accuracy score alternatively such a metric could be used to characterize alignment uncertainty previous work on uncertainty has relied on annotating a best alignment with uncertainty information based on the proportion of base_pairs that are present when the sequences are reversed before alignment or when the guide_tree is varied a true metric could also provide direct comparison of equally or similarly high_scoring paths through the dynamic_programming matrix produced during msa allowing one to identify regions of high uncertainty in the final alignment in this study we derive four true metrics for the comparison of msas i a simple correction to the sp score ii a metric that incorporates raw gap information iii a metric that includes the position where gaps occur in a sequence and iv a metric that includes the position where insertion_deletion indel events occur both in a sequence and on a phylogenetic_tree we proceed to demonstrate that the sp and tp score are not metrics and cannot be used to investigate many questions about how msa methods perform we then show the usefulness of our metrics on msas produced by a selection of methods on real_data extracted from balibase and simulated_data produced using indelible through these analyses we also demonstrate that the combined use of our metrics can identify similarities and differences betweenpage
