bellman's gap a language and compiler for dynamic_programming in sequence_analysis motivation dynamic_programming is ubiquitous in bioinformatics developing and implementing non trivial dynamic_programming is often error_prone and tedious bellmans gap is a new programming system designed to ease the development of bioinfor_matics tools based on the dynamic_programming technique results in bellmans gap dynamic_programming are described in a declarative style by tree grammars evaluation algebras and products formed thereof this bypasses the design of explicit dynamic_programming recurrences and yields programs that are free of subscript errors modular and easy to modify the declarative modules are compiled into c code that is competitive to carefully hand crafted implementations this article introduces the bellmans gap system and its language gap l it then demonstrates the ease of development and the degree of re use by creating variants of two common bioinformatics algorithms finally it evaluates bellmans gap as an implementation platform of real_world bioinformatics_tools availability bellmans gap is available under gpl license from http bibiserv cebitec uni bielefeld de bellmansgap this web_site includes a repository of re usable modules for rna_folding based on thermodynamics
