isquest finding insertion_sequences in prokaryotic sequence fragment data motivation insertion_sequences iss are transposable_elements present in most bacterial and archaeal genomes that play_an in genomic evolution the increasing availability of sequenced prokaryotic_genomes offers the opportunity to study iss comprehensively but development of efficient and accurate tools is required for discovery and annotation additionally prokary otic genomes are frequently deposited as incomplete or draft stage because of the substantial cost and effort required to finish genome_assembly projects development of methods to identify is directly from raw sequence_reads or draft_genomes are therefore desirable software_tools such as optimized annotation system for insertion_sequences and iscan currently identify is elements in completely assembled and annotated genomes however to our knowledge no methods have been developed to identify iss from raw fragment data or partially assembled_genomes we have developed novel methods to solve this computationally challenging_problem and implemented these methods in the software_package isquest this software identifies bacterial iss and their sequence elementsinverted and direct repeatsin raw read data or contigs using flexible search parameters isquest is capable of finding iss in hundreds of partially assembled_genomes within hours making it a valuable high_throughput tool for a global search of is elements we tested isquest on simulated read libraries of complete bacterial_genomes and plasmids in genbank and were capable of detecting of the iss and transposases annotated in genbank with sequence_identity the ever increasing number of sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes provides an opportunity to understand their architecture and evolution however as new high_throughput methods are developed annotation quickly becomes the bottleneck for genomic_research in addition to open_reading orfs and regulatory_elements correct annotation of other features such as mobile_genetic mges is also essential these mges include bacteriophages conjugative transposons integrons unit transposons composite transposons and insertion_sequences iss such transposable_elements are defined as specific dna_segments that can repeatedly insert into one or more sites in one or more genomes iss are transposable_elements that are regarded as genomic parasites proliferating in their host and surviving only through horizontal_gene iss play_a in genome_evolution and plasticity mediating gene transfers and promoting genome duplication deletion and rearrangement insertion_sequences may be abundant in host genomes and are intimately_involved in mediating horizontal_gene generation of pseudogenes genomic rearrangement and alteration of regulatory_elements experimental_evolution in the laboratory has demonstrated that both and rearrangements can generate beneficial_mutations prokaryotic dde transposons mainly iss can move in two different ways depending on the donor_site replicative transposons copy their dna leaving the parent site intact while conservative transposons cut themselves out of the donor molecule in order to paste their dna into the target despite the development of various annotation programs for particular genomic_features some important features such as insertion_sequences iss the smallest and simplest autonomous mges remain poorly_annotated in many cases annotations of these elements include only orfs and ignore terminal inverted_repeats tirs which are an essential_feature of their activity in mediating gene_rearrangements moreover partial iss are rarely annotated leading to the loss of potentially valuable evolutionary_information another major_limitation of current_tools is the requirement of a complete annotated genome_sequence for is identification and analysis the majority of iss are between and bp and possess one or two orfs that encode transposases or helper proteins for an is element with more than one orf the first upstream orf encodes a dna_recognition domain while the second overlapping orf encodes the catalytic_domain there are two types of is iss carrying tirs elements and iss not carrying tir elements a tir is element carries a pair of partially conserved to bp inverted_repeats at its terminus for cleavage and binding of the transposase upon insertion iss often generate short directed repeats from to bp immediately outside the irs iss of the non tir type do not have discernible conserved inverted_repeats metagenomic_analysis has revealed that is transposases are among the most abundant and ubiquitous genes in nature based on transposase sequence_similarities iss have been classified in different families that belong to three main classes of enzymes dde transposases serine recombinases and tyrosine recombinases another recent classification of iss categorizes them into families based on transposase homology and overall organization with some families divided further into groups an is family can be defined as a collection of elements sharing conserved spacers between key_residues identical genetic organization similar terminal sequence arrangements and uniform target insertion behavior however not all families are so coherent consequently some e g families is and is are divided_into subgroups composed of a core of closely_related elements that can be linked to other members of the family by weaker but still significant similarities the naming convention of transposable_elements insertion_sequences transposons etc generally follows the recommendations of however in some cases a revised system of is naming is used based on a registry where researchers can request for a new sequence number to define novel mobile_elements is and transposable_element abundance in prokaryotes is highly_variable but they occupy a substantial fraction of some genomes for example and of the genome in clostridium_difficile and enterococcus_faecalis is composed of mobile_elements therefore it is estimated that an average of up to of bacterial and archaeal genomes are comprised of mges current is related software_tools such as iscan and optimized annotation system for insertion_sequences oasis operate only on complete_genomes with fully annotated orfs complete genome_assembly of a single strain of bacteria can be time consuming and costly due in large part to ambiguities introduced by repetitive_elements themselves consequently most publicly_available prokaryotic_genomes are deposited as incomplete contig or scaffoldlevel assemblies and is and other repetitive_elements may or may not be present in the deposited sequence for example celera wgs a widely used assembly software commonly moves full or partial is elements to a degenerates folder that is not frequently deposited as part of the draft_genome therefore to perform a global investigation of iss in unassembled prokaryote genomes we developed isquest or insertion_sequence quest a computational_tool for automated_detection of iss in unassembled or partially assembled_genomes isquest takes_advantage of widely available transposase annotations to identify candidate is seed regions and then uses a computationally_efficient extension method based on blast to grow the seed regions and identify the edges of each is element isquest is capable of finding mges in hundreds of genomes within hours making it a valuable high_throughput tool for a global search of is elements we applied isquest to sequenced bacterial_genome and plasmid sequences compared with the benchmark of genbank annotations isquest identified successfully with sequence_identity we performed two experiments to show the mge detection capability of isquest and present a summary of is sequences found by isquest classified by is family the performance of the isquest tool was compared with that of oasis using annotated transposases in genbank as a benchmark this first experiment compared the accuracy of isquest and oasis by measuring the percentage of genbank annotated iss found by each tool unlike isquest oasis operates on completely assembled and annotated genomes and uses only the annotation_information available in the genome isquest operates on partially assembled_contigs or directly on the raw_reads and does not require annotation to identify the orfs this experiment shows the predictive_capability of isquest to find iss from a draft and un annotated assembly and compares it to the predictive_capability of oasis using completely annotated sequences the capability of isquest to find other repetitive_elements e g rrna_operons is not measured in this experiment as isquest uses an un annotated draft_genome orfs are not clearly defined and finding the exact lengths of the mges is difficult using the seed extension algorithm therefore due to these inaccuracies the testing result inconsiders sequence_length match as a true_positive if isquest returns a sequence that matches a of the length of an annotated sequence in genbank with sequence_similarity we consider it a true_positive the count numbers in the figure represent is counts in single_copy multiple copies of a particular is are not included within the benchmarked genomes and plasmids isquest found of the unique genbank annotations whereas oasis found the genbank iss found both by isquest and oasis represent insertion_sequences with well defined inverted_repeats the sequences found by isquest and also present in genbank are full and partial transposase elements that do not contain completely defined inverted_repeats and therefore cannot be identified by oasis the annotations found only by isquest include partially assembled insertion_sequences and partial mges found by isquest that have not been annotated in deposited genomes these sequences may also include potential sets of new insertion_sequence and transposase elements identified by isquest based on sequence_similarity to other iss in genbank the intersection of isquest and oasis is zero as isquest cannot identify any sequence that has not been annotated in more than one genbank submission using the keywords transposase or insertion_sequence in the product field isquest does not take the annotated genome as input and therefore requires similar annotation to be present in other submissions we further evaluated isquest under increasingly strict constraints by increasing the length match threshold which we accept as a true_positive to and of the sequence_length shows the results of considering only sequences with greater than or equal to length matches with sequence_similarity with genbank sequences as valid true_positives of isquest we notice a slight reduction in the number of insertion_sequences detected by isquest to of the unique genbank annotations increasing the length match threshold to shows significant reduction in the number of insertion_sequences detected by isquest to however this shows that isquest is able to reproduce of the actual is sequence using the fast seed extension algorithm in the majority of cases
