structural_bioinformatics bion web_server predicting non specifically bound surface ions motivation ions are essential component of the cell and frequently are found bound to various macromolecules in particular to proteins a binding of an ion to a protein greatly affects proteins biophysical characteristics and needs to be taken into account in any modeling_approach however ions bounded positions cannot be easily revealed experimentally especially if they are loosely_bound to macromolecular surface results here we report a web_server the bion web_server which addresses the demand for tools of predicting surface bound ions for which specific interactions are not crucial thus they are difficult to predict the bion is easy to use web_server that requires only coordinate file to be inputted and the user is provided with various but easy to navigate options the coordinate file with predicted bound ions is displayed on the output and is available for download ions are important component for all living_cells and they are involved in different physiological_processes such as maintaining the osmotic balance and the general ionic environment of the cells participating in signal_transduction and many others because of that predicting ions positions is important for understanding various biological_reactions the need for predictions is dictated by the difficulties different experimental_techniques experience in determining surface bound ions as the residential time and the occupancy may not be large thus the signal could be weak although there are many approaches for predicting specifically bound ions as methods that are based on coordination_numbers of ions geometries binding_site preferences typical valence of metal_ions and many others to the best of our knowledge there is no web_server for non specifically bound surface ions predictions here we report such a web_server which is based on our new methodology using delphi and calculates the electrostatic_potential map in conjunction with an in house clustering_algorithm to predict non specific ion binding_sites this method is implemented into a web_server the bion web_server which allows predicting non specific bound ions on the surface of proteins it is easy to use and intuitive for broad range of users as result of calculations the user receives a file in protein data base pdb format of protein with predicted ions position ranked according to the confidence of the predictions
