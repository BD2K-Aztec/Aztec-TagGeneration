survcurv database and online survival analysis platform update understanding the biology of ageing is an important and complex challenge survival experiments are one of the primary approaches for measuring changes in ageing here we present a major update to survcurv a database and online resource for survival data in animals as well as a substantial increase in data and additions to existing graphical and statistical survival analysis features survcurv now includes extended mathematical mortality modelling functions and survival density plots for more advanced representation of groups of survival cohorts availability_and the database is freely_available at https www ebi ac uk thornton srv databases survcurv all data are published under the creative commons attribution license the biological_phenomenon of ageing has been a long_standing area of research despite identification of many gene knock outs drug_administration and environmental regimes that can extend lifespan of model_organisms under laboratory conditions many questions remain_unresolved a key experimental approach in research on ageing is to use longevity survival experiments which usually characterize differences with respect to ageing between populations when other causes of death such as predators food competition and pathogens are excluded until recently numerical_data from animal survival experiments were usually not shared and the data were analysed only in the original study hampering method development re analysis of existing data by new methods meta_analyses combining data and systems_biology approaches we have created the survcurv database and online analysis platform for animal survival data here we present a major survcurv update comprising improvements and new analysis features as well as increased data content
