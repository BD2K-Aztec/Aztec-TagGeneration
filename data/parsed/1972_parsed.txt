gene_ontology driven inference of protein_protein using inducers motivation proteinprotein_interactions ppis are pivotal for many biological_processes and similarity in gene_ontology go annotation has been found to be one of the strongest indicators for ppi most go driven algorithms for ppi inference combine machine_learning and semantic_similarity techniques we introduce the concept of inducers as a method to integrate both approaches more effectively leading to superior prediction_accuracies results an inducer ulca in combination with a random_forest compares_favorably to several sequence_based semantic_similarity and multi kernel approaches on a newly created set of high_quality interaction data the proposed_method high cross_species prediction_accuracies area_under rendering it a valuable companion to sequence_based availability software and datasets are available ata major_challenge in systems_biology is the accurate mapping of the interactomethe set of all protein_protein ppis within a cell understanding the interactome is essential in deciphering protein_function and cell_behavior large_scale interaction maps have been experimentally_determined but are incomplete and show high_error von consequently in silico methods have been developed to infer ppis from various sources of information including sequence_features such as n gram composition phylogenetic_relationships e g interologs and gene_ontology go annotation provide an excellent overview of features indicative for ppis several studies have recognized similarity in go annotation as one of the strongest_predictors for protein interaction go annotation driven interaction inference is based on the observation that proteins localized to the same cellular compartment are more to whom correspondence should be addressed likely to interact than are proteins that reside in spatially distant compartments similarly proteins that share a common biological_process or molecular_function have been found to be predictive for ppi go is organized as a graph with terms as nodes and edges describing relationships the literature distinguishes two fundamentally different approaches to exploit go annotation for the prediction of protein interactions i the semantic_similarity measure ssm approach and ii the machine_learning ml approach ssms are unsupervised methods that operate on a hierarchical graph dag of relationships to measure similarities between entities for instance similarity between go terms can be expressed by the shortest_path between terms within the go dag ml approaches for ppi inference on the other hand are supervised and the go annotation of a protein pair is encoded by a feature_vector indicating assigned or shared go terms which is subsequently evaluated by an ml classifier the ml approach has the advantage that advanced classification algorithms such as support_vector or random_forests can be applied which are usually more accurate predictors than unsupervised methods however the traditional encoding of shared go terms within the feature_vector ignores the relationships between go terms and therefore hides important information from the classifier the ssm approach on the other hand explicitly exploits topological relationships between go terms but is typically limited to comparatively simple predictors e g term probabilities these competing properties of the ssm and the ml approach have been recognized by many authors and hybrid methods have been developed in which the output of a ssm method serves as input among others to an ml classifier however the hybrid_approach still does not allow the classifier to exploit term relationships directly we hypothesized that a better integration of ssms with ml algorithms may lead to improved prediction_accuracies and we propose the concept of inducers to achieve such integration in the following we first discuss the various hybrid ml approaches and ssms before explaining inducers in section patil and nakamura trained a naive_bayes classifier using input_features such as shared go terms pfam domains and sequence_similarity to infer ppi shared go terms were also exploited byto identify novel interactions in human lin and many others utilize the information content of the most informative common_ancestor to measure term similarity edge based_methods on the other hand exploit the lengths of the paths between terms only a few authors have utilized ssms to infer ppis defined a similarity measure that is composed of three components such as overlap of induced term subgraphs term generality and term distances to lowest common_ancestors compared five ssms to predict human ppis and found resniks measure to perform best finally jain and bader introduced a novel ssm that attempts to compensate for the unequal depths of different branches of the go dag in an evaluation on a yeast ppi dataset the prediction_performance area_under was on par with resniks similarity_metric applications of ssms to other prediction_problems are referenced in section of the supplementary_material if not stated otherwise for all evaluations fold_cross was performed by splitting the dataset into parts training on parts testing on the remaining part and repeating this procedure for each part sample_sets were balanced with an equal number of positives_and prediction_accuracy was measured by the area_under auc or the auc up to the first false_positives auc we calculate auc where x k is the false_positive and y k is the true_positive for the k th output in the ranked_list of predicted confidence or similarity_scores generated by the classifier or ssm to reduce computation time ontology_terms that are obsolete or unused were removed from the dag provided they were not part of the sub dag induced by used terms first we evaluated the prediction_accuracy of the inducers introduced in section as described there induced term sets were projected onto a feature_vector and processed by a classifier naive_bayes was chosen as the underlying classifier since no optimization of parameter_settings is required and training is fast performance was measured on the sc yeast dataset due its large size and highquality interactions see section of supplementary_material for results on other datasets shows the prediction_accuracies of all inducers for the three ontologies strikingly all inducers that compute common_ancestors ca show higher prediction_accuracies than shortest_path sps spa and basic inducers ac al with the ulca method being the top performer but the results also reveal that it is not the lowest_common terms lcats alone that are responsible for the superior_performance first the accuracy of the olca inducer which generates lcats only is lower than that of the ulca method second terms along the paths from the original term sets up to but without the lcats are not sufficient for top performance either as the lower accuracy for the wlca inducer which excludes lcats indicates finally the combination of the original term sets and lcats as generated by the lca inducer is still inferior to the ulca method the prediction_accuracy of the shortest_path methods sps spa is slightly better than that of the basic inducer ac comparable to al but inferior to all common_ancestor methods ca note that within a tree_topology and for proteins annotated with single go terms the shortest_path inducer and the ulca inducer would be essentially equivalent in agreement with jain and bader we find that the predictive_power of the bp and cc ontologies is similar with a slight advantage for the bp ontology while the predictive_power of the mf ontology is considerably_lower as stated previously shortest_path and common_ancestor inducers resemble many ssms the main difference between inducers and ssms is that the former map induced terms on a high_dimensional feature_vector to be evaluated by a supervised classifier while the latter compute a single similarity value using an unsupervised_approach maximum max and average avg strategies were found to be inferior see section of supplementary_material found random_forests rf superior to nb classifiers and to achieve peak accuracies we combined the ulca inducer page go ppi comparison of the ulca inducer last three bars using an rf classifier with semantic_similarity jia sp on the sc dataset for all three ontologies bp cc mf results are fold cross_validated error_bars show sd with an rf to avoid possible bias we optimized the rf parameters trees depth max features on an independent dataset of chlamydia_trachomatis interactions extracted from the biogrid database and used nowhere else in this study the results show substantially_higher aucs of the inducer approach for all three ontologies compared with all ssms within the suite of ssms the gen and sp methods performed best closely followed by other ssms with the exception of the jia methods section of supplementary_material provides more detailed data in addition to ssms we furthermore compared the prediction_performance of the ulca inducer to state of the art machine_learning lists the auc and auc scores of five sequence_based a hybrid_approach and a go kernel in comparison to the ulca inducer with an rf classifier the inducer used an integration of the three ontologies to achieve the best performances see section of supplementary_material for details note that methods m m and c exploit sequence_information only and use svms as classifiers method m byutilizes trigram signatures as features m byrelies on the co occurrence of subsequences m byevaluates trigrams over a reduced amino_acid alphabet and m bycomputes auto correlation over seven physicochemical_properties to predict interactions method c byis a consensus over the methods m m the prediction_accuracies of all five methods were evaluated byon the yp dataset ben hur and noble employed a svm with a combination of various kernels derived from sequence_data go annotation network_properties and interolog information to predict ppis method ak indicates the case where all kernels were combined while method gok means that only the go kernel was used the latter measured the similarity between two proteins by computing the maximum log_likelihood over the common_ancestors of the go term annotations the inducer approach achieves substantially_higher aucs than all sequence_based m m including the consensus method c in comparison to ben hurs multi kernel method ak the inducer approach is inferior on the set of reliable interactions ab rel and slightly inferior to the go kernel alone gok on the same dataset on the full dataset ab the inducer performs substantially better than the go kernel gok section of the supplementary_material describes the comparisons above in more detail park also evaluated the cross_species accuracy by training a classifier on one species and predicting interactions for a different species he found the cross_species accuracy of the sequence_based predictors to be low for instance a fold_cross auc of was achieved on the yeast dataset and an auc of on the human dataset however when trained on yeast and applied to human the prediction_accuracy dropped from to displays the cross_species and self test accuracies auc of the ulca inducer with an nb classifier on the bp ontology over seven species results for other ontologies can be found in the section of the supplementary_material dark colors indicate low prediction_accuracies aucs and the values along the diagonal are the aucs of the self test training and test on the same dataset self test accuracy is not very useful in general but in case of an nb classifier which has a low vc dimension provides an optimistic but reasonable approximation of its maximum cross_validation accuracy apart from the three smallest ppi datasets dm at mm the cross_species accuracies of the go driven approach are good with aucs between up to the highest cross_species auc of was achieved for a predictor trained on the yeast sc and tested on escherichia_coli ec there is a clear trend for aucs below the diagonal of the matrix to be higher than the corresponding aucs above the diagonal indicating that the prediction_accuracy largely depends on the test_dataset target species and only to a lesser degree on the training_dataset source species consequently datasets with high self test accuracies lead to high test accuracies for all training_datasets while datasets linked to low self test accuracies e g mm result in low cross_species accuracies for example a classifier trained on human hs and tested on e coli ec achieves an auc of while a predictor trained on e coli and applied to human reaches an auc of only error_rates on the target species can be contributed to false interactions or false go annotations estimated error_rates as high as for iss evidence codes and for go page annotation from experimental_evidence high self test accuracies of an nb classifier indicate highly_consistent datasets on which a classifier can perform well since go annotation is essentially designed to be species independent a model trained on one species can be transferred and successfully be applied to a different species inducers encompass the traditional ml approach in which only the assigned go terms are mapped onto a feature_vector ignoring the go topology and also ssms for instance resniks ssm is effectively an olca inducer with a simple classifier utilizing information content as term weights numerous variants of resniks method with different aggregation strategies have been developed but for many applications do not achieve_higher accuracies reviewed ssms applied to biomedical_ontologies and in of studies resniks method with bma or max as aggregation strategy was identified as the best performer the ulca inducer presented here significantly_outperforms resniks method with bma max aggregation because the latter and most other ssms are unsupervised methods limited to simple estimators e g term probabilities while machine_learning are able to model higher order_statistics to confirm this we replaced the classifier component of the ulca inducer by the average or the maximum information content over the induced term set the resulting prediction_accuracies drop to the level of ssms section of supplementary_material the inducer approach outperformed the sequence_based method evaluated but it is noteworthy that patil and nakamura found sequence_similarity and go annotation to have low correlation r implying that a combination of go and sequence_based could lead to further improvements in prediction_accuracy while the cross_species accuracy of sequencebased methods is low they have the advantage of being applicable in cases where sequence_data but no further annotation is available e g newly_sequenced on the other hand annotation software such as blast go can be employed to transfer go terms to unannotated gene_products since annotation transfer is largely based on sequence_similarity as well it remains_an whether the superior accuracy of the inducer approach can be maintained in this case the computational_burden of the inducer based_approach can be alleviated by using a reduced term set a so_called go slim while slims lead to much shorter feature_vectors and therefore shorter prediction times they also reduce the prediction_accuracy considerably section of supplementary_material furthermore the mapping of go annotations to slim terms via map slim pl http search cpan org cmungall go perl scripts map slim is algorithmically more complex than the ulca inducer and also requires the selection of a suitable slim here we utilized a binary encoding to indicate the presence_or of shared go terms in an induced term set however the binary encoding cannot distinguish between the case in which a go term is assigned to only one protein and that in which it is assigned to none of the two proteins this loss of information can be avoided by using a ternary encoding e g for go terms assigned to one of the two proteins for go terms assigned to both proteins and otherwise we found the ternary encoding not beneficial for the ulca inducer but it considerably improved the accuracy of the al inducer section of supplementary_material it is known that ppi_networks contain many more non interactions negatives than interactions positives estimate a ratio of but as classifiers generally cannot be trained on sample_sets of this size balanced datasets are used instead ben performance is frequently measured by the auc to compare methods and by the auc as a practically relevant measure for experimental_validation of top ranking predictions we found the auc stable for different ratios but the auc highly volatile and less reliable section of supplementary_material in this work we introduce the concept of inducers to better integrate ml methods and ssms for the inference of ppis the inducer approach outperformed a suite of sequenced based_methods and ssms and achieved accuracies close to a multi kernel method that exploits information beyond mere go annotation on a high_quality yeast ppi dataset a peak prediction_accuracy of auc was achieved by the ulca inducer in combination with a rf classifier we also showed that the cross_species prediction_accuracy of the inducer approach is high auc when comparing the three individual ontologies of the go we found in agreement with other studies similarities in biological_process and cellular_component annotation to be stronger indicators for protein interaction than similar molecular function_annotation it is noteworthy that the proposed method is not specifically_designed for the prediction of ppis and can be applied to other domains described by ontological data considering the growing number of ontologies and their improving coverage formality and integration we expect
