a wide repertoire of mirna_binding prediction and functional_implications motivation over the past_decade deciphering the roles of micrornas mirnas has relied heavily upon the identification of their targets most of the targets that were computationally and experimentally_characterized were evolutionarily_conserved seedmicrornas mirnas have emerged as key_regulators of gene_expression exerting their regulatory_function post_transcriptionally by base_pairing with the mrna over the past_decade hundreds of mirna_genes have been to whom correspondence should be addressed discovered in metazoa plants and viruses while it has been demonstrated that quite a few of them have important roles in central cellular_processes reviewed in ref understanding these roles relies heavily upon identification of their target_genes consequently many experimental and computational efforts have been made to identify mirna_targets most of the first discovered mirna_targets exhibited evolutionary_conservation and full complementarity in their untranslated_region utr to a short sequence of nt in the region of the mirna termed seed reviewed in ref therefore the main features of mirna_binding that were initially used to predict mirna_targets were the presence of a seed and evolutionary_conservation of the site reviewed in ref these features narrowed the vast number of possible base_pairings between mrna utrs and mirnas and directed most research in the field to seed containing targets however two of the originally discovered mirna_targets in caenorhabditis_elegans as well as additional_targets identified along the years lacked perfect seed pairing but rather exhibited extensive base_pairing between the mrna utr and the mirna region termed compensatory sites furthermore the mirna binding options were recently expanded even further with the identification of centered sites functional mirna_binding that lack both perfect seed and compensatory pairing but exhibit extensive pairing between the mrna utr and the center region of the mirna all these additional types of sites were far less studied non evolutionarily_conserved targets can be predicted by several algorithms the compensatory targets are predicted by only few and no target prediction algorithm to date predicts centered sites see_supplementary s and supplementary consequently much is still unknown regarding the functionality and the biological_implications of these non conventional targets this shortage may be even more pronounced when targets of viral mirnas are considered as these mirnas are not evolutionarily_conserved and one of their first discovered cellular_targets based on reptars predictions contained a compensatory site here we provide a wide repertoire of targets obtained by our algorithm reptar which enables identification of targets with various binding types the set of reptars predictions includes
