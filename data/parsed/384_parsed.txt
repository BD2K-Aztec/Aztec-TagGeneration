a novel computational framework for simultaneous integration of multiple types of genomic_data to identify microrna gene regulatory_modules motivation it is well known that micrornas mirnas and genes work cooperatively to form the key part of gene_regulatory however the specific functional_roles of most mirnas and their combinatorial_effects in cellular_processes are still unclear the availability of multiple types of functional genomic_data provides unprecedented_opportunities to study the mirnagene regulation a major_challenge is how to integrate the diverse genomic_data to identify the regulatory_modules of mirnas and genes results here we propose an effective data_integration framework to identify the mirnagene regulatory comodules the mirna and gene_expression are jointly analyzed in a multiple non_negative framework and additional network data are simultaneously integrated in a regularized manner meanwhile we employ the sparsity penalties to the variables to achieve modular solutions the mathematical formulation can be effectively solved by an iterative multiplicative updating algorithm we apply the proposed method to integrate a set of heterogeneous_data including the expression_profiles of mirnas and genes on human ovarian_cancer computationally predicted mirnagene interactions and genegene_interactions we demonstrate that the mirnas and genes in of the regulatory comodules are significantly associated moreover the comodules are significantly_enriched in known functional sets such as mirna clusters go biological_processes and kegg_pathways respectively furthermore many mirnas and genes in the comodules are related with various cancers including ovarian_cancer finally we show that comodules can stratify patients samples into groups with significant clinical_characteristics micrornas mirnas play crucial regulatory_roles in repressing mrna_translation or mediating mrna_degradation by targeting mrnas in a sequence specific_manner mirnas transcriptional_factors and mrnas combine to form complex regulatory_systems cooperatively determining the progression to whom correspondence should be addressed of many cellular_behaviors and diseases great experimental and computational progress has been made on the problems of identifying which genes_encode mirnas predicting the target_genes of mirnas within multiple_genomes and characterizing mirna expression_patterns based on microarray_data in addition more and more labs are simultaneously producing expression_profiles of mirna and mrna on the same set of samples providing a global view on the dynamics of mirnamrna regulatory_relationships however the vast_majority of mirnas still have unknown_functions and the mechanisms driving cooperative regulation between mirna and genes are not yet well understood several exploratory studies have attempted to decipher how mirnas genes and proteins interact on a systems level e g global mirna regulation in cellular_networks or combinatorial mirna regulation in cellular_pathways other researchers have studied coordination between the transcriptional and mirna layers based on their combined regulatory_networks all these studies have provided insights into mirna gene_regulation for example by showing that mirnas tend to target highly_connected genes or proteins in cellular_networks however we are still far from understanding the underlying_mechanisms of mirna regulation and full scale studies of the regulatory_networks spanned by mirnas are only now getting under way recognizing the modular_organization of biological_networks has greatly_advanced of complex cellular_systems however little is known about the modules that exist in mirna gene_regulation systems and even less is known about these modules role in specific biological_processes and key regulation assemblies identifying_functional mirna gene regulatory_modules is a challenging_task for several reasons i one gene can be regulated by multiple_mirnas and one mirna can regulate a large_number given this multiplicity the target of our search has to be a mirna gene comodule a set of mirnas and their co regulated_genes ii the mirnamrna target relationships differ among tissues and conditions iii although mirnas physically interact with mrnas we applied the snmnmf method to identify mirna gene comodules by integrating_multiple independent data_sources the four matrices described in the section we set the reduced dimension of the matrix_factorization k to approximately_equal to the number of mirna clusters represented in our data see section we set the weight parameters and to and respectively see_supplementary the threshold t was set to after conducting a series of tests which are also described in the supplementary_material among the modules identified by the algorithm one was empty and therefore deleted and two contained only genes the mirna gene comodules identified in this study have an average of mirnas and genes per module the size distributions are shown in the supplementary_material and each module is described in detail on our website based on a distribution of correlations derived from randomized mirna gene comodules see section the anti correlations between mirnas and genes are statistically_significant in of the modules permutation_test with p value seeand supplementaryfor examples indicating that the probability of finding similarly anti correlated comodules by chance is close to zero mirnas play crucial roles in gene_regulation however little is known about the combinatorial regulations and cooperative mechanisms that occur between mirnas and genes the availability of mirna and gene_expression from the same patients mirna gene_networks and gene_interaction provides an unprecedented opportunity to discover and accurately characterize mirna gene regulatory comodules in this study we developed a flexible and effective framework that integrates these three data_sources to identify mirna gene regulatory comodules we tested the method on human data specifically ovarian_cancer from the tcga database the comodules reveal cooperation between mirnas and genes in several functions and phenotypes of cellular_systems and provide new insights into the transcript and post transcript regulatory organization of ovarian_cancer as genomic data_sources increase in volume and diversity our framework could provide new avenues for the systematic interpretation of combinatorial regulatory_mechanisms in this article we applied our snmnmf method to the specific problem of mirna gene comodule identification however the method is equally useful for many biological_problems requiring the integration of several types of inputs in particular it is suitable for problems involving multi_dimensional genomic_data profiling multiple variables on the same set of samples and independent priors identifying known relationships between the variables e g mirna gene and genegene relationships for example explored gene drug comodules based on gene_expression and drug response data from cancer samples however the quality of the modules obtained in that study suffered from the small number of samples and noisy input_data using our framework one could incorporate known genegene_interactions known genedrug relationships and even drugdrug similarities to improve the module discovery currently we observe an increasing trend toward generating multi_dimensional genomic_data including copy_number dna_methylation histone_modification mirna_expression and gene_expression data all profiled on the same set of samples at the same time we are gaining more and more knowledge regarding the associations between different genomic variables the new method described in this article can serve as a powerful framework for the simultaneous integration of diverse data to discover complex regulatory_patterns
