databases_and exptreedb web_based query and visualization of manually_annotated gene_expression experiments of human and mouse from geo motivation numerous public microarray_datasets are valuable resources for the scientific communities several online tools have made great steps to use these data by querying related datasets with users own gene_signatures or expression_profiles however dataset annotation and result exhibition still need to be improved results exptreedb is a database that allows for queries on human and mouse microarray_experiments from gene_expression with gene_signatures or profiles compared with similar applications exptreedb pays more attention to dataset annotations and result visu_alization we introduced a multiple level annotation system to depict and organize original experiments for example a tamoxifen treated cell_line experiment is hierarchically annotated as agent drug estro gen receptor_antagonist tamoxifen consequently retrieved results are exhibited by an interactive tree structured graphics which provide an overview for related experiments and might enlighten users on key items of interest availability_and the database is freely_available atcomparing gene_expression of cultured_cells tissues or other samples at different states or time points is a common strategy to search for key_factors or underlying_mechanisms in biological and medical studies over the past_decades commercial microarray_platforms have been used for global_gene and numerous profiling datasets have been produced gene_expression geo the public repository collecting microarray_datasets has included series datasets across organisms produced by microarrays these public datasets are valuable resources for biological medical and pharmaceutical studies to use large_numbers of public gene_expression a useful strategy is to connect datasets or experiments with similar or opposite gene_expression one important application of this strategy is to predict novel drug_repositioning candidates or promising bioactive_small the connectivity_map cmap project has generated a large number of gene_expression of human_tumor treated with over thousands of bioactive_small and systematically discovered potential connections among molecules genes and diseases on using the datasets of the cmap project iorio et_al found connections among drugs based on similarities of transcriptional_responses following drug_treatments several potentially repositioned drugs were predicted and verified i e topoisomerase inhibitors like sn and doxorubicin were repositioned to functional inhibition of cyclindependent kinase using similar strategy butte and his colleagues investigated the connections of global transcriptional_responses between diseases and small_molecule drug_compounds using rodent_models they predicted and validated that topiramate an anticonvulsant_drug might be effective in inflammatory_bowel ibd and cimetidine an antiulcer drug might be a previously_undescribed therapeutic for lung_adenocarcinoma several algorithms have been developed to quantitatively compare expression_profiles of global transcriptional_responses among these gene_set gsea based on the kolmogorovsmirnov statistic is a widely used method instead of individual genes gsea focuses on gene_sets sharing biological_functions or other information like chromosomal location and regulation specifically gsea compares a given gene_set with a ranked gene_list and provides scores and statistics to show how the gene_set is enriched at extremes top or bottom of the gene_list facilitated by these algorithms various online tools and resources have emerged the cmap as we described previously allows users to access and query with an algorithm later formalized in gsea molecular_signatures msigdb has included well annotated gene_sets from human and to whom correspondence should be addressed currently many other online applications querying gene_signature databases have been developed such as msigdb marq gem trend exalt and genechaser and provide users with great convenience a tendency of these types of applications is to cover more and more datasets and algorithms to quantify compared with these applications exptreedb exhibits a disadvantage in organism coverage human and mouse and data content human and mouse rrgls however previous_studies did not provide a well depicted standard for control_group or reference dataset selection which might make it difficult_to the perturbation inducing the cell response see example in supplementary_material raw gene_expression are also supported by exptreedb and the threshold of most upregulated and downregulated genes was chosen to generate signatures from these data though this threshold might not be suitable for datasets with very few differentially_expressed it could be applied to other datasets in most cases moreover previous applications generally exported retrieved results in a table list sorted by relevance with users query which might be inconvenient for browsing or finding items of interest msigdb classified gene_sets into seven major collections and several sub collections according to genes derivation including gene locations in chromosomes pathway genes and motif genes which is an approach essentially different from the experiment based classification in exptreedb in exptreedb gds records were manually examined to generate rrgls datasets without blank_control were excluded the stringent requirement for control_groups remarkably_decreased gds records included in exptreedb but ensured a clear biological_interpretation of perturbations inducing cell transcriptional_responses on top of that we implemented a multiple level annotation system for original experiments which greatly differed from other similar online applications the annotations briefly and comprehensively depicted experiment classifications and designs by this approach data within exptreedb were well organized and query results could be vividly visualized by an interactive and informative tree_structure therefore the multiple level annotation system could greatly improve users experience in result interpretation in all exptreedb is an online database for querying gene_expression of human and mouse derived from geo users can upload global gene_profiling data or gene_signatures to mine related previously_reported experiments exptreedb integrates a widely used algorithm and public gene_expression but characterizes itself by manually_annotated experiments and tree visualization of retrieved results we also have a plan to update the database repository by including geo series records in the next version of exptreedb
