systems_biology invex a web_based for integrative visualization of expression data gene_expression or metabolomics_data generated from clinical_settings are often associated with multiple metadata i e diagnosis genotype gender etc it is of great interest to analyze and to visualize the data in these contexts here we introduce invexa novel web_based that integrates the server side capabilities for data analysis with the browse based technology for data visualization invex has two key features i flexible differential_expression for a wide_variety of experimental_designs and ii interactive visual ization within the context of metadata and biological annotations invex has built in support for gene metabolite annotation and a fully_functional heatmap builder availability_and freely_available www invex ca contact omics_technologies such as microarrays next_generation and metabolomics are increasingly used in clinical studies in many cases a single dataset will be associated with multiple clinical parameters metadata such as diagnosis genotype gender and so forth it is of great interest to analyze and to visualize the data within these contexts as well as biological annotations to enable one to capture dynamic changes that correlate with clinical factors linear_models have proven to be a powerful and flexible_approach for analysis of gene_expression experiments however users need to have a deep_understanding of statistical concepts and r language to use this approach properly heatmaps have proven to be useful in visualizing expression data heatmaps coupled with clustering have become hallmarks for the presentation of gene_expression data however most web_based tools provide only static images with limited support for user interactions interactive_visualization is mostly limited to stand alone tools or java_applet plugin the rapid development of information_technology especially html and javascript has presented new opportunities to overcome_this here we present invex integrative visualization of expression data an intuitive web_based that seamlessly integrates server side capabilities for data analysis and annotation with the browse based technology for data visualization invex allows researchers to perform flexible data analysis and to visually explore the results as interactive heatmaps within the context of associated metadata and biological annotations
