data_and automatic semantic classification of scientific_literature according to the hallmarks of cancer motivation the hallmarks of cancer have become highly influential in cancer research they reduce the complexity of cancer into principles e g resisting cell_death and sustaining prolifera tive signaling that explain the biological capabilities acquired during the development of human tumors since new research depends crucially on existing knowledge technology for semantic classification of scientific_literature according to the hallmarks of cancer could greatly support literature_review knowledge_discovery and applications in cancer research results we present the first step toward the development of such technology we introduce a corpus of pubmed_abstracts annotated according to the scientific_evidence they provide for the currently known hallmarks of cancer we use this corpus to train a system that classifies pubmed literature according to the hallmarks the system uses supervised machine_learning and rich features largely based on biomedical_text we report good performance in both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations demonstrating both the accuracy of the methodology and its potential in supporting practical cancer research we discuss how this approach could be developed and applied further in the future availability_and the corpus of hallmark annotated pubmed_abstracts and the software for classification are available at cancer figures among the leading causes of mortality worldwide with c m new cases and m cancer related_deaths reported in the number of new cases is expected to rise by c over the next two decades making it more important than ever to develop effective tools for prevention detection and treatment of this disease new research into cancer draws on existing knowledge reported in scientific_literature relevant_literature has grown rapidly in both size and complexity there are over m citations related to cancer in pubmed www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed as many as were added over the past year the high number of potentially_relevant is a valuable source on to which new research can build but at the same time poses a challenge for scientists while applications such as google_scholar scholar google com and pubmed advanced search www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed advanced can be of help they fall short in providing all and only the information of interest to collect relevant_articles keyword based queries are the most common approach for literature retrieval however because of the complexity of scientific data in cancer research the massive number of keywords their synonyms and combinations exceeds what researchers can realistically handle for example a cancer researcher would not find all the literature about sustaining proliferative signaling by searching for proliferative signaling rather the use of hundreds of search_terms e g growth_factors growth_factor and cell_cycle would be required along with manual filtering of the search results it is an extremely time consuming task for researchers to read interpret select and structure data in an organized manner text_mining tm can provide more targeted methodology for identifying relevant_information in scientific_literature past_decades have seen a great development in biomedical tm that has made large_scale information_extraction ie and knowledge_discovery from literature possible and yielded impressive_results in real_life tasks to date the main emphasis of cancer centric tm work has been on tasks such as text classification and ie e g named_entity ner relation and event_extraction although only some of this work has been evaluated in context of real_life cancer research its enormous promises are evidenced by studies which have revealed new scientific_knowledge in text mined information that are not observable by informal data inspection in this article we introduce a tm technique for supporting semantic classification of scientific_literature for cancer research our classification is based on the hallmarks of cancer first introduced by hanahan and weinberg in an article that has been cited over times hallmarks are now widely_employed in cancer research a complex disease cancer involves genetic and epigenetic_alterations that affect a large_number proteins and signaling_networks during tumor_progression ten characteristics i e hallmarks of normal cells required for malignant_growth have been proposed that provide an organizing principle to simplify the diversity of the biological_processes leading to cancer these include i sustaining proliferative signaling ii evading growth suppressors iii enabling replicative immortality iv activating invasion and metastasis v inducing angiogenesis vi resisting cell_death vii deregulating cellular energetics viii avoiding immune destruction ix genome_instability and mutation and x tumor_promoting inflammation rationalizing the complexity in the underlying biological_processes hallmarks can help researchers gain a better understanding of the cellular_events leading to cancer the ability to identify important pathways within one or several hallmarks may also lead to the development of e g more effective cancer drugs within the bioinformatics community hallmarks have inspired harvesting interactions between genes and proteins and relations between environment and cancer from high_throughput omics_data and scientific_literature the latter work has led into the development of ontology tools e g oncocl and oncosearch for discovery of information related to specific proteins genes or cancers within biomedical tm some research has been conducted on identifying hallmark based processes i e events in biomedical_literature this work has been based on the initial hallmark classification of and it has focused on a set of events known to be relevant for the cancer genetics domain since hallmarks involve complex processes relevant scientific data are diverse and difficult to harvest using standard search techniques what is ideally needed is powerful technology which categorizes and ranks data in literature on the basis of their relevance for hallmarks exploration of the resulting semantically structured data could help scientists find relevant_information faster make links between otherwise unconnected articles and create summaries and novel hypotheses from the scientific_literature we present here a tm technique capable of such large_scale semantic classification of pubmed literature according to the current hallmarks of cancer we first introduce a corpus of cancer related pubmed_abstracts which we have annotated according to the evidence they provide for hallmarks we show that the annotations are accurate and that the corpus is representative we then report experiments where the corpus is used as training and test data for automatic hallmark classification of literature our machine_learning approach is based_on svm and employs a rich set of features based on natural_language nlp and existing resources we present direct and task based evaluation of the classification which demonstrates both the accuracy of the approach and its usefulness in supporting cancer research we discuss future development and applications of our methodology the evaluation reported above demonstrates the accuracy and the practical potential of hallmark based text classification we report here further analysis to gain insight into the errors made by the classifier and how to improve our approach in the future we first looked into multi labeling as listed in of the abstracts in our annotated corpus are multi labeled displays the proportion of abstracts in the corpus according to the percentage of matched hallmark labels for a given abstract in the classifier output of abstracts have of their labels correctly_predicted by the classifier while have no matches of their labels the high percentage of matched and matched can be attributed to of the abstracts having a single label we next examined the actual hallmark pair co occurrences i in the annotated corpus where the diagonal line shows the number of occurrences for a given hallmark in the corpus independent of other co occurring hallmarks and ii as predicted by the classifier looking at hallmarks that most often co occur with each other include sustaining proliferative signaling ps resisting cell_death cd and evading growth suppressors gs with abstracts labeled as ps and cd and abstracts labeled as ps and gs these co occurrences could be explained by the fact that they are all related to cell_cycle for example in the sentence moreover harmine not only induced endothelial cell_cycle but also suppressed endothelial_cell and tube_formation as well as induction of neovascularity in a mouse corneal micropocket assay the phrase cell_cycle is a good indicator of ps and gs and the word apoptosis is a good indicator of cd this might be explained by overlapping capabilities e g cell_growth and is likely to be the main_reason for the lower classifier performance figures for these three hallmarks in looking at for many hallmarks the predicted co occurrences are well correlated with those in the annotated corpus for example ps and cd are co classified times which is relatively comparable to their co occurrences in the corpus similar observations can be made with regard to ps and gs our current approach is based on training independent binary classifiers to predict whether an abstract belongs to a given hallmark category we could also experiment with models that allow the classifiers to work together e g models based on joint inference or joint learning this type of methodology which has been successfully_applied to similar nlp tasks is likely to improve performance as it provides the means to capture dependencies and interactions between co occurring hallmarks the first two case studies provide additional evidence that our system correctly classifies literature over the hallmarks of cancer the automatic system rapidly generated profiles that would have been difficult and very time consuming to produce manually which would facilitate overviews of scientific_literature in the future the approach may be further developed to support the detection of novel patterns and research hypotheses in literature the last two case studies show that our approach can support information_retrieval in comparison with a search string intersection query where the goal is to identify documents for a given topic as well as articles that relate specifically to certain hallmarks our approach generally identifies more documents and has a smaller percentage of false_positives than standard keyword based search this can perhaps be explained by the latent nature of the hallmarks in textsthe fact that they are rarely stated explicitly but rather via indirect correlation of terms that describe relevant biological_processes and therefore are not easily found by basic keyword_search our case studies also demonstrate that experts selecting the wrong set of search_terms may result in a high number_of and that our classifiers are not susceptible to this problem since they are trained on a large number of features and not on the occurrence of a single search_term our analysis also suggests that many hallmarks could be subdivided e g according to the established pathways involved in the distribution of all abstracts according to the percentage of their correctly_predicted hallmarks hallmark co occurrence distribution in the annotated corpus tumor development during cancer development aberrantly regulated intracellular_signaling tend to rearrange networks regulating cancer_cells and the networks themselves can be divided_into sub circuits which regulate certain capabilities of cancer_cells e g viability circuit we are currently developing such an enriched classification of hallmarks so as to help cancer researchers navigate more easily to the literature of their specific interest however whether the more subtle differences between subcategories of hallmarks can be captured by machine_learning is yet to be known and we plan to investigate that in due time
