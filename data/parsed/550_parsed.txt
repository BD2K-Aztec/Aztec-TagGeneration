systems_biology a stochastic automaton model for simulating kinesin processivity motivation cellular_interactions of kinesin an adenosine triphos phate atp driven motor_protein capable of undergoing multiple_steps on a microtubule mt affect its mechanical processivity the number of steps taken per encounter with mt even though the processivity of kinesin has been widely_studied a detailed study of the factors that affect the stepping of the motor along mt is still lacking results we model the cellular_interactions of kinesin as a probabilistic timed automaton and use the model to simulate the mechanical processivity of the motor theoretical_analysis suggests i backward stepping tends to be powered by atp_hydrolysis rather than atp_synthesis ii backward stepping powered by atp_synthesis is more likely to happen with limiting atp_concentration atp at high_loads and iii with increasing load the frequency of backward stepping powered by atp_hydrolysis at high atp is greater than that powered by atp_synthesis at limiting atp together the higher frequency of backward stepping powered by atp_hydrolysis than by atp_synthesis is found to be a reason for the more dramatic falling of kinesin processivity with rising load at high atp compared with that at low atp simulation_results further show that the proces sivity of kinesin can be determined by the number of atp_hydrolysis and synthesis kinetic cycles taken by the motor before becoming inactive it is also found that the duration of a backward stepping cycle at high_loads is more likely to be less than that of a forward stepping cycle contactkinesin is an adenosine_triphosphate atp driven motor_protein that walks in an asymmetric hand over hand fashion on a microtubule mt in discrete nm steps mechanical processivity of kinesin has revealed that the motor takes multiple_steps in the forward_direction i e to the plus end of mt and occasionally in the backward direction i e to the minus end of mt before detaching from mt in the presence of atp or in the absence of atp if external load is applied to the motor processivity of kinesin ensures that cellular cargos are transported reliably over long_distances processive stepping of kinesin exerts localized forces on nanostructures which can be exploited in nanorobotics by inventing artificial nanomotors and thus synthetic nanodevices powered by the motor this stepping is also manipulated in the controlled propagation architecture of nanonetworks whose information molecules are carried by kinesin motors between transmitter and receiver nanomachines synthetic nanodevices and nanonetworks are anticipated to contribute in medical_diagnostics as well as engineering applications despite this progress artificial nanomotors still lack the functionality and efficiency of their biological counterparts processivity of kinesin_motor and thus its mean run length i e the distance that the motor travels before detaching from mt is correlated to the cellular_interactions of the motor yet little is known about how this motor can remain attached to mt through the hundreds of stepping cycles a better understanding of the cellular_interactions of kinesin would provide new insights into the mechanical processivity of the motor recently we developed a mathematical_model that simulates the behaviour of kinesin stepping we showed that the model could be used to analyse and predict forward and backward stepping of kinesin_motor at different atp concentrations and loads on the basis of our findings in here we aim to model the stochastic behaviour of a single kinesin molecule by constructing a probabilistic timed automaton based on a discrete stochastic_model of the motor at variousand loads the probabilistic timed automata pta are mathematical_models augmented with time and discrete probability_distributions for modelling the temporal and stochastic properties of stochastic discrete event systems our proposed automaton model shows that the mean run length of kinesin at differentand loads can be determined by the number of atp_hydrolysis and synthesis kinetic cycles taken by the motor before detaching from mt
