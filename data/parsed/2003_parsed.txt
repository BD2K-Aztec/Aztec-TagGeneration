genomation a toolkit to summarize annotate and visualize genomic_intervals biological_insights can be obtained through computational integration of genomics data_sets consisting of diverse types of information the integration is often hampered by a large variety of existing file_formats often containing similar information and the necessity to use complicated tools to achieve the desired results we have built an r package genomation to expedite the extraction of biological_information from high_throughput data the package works with a variety of genomic interval file types and enables easy summarization and annotation of high_throughput data_sets with given genomic_annotations availability_and the software is currently distributed under mit artistic license and freely_available bioinformatics mdc berlin de genomation and through the bioconductor framework genomic_intervals are the basis of genome_annotation and are widely used in short read_alignments where an interval represents the location of an aligned read in addition intervals can contain a variety of scores with different scales such as conservation percent methylation and chip_seq enrichment summarization of these information rich intervals over different sub genomic contexts promoters exons enhancers etc is the necessary first step in making inference about the biological_importance of the data throughout the text we use the phrase genomic annotation to refer to the regions of the genome associated with a potential function or regions of interest which do not necessarily have a score examples cpg islands genes enhancers promoter exons etc these genomic_annotations provide anchor points and the general distribution of genomic_intervals at and in vicinity to these annotations can assist in biological_interpretation of the data in order to facilitate the extraction of knowledge from genomic_intervals we have developed the r package genomation this package is a toolkit for annotation and bulk summarization and visualization of genomic_intervals over predefined genomic_annotations genomation is designed to work with genomic_intervals stored either in i arbitrarily formatted text_files containing minimal information about the chromosome start and end or ii in compressed formats such as bam and bigwig the package provides functions for computing fast summary_statistics about the level of association of genomic_intervals with the desired annotation and enables simultaneous visualization of multiple highthroughput experiments over regions of interest through parallel heatmaps meta region meta gene meta promoter etc plots coverage distribution profiles and pie charts for overlap with annotation_features summarized in in addition the data_structures used in the package can easily be integrated to other analysis in r bioconductor which provides a multitude of possibilities for downstream_analysis genomation is a versatile toolkit for interrogating diverse types of genomic_intervals with or without scores it significantly_reduces the time needed for data_processing and biological inference by providing a multitude of convenience functions for annotation summarization and visualization of genomic_intervals complementing and extending capabilities of similar tools written in other languages we believe this r package will be a welcome addition to a bioinformaticians toolbox in addition the data_structures used in the package can easily be integrated to other analysis in r bioconductor a comprehensive_overview of the capabilities is included in package vignette available at http goo gl vhtexn
