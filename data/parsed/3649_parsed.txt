predicting protein interactions via parsimonious network history inference motivation reconstruction of the network level evolutionary_history of proteinprotein_interactions provides a principled way to relate interactions in several present day networks here we present a general framework for inferring such histories and demonstrate how it can be used to determine what interactions existed in the ancestral networks which present day interactions we might expect to exist based on evolutionary evidence and what information extant networks contain about the order of ancestral protein duplications results our framework characterizes the space of likely parsimonious network histories it results in a structure that can be used to find probabilities for a number of events associated with the histories the framework is based on a directed hypergraph formulation of dynamic_programming that we extend to enumerate many optimal and near optimal solutions the algorithm is applied to reconstructing ancestral interactions among bzip transcription_factors imputing missing present day interactions among the bzips and among proteins from five herpes_viruses and determining relative protein duplication order in the bzip family our approach more accurately reconstructs ancestral interactions than existing_approaches in cross_validation tests we find that our approach ranks the majority of the left out present day interactions among the top and of possible edges for the bzip and herpes networks respectively making it a competitive approach for edge imputation it also estimates relative bzip protein duplication orders using only interaction data and phylogenetic tree_topology which are significantly correlated with sequence_based estimates availability the algorithm is implemented in c is open_source and is available atimproved techniques for understanding how collections of protein interactions have evolved over time have a number of applications for example they can help identify stable and rewired modules and protein_complexes the quality of inferred networks under various parameters can help estimate the probabilities of different evolutionary_events or correct for phylogenetic branch_lengths ancestral network_reconstruction has been explored to improve network_alignment the study of ancestral metabolic_pathways can reveal how changes in metabolic_pathways relate to changes in the environment zhang and apply network evolution inference to improve inference of regulatory_networks in present day species previous_algorithms for network history reconstruction include the use of graphical_models greedy local_search and extensions thereof maximum_likelihood inference and other approaches introduced a new parsimony framework that modeled the problem as one of finding the fewest number of interaction gain_and that reconstruct the observed present day networks many of these previous_approaches find only one possible network history and make inferences based on that single history however there may be a large number of optimal and near optimal histories a priori we do not know how different these solutions may be or how representative of the ensemble the solution at which we arrive is further although maximum likelihoodbased approaches do not necessarily produce a single history suggest that such estimators may not generally characterize the posterior weighted ensemble of solutions well a maximum_likelihood network history inference_method has been applied to the problem of predicting regulatory_interactions in present day networks however that approach_requires a known complete ordering of the duplication_events in each homology group which our approach does not further being based on a parameterized network evolution model it requires the estimation of numerous model_parameters to overcome_these we present an approach based on a novel algorithm and advanced dynamic_programming techniques which is able to efficiently characterize the relevant portion of the space of network histories without resorting to sampling by formulating our dynamic program in the forward hypergraph framework it becomes clear how to explore the space of solutions we develop an extension of the k best parsing algorithm ofthat allows us to aggregate solutions of equivalent quality as a result rather than enumerating individual solutions we are able to enumerate solution classes i e the set of all solutions having the same cost and provide a characterization of the space of optimal and nearoptimal solutions to an instance of the network history inference problem inspired by we call this method a sum over parsimonious histories soph approach to to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by

for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com ancestral network_reconstruction although related to certain approaches in natural_language our approach for generating a weighted ensemble of parsimonious solutions is novel and may also prove useful in other areas of computational_biology for every potential interactioneither ancestral or extant our algorithm computes the posterior_probability summed over an ensemble of parsimonious and near parsimonious histories which the interaction exists we show this approach outperforms the graphical_model formulation used in pinney et_al and dutkowski and tiuryn further as posterior_probabilities are provided for all potential interactions including extant ones that participate in the ensemble we are able to impute missing interactions and to quantify the consistencyin terms of evolutionary parsimonyof a given set of interactions when applied to the problem of predicting ancestral interactions among bzips the soph approach is particularly beneficial when noise is added to the present day networks these noisy networks simulate the common scenario in which the measurement of present day interactions is error_prone the soph method seems to be both accurate and robust further anecdotally argue that the interaction between kshv proteins ul and ul is highly_conserved across many herpes species and we find that our soph approach predicts an ancestral interaction between the orthology groups of these proteins with the second highest probability among all potential ancestral interactions we test the approachs ability to predict missing edges in present day networks and we show that it often outperforms a state of the art approach for edge prediction based on network_topology on the bzip transcription_factor network where we perform leave_one fold and fold_cross we find that our approach most often puts edges from the test_set in the top of the probabilities assigned to pairs we also perform edge prediction on a collection of five herpes_virus protein_interaction in a similar leave_one setting the data are too sparse for higher fold_cross here the left out edge is on average in the top of high_probability edges we also breakdown performance based on which orthology groups the interaction participants are members of and find that the good performance is driven by generally good performance for most pairs of orthology groups as these data are believed to have highfalse negative rate there surely are real missing edges in the given present day networks meaning the actual_performance is likely in fact better the ensemble of parsimonious network histories encoded by our framework can be used to answer other types of queries about the network histories that are not even possible in existing maximum_likelihood approaches that work based on interaction trees as an illustration we use the soph framework to predict the relative duplication order between pairs of ancestral bzip proteins existing maximum_likelihood approaches cannot perform this task as a total order of duplication_events is required for the inference procedure used by those algorithms we find that the relative duplication orders predicted by our soph framework which were predicted without the use of phylogenetic branch length information are significantly correlated with the duplication order derived from the protein_sequences we now describe the performance of the soph framework for the three inference tasksancestral network_reconstruction missing interaction imputation and determination of relative protein duplication orderset forth in section we have introduced a novel sum over histories method for solving the network history inference problem it addresses shortcomings of existing_methods by using a weighted ensemble consisting of all optimal and near optimal parsimonious histories we show that this makes the results robust to the presence of noise in the input section and allows our parsimony approach to outperform the probabilistic_approach to ancestral network_reconstruction at all considered noise levels the algorithms we present have practical running_times our implementation required only min to computein serial the results for all cross_validation experiments on the herpes_virus datasets an average of s per experiment on the significantly_larger bzip dataset the algorithm requires and s respectively to compute solutions using the top and cost classes suggesting an empirically linear relationship between the running time and the number of requested cost classes the sum over histories approach is also general and allows many other questions to be answered about how a sequence of proteins and their interactions have evolved we find that our method can reliably exploit evolutionary evidence to discover the existence of missing interactions soph may be useful in prioritizing low_throughput but high_accuracy protein interaction experiments by suggesting which interactions are more likely than others to exist given the current experimental and evolutionary evidence the soph approach also recovers the ultrametric temporal ordering relationships between duplication_events well without using any direct information about sequence or branch_lengths
