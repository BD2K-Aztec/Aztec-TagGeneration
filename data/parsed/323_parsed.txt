an empirical comparison of several recent epistatic interaction detection methods motivation many new methods have recently been proposed for detecting epistatic_interactions in gwas data there is however no in depth independent comparison of these methods yet results five recent methodsteam boost snpharvester snpruler and screen and clean sc are evaluated here in terms of power type_error scalability and completeness in terms of power team performs best on data with main effect and boost performs best on data without main effect in terms of type_error team and boost have higher type error_rates than snpruler and snpharvester sc does not control type_error well in terms of scalability we tested the five methods using a dataset with snps on a bit ubuntu system with intel r xeon r cpu ghz gb_memory team takes days to finish and snpruler reports heap allocation problems boost scales up to snps and the cost is much lower than that of team sc and snpharvester are the most scalable in terms of completeness we study how frequently the pruning techniques_employed by these methods incorrectly prune away the most significant epistatic_interactions we find that on average of datasets without main effect and of datasets with main effect are pruned incorrectly by boost snpruler and snpharvester availability the software for the five methods tested are available from the urls below a genome_wide gwas examines the association between phenotypes and genotypes in a study group the first exciting finding was on age_related amd which uncovers a disease allele tyrosinehistidine polymorphism with an effect_size of in single_nucleotide snps since then over gwass have been conducted for diseases and traits to whom correspondence should be addressed and associated snps have been reported the methodologies of these studies are similar a quality_control criteria is first defined to filter the genotype data then the remaining genotypes are each tested for association with the disease_phenotypes finally the significant snps are reported after multiple_testing most of these gwass could only identify disease alleles with moderate_effect thus single snp association studies could explain very limited heritability of these diseases consequently researchers have started exploring multi snp interactions in the hope of discovering more significant associations multi snp interactions are also called epistatic_interactions this term originated from batesons definition of epistasis ago it was defined as the change of segregation ratio and the interaction of genes however in the current_literature there is a debate on the exact definition of epistasis our article focuses on evaluating epistatic interaction detection methods in their computational aspect and all the experiments are based on simulation_data thus we consider epistatic_interactions as the statistically_significant associations of k snp interaction k with phenotypes there are mainly two types of epistatic interaction detection methods model based_methods and model_free in general model based_methods predefine a statistical_model between phenotypes and genotypes then they fit the data to the model and finally they output the significant snps they work well for only a small number of important and filtered candidate snps but they often fail when the number of snps grows to hundreds of thousands to make model based_methods more efficient researchers have proposed a variety of heuristic and filtering techniques for example a develop an upper_bound of the likelihood_ratio test_statistic for two locus epistatic interaction to prune the search_space and a boolean transformation of data to make collection of contingency_table information faster as another example devise a two stage analysis so that the overall analysis is more efficient as a third example use a stochastic_search to identify only set by the user_groups of candidate epistatic_interactions for follow_up model_fitting analysis in contrast model_free have no prior assumption on the data and the model given the genotype data these methods only examine the test_statistic of each possible epistatic interaction with phenotypes propose a minimum_spanning mst structure to represent the data by traversing this mst exhaustivecompare only approaches based on neural_networks while our selected methods cover both data_mining and statistical_methods second evaluate multifactor_dimensionality mdr grammatical evolution neural_networks genn focused interaction testing framework fitf random_forests rf and logistic_regression lr methods they show that mdr is superior in all settings after years of advancement most methods selected in this article have demonstrated that their performance is better than that of mdr we therefore omit discussing methods mentioned in motsingercompare ambience with mdr restricted partitioning method rpm and logistic_regression they conclude that the performance of ambience is equivalent to that of logistic_regression for two locus models and better than that of rpm and mdr however according to the performance of boost is better than that of plink which uses a pure logistic regression_model therefore we omit the evaluation of ambience and rpm in our study lastly have shown that their overall performance is much better than that of beam we thus omit beam in this article we give an independent empirical comparison of five methods for detecting epistatic interactionsnamely team boost snpruler snpharvester and screen and clean to help users better understand which method is more suitable for their data which method is good for detecting epistatic_interactions with and without main effect and which method is scalable to larger datasets we also analyze why combining several of these methods cannot enhance power their basic_characteristics are given in the organization of this article is as follows we first formulation the problem in section then we briefly introduce each of the five methods in section we describe how the evaluation data is simulated in section and the detailed setting of each experiment in section after that we present the results under each setting in section finally we discuss the performance of each method and provide advice to users in section the five methods all demonstrate respective utilities through the experiments results above no single method is simultaneously the most powerful the most scalable and has the lowest type_error in every setting when users want powerful results and are not concerned with computation cost we recommend using team and boost compared with team boost uses a model_fitting procedure if the data fits the model well the result is usually good page the four methods on data with and without main effect in a there are in total datasets for settings of the simulated_datasets which corresponds to ground_truth among these ground_truth only of them can be detected by at least one of the four methods while the best methodteamidentifies ground_truth out of this explains why using ensemble methods cannot outperform team similar observation is illustrated in b otherwise a model free method may be the alternative choice when users expect moderate running time and power we recommend using snpruler its pruning technique helps reduce running time albeit at the risk of losing power if users are conscious of computation cost and have to run very large_datasets we recommend using snpharvester because it only identifies a small number of groups for the model_fitting procedure our evaluations are based on simulation_results in a real study users usually have no idea of the ground_truth in the dataset hence it may not be sufficient to rely only on one method to obtain results we suggest that if time and computation resources permit users try both the recommended model free i e team and model_fitting i e boost methods it is tempting to consider taking a majority vote of the results of two or more methods for example let every algorithm report their top three predictions an snp pair receives k votes if it is reported by k methods we select the one with the highest vote as the final prediction when there is a tie we choose the one with the lowest p value unfortunately for both types of data tested we find that an ensemble using such a strategy cannot increase power over using solely boost or team in we see that for data without main effect boosts ground_truth predictions highly overlap with the other three methods so any ensemble cannot contribute a significant number of new ground_truth predictions specifically the proportion of boosts ground_truth predictions that are not predicted by the other three methods is while the proportion of the other methods ground_truth predictions not predicted by boost is similarly for data with main effect no ensemble can outperform team our evaluations above only focus on two locus epistatic interaction recently provide a general model that can be extended to n locus epistasis they also provide mathematical details of dissecting the test into different epistatic components for example two way epistatic interaction can be partitioned into four epistatic components additive additive additive dominant dominant additive and dominant dominant this helps characterize epistatic_interactions in a more specific way and provides more physiological insights
