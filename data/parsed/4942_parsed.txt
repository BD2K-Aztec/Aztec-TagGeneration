xpiwit an xml pipeline wrapper for the insight toolkit the insight toolkit offers plenty of features for multidimensional image_analysis current implementations however often suffer either from a lack of flexibility due to hard coded c pipelines for a certain task or by slow execution times e g caused by inefficient implementations or multiple read write operations for separate filter execution we present an xml_based wrapper application for the insight toolkit that combines the performance of a pure c implementation with an easy to use graphical setup of dynamic image analysis_pipelines created xml pipelines can be interpreted and executed by xpiwit in console mode either locally or on large_clusters we successfully_applied the software_tool for the automated analysis of terabyte scale time resolved d image data of zebrafish_embryos availability_and xpiwit is implemented in c using the insight toolkit and the qt sdk it has been successfully compiled and tested under windows and unix based systems software and documentation are distributed under apache license and are publicly_available for download at https bitbucket org jstegmaier xpiwit downloads automated analysis of large_scale multidimensional image data has become an integral part of current biological_research particularly d imaging_techniques like confocal light_sheet or electron_microscopy easily produce terabytes of image data that cannot be assessed manually although many comprehensive and user_friendly graphical_user guis for the automation of image_analysis problems have been presented in the past their applicability to terabyte scale data remains_limited on the other hand tools that are usable for large_scale analyses are mostly single purpose command_line with a substantial lack of flexibility the insight toolkit itk for instance often serves as a basis for such specialized highperformance implementations as it offers plenty of features for multidimensional image_analysis and has an active community in the biomedical_field that constantly improves and extents the functionality of itk however many available solutions based on itk require advanced programming_skills are limited to a certain task due to specialized c pipelines or suffer from slow execution times e g caused by multiple i o operations for separate filter execution or inefficient implementations to overcome_these we developed xpiwit an xml_based wrapper application for itk that allows a graphical setup and rapid_prototyping of image analysis_pipelines while preserving the performance of a pure c implementation supplementary created xml pipelines can directly be used to interface xpiwit on large_clusters and the current version of xpiwit already incorporates about different filters including i o filters preprocessing filters edge detectors morphological operators and segmentation filters supplementary we also integrated our recently_published algorithm for the efficient segmentation of fluorescently_labeled cellular nuclei as an exemplary pipeline xpiwit can be constantly extended with new functionality we created template files that facilitate the implementation of new filters for xpiwit filters that are already implemented as image to image filters in itk can be added to xpiwit in a matter of minutes and are instantly accessible via the xml interface because of the flexible design literally any additional c code can be encapsulated as an xpiwit filter as long as the input and output images are appropriately casted to itk internal types the platform independent opensource software_tool was successfully_applied to automatically analyze_multiple terabytes of time resolved d microscopy image data in embryomics using a hadoop cluster supplementary section s
