gene_expression annotare a tool for annotating high_throughput biomedical investigations and resulting data computational_methods in molecular_biology will increasingly depend on standards based annotations that describe biological_experiments in an unambiguous manner annotare is a software_tool that enables biologists to easily annotate their high_throughput experiments biomaterials and data in a standards compliant way that facilitates meaningful search and analysis availability_and annotare is available frommeta data_describing high_throughput investigations enable unambiguous interpretation of experiments experiment reproducibility and meaningful searching and analysis of the resulting data the microarray community has developed mage tab an annotation format for microarray_data mage tab allows laboratories to manage exchange and publish wellannotated biomedical data using a spreadsheet based paradigm several public_repositories and analysis tools for microarray_data such as arrayexpress stanford microarray database smd mev bioconductor and caarray support microarray_data submissions with mage tab annotations and open_source tools are available for conversion of legacy formats into mage tab in order to improve the volume quality and granularity of annotations there is a compelling need for software that enables biologists to easily annotate such data we describe annotare a tool that facilitates annotation of gene_expression data in mage tab format annotare is available under the terms of the mit_license at http code google com p annotare to whom correspondence should be addressed annotare is a collaborative open_source software_development effort involving many institutions the tool is freely_available from annotares project web_site code google com p annotare updates and improvements are planned in response to current usability studies a web_based version of annotare is also under development not only will a web_based version be able to take advantage of finding key ontology_terms or publications via the internet but it will be configurable so that it can be directly connected to a software_package or database both arrayexpress and smd will provide access to the web_based annotare tool to construct and view high_throughput experimental annotations in addition to the web_based version of annotare future work will provide support for the mage tab version as well as rna_seq in particular annotare will be extended to allow researchers to annotate their rna_seq or chip_seq to satisfy the minseqe data_sharing requirements for high_throughput sequence_data a submitted for publication
