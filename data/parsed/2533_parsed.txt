interactive analysis of large cancer copy_number studies with copy_number explorer copy_number abnormalities cnas such as somatically acquired chromosomal deletions and duplications drive the development of cancer as individual tumor_genomes can contain tens or even hundreds of large and or focal cnas a major_difficulty is differentiating between important recurrent pathogenic changes and benign changes unrelated to the subjects phenotype here we present copy_number explorer an interactive tool for mining large copy_number datasets copy_number explorer facilitates rapid visual and statistical identification of recurrent regions of gain or loss identifies the genes most likely to drive cna formation using the cghmcr method and identifies recurrently broken genes that may be disrupted or fused the software also allows users to identify recurrent cna regions that may be associated with differential survival huge volumes of genomics data from nearly every cancer type are now freely_available and innovative projects such as ucsc cancer_genomics browser cbioportal and arraymap have begun to collate and store this information those analyzing cancer copy_number data often wish to know the location of recurrent_cnas in a given tumor_type and which genes are likely to be driving that gain or loss additionally some may wish to know which genes are recurrently broken as this can indicate a potential tumor_suppressor loss or gene_fusion it is however challenging to analyze cna regions in these ways using current gene centric or non interactive approaches this is problematic since the presence_or of a certain cna can aid in diagnosis stratify patients into different risk categories or inform therapy_decisions copy_number explorer rapidly generates and displays interactive cna and breakage frequency plots from public data such as the tcga or from the users own study the software requires only segmented copy_number data as is generated from popular segmentation_algorithms such as dnacopy subsequently it is possible to combine data from different studies or from an internal databaseeven if data were generated using different array designs or next_generation here we demonstrate the utility of copy_number explorer by applying it to the tcga glioblastoma_multiforme gbm data
