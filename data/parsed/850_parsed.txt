camur knowledge extraction from rna_seq cancer data through equivalent classification rules motivation nowadays knowledge extraction methods from next_generation data are highly requested in this work we focus on rna_seq gene_expression analysis and specifically on casecontrol_studies with rule_based supervised_classification algorithms that build a model able to discriminate cases from controls state of the art algorithms compute a single classification model that contains few features genes on the contrary our goal is to elicit a higher amount of knowledge by computing many classification_models and therefore to identify most of the genes related to the predicted class results we propose camur a new method that extracts multiple and equivalent classification_models camur iteratively computes a rule_based classification model calculates the power set of the genes present in the rules iteratively eliminates those combinations from the data_set and performs again the classification procedure until a stopping criterion is verified camur includes an ad_hoc knowledge repository database and a querying tool we analyze three different types of rna_seq data_sets breast head_and and stomach_cancer from the cancer_genome tcga and we validate camur and its models also on non tcga data our experimental_results show the efficacy of camur we obtain several reliable equivalent classification_models from which the most frequent genes their relationships and the relation with a particular cancer are deduced availability_and among next_generation experiments rna_seq gene_expression stands out as the process of quantifying the transcriptome abundance by counting the rna_fragments reads that are aligned on a reference_genome in this work we propose a new method for classifying rna_seq casecontrol samples which is able to compute multiple human_readable classification_models we call this method and its software implementation camur classifier with alternative and multiple rule_based although rna_seq tools howe v c the author published_by in this work we presented camur a new method for multiple solutions extraction in rule_based classification_problems we showed that the amount of knowledge extracted by our algorithm is higher than a standard supervised_classification we described the two parts of camur software_package mse that performs the classification procedure and msa that analyzes the obtained results additionally we designed and developed a database for an effective and comprehensive_knowledge extraction we proved the efficacy of our algorithm on large sets of rna_seq focusing on breast head_and and stomach_cancer from tcga and validating it on external data_sets from target and geo to conclude camur results as a reliable technique for solving classification_problems by extracting many alternative and equally accurate solutions in future we intend to test our method on other rna_seq data_sets in order to build a large knowledge repository of classification_models related to a particular disease the extracted genes may then be analyzed by domain_experts with functional and enrichment_analyses d it would be also interesting to perform a simulation_study for evaluating the performance of camur under different scenarios in a quantitative_manner additionally we plan to integrate in our software other rule based_classifiers as well as to enrich the software with new functions and higher performances finally we plan to extend the analysis to other biological_data as sequences classification e g dna_barcoding
