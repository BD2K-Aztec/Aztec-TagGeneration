large_scale dynamic gene_regulatory combining differential_equation models with local dynamic_bayesian analysis motivation reverse_engineering gene_regulatory especially large size networks from time_series remain a challenge to the systems_biology community in this article a new hybrid algorithm integrating ordinary_differential models with dynamic_bayesian analysis called differential_equation based local dynamic_bayesian deldbn was proposed and implemented for gene_regulatory results the performance of deldbn was benchmarked with an in vivo dataset from yeast deldbn significantly_improved the accuracy and sensitivity of network_inference compared with other approaches the local causal discovery algorithm implemented in deldbn also reduced the complexity of the network_inference algorithm and improved its scalability to infer larger_networks we have demonstrated the applicability of the approach to a network containing thousands of genes with a dataset from human hela_cell time series experiments the local network around brca was particularly investigated and validated with independent published_studies brac network was significantly_enriched with the known brca relevant interactions indicating that deldbn can effectively infer large size gene_regulatory from time series data the increasing availability of high_throughput measurements of transcripts has presented a golden opportunity for elucidating gene regulatory_pathways and networks for important traits such as human_diseases time series datasets such as the temporal measurements in yeast and human cell cycles are of particular interests for two reasons first the temporal measurements capture the expression_profile of the genes to whom correspondence should be addressed present_address school of life_science nantong university p r china in a dynamic process which allows for efficient deconvolution of the regulatory_interactions from the data second the time information of a temporal measurement provides an important extra dimension for causality studies based on the intuition that past_events has causal_effects on current and future_events and not vice_versa it is the motivation of this article to develop a systems_biology approach to reverse_engineer gene_regulatory from time series data with higher accuracy and better scalability than has been achieved using currently existing methodologies various approaches have been developed and applied for this purpose which generally fall into one of the two categories namely the modelbased approaches and the machine_learning based_approaches ordinary_differential ode_models were used in the model based_approaches to explicitly represent the dependence of the concentration of one genes transcripts on that of other genes the representative example algorithms in this category include network identification by regression nir singular_value and regression_analysis mode of action by network identification mni time series network identification tsni and inferator examples in the second category include the use of various machine_learning for network learning such as partial_correlation graphic gaussian models ggm dynamic_bayesian analysis dbn state_space model and granger_causality however the success of these approaches have been limited due to technical_challenges such as the difficulty in estimating the parameters in the ode_models and the computational_complexity for machine_learning like dbn for large size networks and lack of gold_standard datasets for the benchmarking of methodologies in this article we propose a new approach named deldbn differential_equation based local dynamic_bayesian to integrate ode_models with dynamic bayesian_analysis to infer gene_regulatory ode_models represent a parametric version of mechanistic gene regulations with the advantage of accurately capturing the underlying data generation_process to avoid the challenge of estimating parameters in solving ode_models we applied a dbn analysis step to connect the left_hand side transcription_rate of a gene to the right hand side of an ode expression_level of regulatory_genes to improve the speedupin this study we integrated for the first time a dynamic mechanistic gene_expression model with dbn analysis and demonstrated its advantage against ode based model such as tsni and dbn model in banjo when applied to fine time series dataset of irma as shown in we particularly noticed that the mutual connection between gal and gal was not able to be recovered by any of the methods discussed in the connection between these two genes is due to interactions between gal and gal proteins direct inference of these connections from transcriptional_profiles proved to be a challenge however integrating the dynamic_model i e using the time differential to infer the connections successfully uncovered these two connections inferred the connections between gal and gal too using a more complicated non parametric kinetics model with a gaussian_process approach therefore it appears that the dynamic modeling integration step empowered the subsequent dbn inference to infer the subtle connections these connections can only be inferred from their derived dynamic_properties such as the transcriptional rate in our case at the same time the approach was also able to infer other strong transcriptional regulations found by other approaches the current framework provided a way to incorporate more detailed mechanistic_understanding of transcriptional gene_regulation by modifying equation given the increasing availability of genome_scale measurements such as profiling for mrna and small_rna it becomes more and more important for network_reconstruction algorithms to have the capability to scale up to handle thousands of genes deldbn adopted the local causal discovery algorithm that was introduced by which reduced the complexity of the bayesian network_inference algorithm by reducing the number of independency tests deldbn can be applied to large size networks with thousands of genes and the computation can be finished reasonably fast order of hours as has been tested during the human hela_cell data analysis the local dbn analysis gave an approximate and faster solution to the dynamic problem as defined in equation which otherwise has to be solved in a much longer time using more complex approaches such as the gaussian_process in the current analysis we assumed the first order_markov by modeling the expression of genes g at time t g t as the a function of its regulators r at the immediate previous time point t the approach can be extended easily to allow more optional time lags with the following equation the equation can be solved using same local dbn approach to identify the mb of xi from its history predecessors however it increases the pool size of the potential_regulator by allowing more time lags although the first order approximation worked fine with irma network the actual time lag should be determined carefully based upon knowledge on the experimental system under investigation time series data allowed the inference of causal_effects relations since the direction of regulation can only go from past to current and then to the future_events different approaches such as granger_causality analysis and dbn analysis have been developed and applied to gene_regulatory analysis granger_causality analysis has been applied to the same human hela_cell data previously nagarajan and however in contrast to our study no genes were found to connect to brca in these previous two studies while in this article it has been shown that with deldbn very relevant_genes can be identified in the local neighborhood of brac therefore deldbn might have advantages for large network_analysis over other approaches another advantage of deldbn is its flexibility to incorporate_prior into the learning_process for example we can restrict the connection from transcription_factors to target_genes by only allowing predefined transcription_factors to be the regulators in the right hand side of equation we can also forbid certain connections e g a b by excluding a from the pool of potential_regulators of b in equation it should be noted that accurate dynamic profiles e g transcription_rates can only be estimated from fine time series data with short sampling time intervals the irma time series data is an excellent example of such kind with a sampling time interval of min the accurate inference of dynamic_properties is crucial to the following dbn inference of the regulatory connections thus the advantage of the algorithm cannot be necessarily guaranteed when applying to datasets with large time scales on the order of hours the result from this study also provided an example of guidance on experimental_design for gene_regulatory a time interval of tens of minutes is recommended for dynamic network_inference based on this study a few other practical limitations should be considered when applying deldbn first sampling time intervals can be quite different in many existing_studies thus a good strategy is needed to decide on whether to use transcription_rate or expression for dynamic network_inference in the current study we applied both approaches and evaluated the network quality by comparing to gold_standard datasets to make the final decision as shown in the case of irma network_inference case using transcription_rate clearly outperformed using expression data and it validates the selection of transcription_rate we also applied transcription_rate to the human hela cell_cycle data and compared brca subnetwork file in supplementary_material network brca to the one shown in section which was inferred with expression data file in supplementary_material network brca it was found that the brca network was less significantly_enriched for the abovementioned gene categories for example none of the tubulin and topoisoenzyme genes was found in brca network less number of kinesin genes was found the brca network therefore the comparison validates the selection of using expression data for network_inference in this case second data were often not sampled densely enough to estimate accurate transcription_rate moreover uneven timer intervals may be used in the sampling the current approach needs to be extended to accommodate these situations one candidate solution can be to increase the number of data_points by interpolation using smoothing spline filters with adjustable smoothing parameters as used in tsni algorithm after smoothing and interpolation discrete time series data is converted into continuous temporal data which can then be sampled evenly and densely enough to estimate the transcription_rate in silico third we estimated the transcription_rate using the backward eulers method in this article with two time points other approaches such page deldbn as forward eulers method and three point estimation can also be used these approaches need to be evaluated in different cases to find the most appropriate one for best network_inference in conclusion we have developed a new algorithm differential_equation integrated local dynamic_bayesian analysis deldbn for inference of large gene_regulatory from time series data by benchmarking on two experimental_datasets irma and human hela cell_cycle time series data deldbn demonstrated significant improvements over other approaches such as dbn and granger_causality analysis on reconstructing networks of both small and large sizes
