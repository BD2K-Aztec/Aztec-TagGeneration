samfire multi_locus variant_calling for time resolved sequence_data an increasingly common method for studying evolution is the collection of time resolved short_read such datasets allow for the direct_observation of rapid evolutionary_processes as might occur in natural microbial_populations and in evolutionary experiments in many circumstances evolutionary_pressure acting upon single variants can cause gen_omic changes at multiple nearby loci samfire is an open_access software_package for processing and analyzing sequence_reads from time resolved data calling important single and multi_locus variants over time identifying alleles potentially affected by selection calculating linkage disequi librium statistics performing haplotype reconstruction and exploiting time resolved information to estimate the extent of uncertainty in reported genomic_data availability_and c code may be found at https github com time resolved genome sequence_data provides direct information about evolutionary_processes at low recombination_rates populations evolve via clonal competition whereby linkage effects spanning multiple_loci determine the outcome of adaptation the samfire software extracts and processes multi_locus information from time resolved genomic_data so as to shed light on underlying patterns of evolution samfire includes a sequence processing pipeline filter that performs quality_control on short_read in aligned sam format similar to a previous approach to variant_calling individual_reads are filtered by median base_quality trimming sequence in order to achieve this subject to a minimum read_length individual nucleotides that fall below a given quality threshold are then removed being replaced by blank alleles to indicate a lack of available information duplicate_reads may be removed before paired_end are joined any interval between paired_reads being spanned by blank alleles the pipeline sl traj then callswhere multi_locus models of selection are evaluated the reduction of the model space to a smaller number of loci can improve computational_efficiency having identified single locus polymorphisms the pipeline call ml identifies multi allele variants spanning these loci sets of loci that could be spanned by paired_end are efficiently found multilocus variants are filtered by the minimum number of observations of a variant and variant frequency then reported across all time points optionally within this pipeline full haplotypes may be reconstructed from the multi_locus reads via a rule_based procedure see supporting_information while other approaches to haplotype reconstruction have used model_selection to infer a minimum number of haplotypes required to explain a dataset we here adopt a maximal approach constructing a set of haplotypes that are guaranteed to explain all of the filtered multi_locus sequence observations without further error the pipeline ml noise infers the extent of noise in the observed multi_locus sequence_data again optimizing a dirichlet multinomial likelihood_function time resolved data has elsewhere been used to infer haplotype_frequencies under a dynamic_model of adaptation given variants spanning both multiple and single loci the pipeline ld calc calculates estimates of linkage_disequilibrium between loci shows an example of data generated by applying samfire to within host data from time resolved sampling of hiv in a single patient here showing the expansion of viral diversity over time as expressed in one set of locus partial haplotypes the code is highly_flexible allowing for multiple user choices in evaluating data with the increase in the collection of genomic_data we hope that samfire will be of value to researchers aiming to build a greater understanding of rapid evolutionary_processes
