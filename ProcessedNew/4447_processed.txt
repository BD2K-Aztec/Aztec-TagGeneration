structural genomics of histone tail recognition the structural genomics of histone tail recognition web server is an open access resource that presents within mini articles all publicly available experimental structures of histone tails in complex with human proteins. each article is composed of interactive 3d slides that dissect the structural mechanism underlying the recognition of specific sequences and histone marks. a concise text html-linked to interactive graphics guides the reader through the main features of the interaction. this resource can be used to analyze and compare binding modes across multiple histone recognition modules, to evaluate the chemical tractability of binding sites involved in epigenetic signaling and design small molecule inhibitors.post-translational modifications of histone proteins regulate chromatin compaction, mediate epigenetic regulation of transcription and control cellular differentiation in health and disease . a variety of epigenetic marks are deposited, removed and sensed individually and in combinations by so-called writers, erasers and readers of the histone code . most posttranslational modifications occur at lysine residues on the n-terminal unstructured portion of histones. the structural mechanisms underlying specific recognition of histone tail sequences and post-translational modifications are central to the emerging concept of chromatin as a complex signaling platform where diverse epigenetic marks can make or break circuits in a synergistic or antagonistic manner . additionally, the binding mode of individual histone tail side chains to catalyticpage: 2630 26292630
