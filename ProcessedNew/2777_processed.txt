gene expression magic: access portal to a cross-platform gene expression compendium for maize to facilitate the exploration of publicly available zea mays expression data, we constructed a maize expression compendium, making use of an integration methodology and a consistent probe to gene mapping based on the 5b.60 sequence release of z. mays. the compendium is made available through a web portal magic that hosts a variety of analysis tools to easily browse and analyze the data. our compendium is different from previous initiatives in combining expression values across different experiments by providing a consistent gene annotation across different platforms.owing to its importance as sustainable food and feedstock, maize genomics is of high academic and industrial relevance. as a result, microarrays have been widely applied to interrogate the maize transcriptome, with currently4100 maize gene expression experiments being publicly available in online repositories such as geo and arrayexpress . however, cross-platform differences, the lack of consistent platform and measurement descriptions and inconsistent gene annotations in maize complicated the straightforward use of these data. to integrate the data from different array platforms in a readily usable single compendium, we resolved gene annotation inconsistencies by reannotating probes of previously published zea mays arrays using the published maize genome sequence and made measurements comparable across different platforms/experiments using an adapted version of the data integration method described by. this resulted in a cross-platform expression compendium containing 1749 microarrays covering 24 690 genes. additional gene information was integrated from various external sources. experimental annotations were manually curated. a web access portal magic with a specialized set of exploration and analysis functionalities provides public access to this compendium.
