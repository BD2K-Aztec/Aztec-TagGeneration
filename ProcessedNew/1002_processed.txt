sequence analysis climat: accurate detection of copy number alteration and loss of heterozygosity in impure and aneuploid tumor samples using whole-genome sequencing data motivation: whole-genome sequencing of tumor samples has been demonstrated as an efficient approach for comprehensive analysis of genomic aberrations in cancer genome. critical issues such as tumor impurity and aneuploidy, gc-content and mappability bias have been reported to complicate identification of copy number alteration and loss of heterozygosity in complex tumor samples. therefore, efficient computational methods are required to address these issues. results: we introduce climat (cna and loh assessment in impure and aneuploid tumors), a bioinformatics tool for identification of genomic aberrations from tumor samples using whole-genome sequencing data. without requiring a matched normal sample, climat takes integrated analysis of read depth and allelic frequency and provides extensive data processing procedures including gc-content and mappability correction of read depth and quantile normalization of b-allele frequency. climat accurately identifies copy number alteration and loss of heterozygosity even for highly impure tumor samples with aneuploidy. we evaluate climat on both simulated and real dna sequencing data to demonstrate its ability to infer tumor impurity and ploidy and identify genomic aberrations in complex tumor samples. availability and implementation: the climat software package can be freely downloaded atvarious aberrations such as amplification, deletion and translocation of segmental regions are common features of cancer genomes and play an important role in tumorigenesis and progression . it is reported that dysfunction of oncogene and tumor suppressor gene is related to frequent genomic aberrations . genomic aberrations in specific regions have been used as an indicator of aggressiveness of cancer and clinical outcome . genome-wide copy number alteration (cna) and loss of heterozygosity (loh) are two essential features of cancer genomes, and accurate detection of these abnormalities is a crucial step to assess genomic aberrations and cancer-related genes. experimental technologies are now available for high-throughput profiling of genome-wide aberrations in tumor samples, such as array comparative genomic hybridization , single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) genotyping array and more recently, whole-genome sequencing (wgs) technology for massively parallel sequencing of dna . by allowing for comprehensive analysis of genomic aberrations in cancer genomes, wgs has been demonstrated as an efficient platform for studies of human cancers . although several computational approaches have been proposed for assessing genomic aberrations from tumor sequencing data , most of these methods do not effectively address the critical issues encountered in interpreting complex tumor samples. for example, tumor samples are often infiltrated with normal stroma, resulting in inevitable contamination of normal dna and dilution of somatic aberration signals . impurity of tumor sample can significantly alter wgs data; and therefore, complicates genomic aberration detection, especially when normal cells dominate in tumor samples. recent studies, such as freec and apolloh , have been proposed to address this issue. freec constructs copy number and b-allele frequency (baf) profiles to detect cna and allelic content in cancer genomes, with optional correction for tumor impurity. apolloh is designed for loh detection using tumor-normal paired samples, and the issue of tumor impurity is addressed by a two-component mixture model for allelic read counts. in addition to tumor impurity, tumor aneuploidy is another critical issue in genomic aberration detection, which is caused by various numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities frequently observed in cancer genome . although apolloh introduces a delicate statistical model to eliminate the effect of tumor impurity, it does not take account of tumor aneuploidy in modeling and analyzing tumor wgs data. to handle aneuploid tumor samples, freec provides to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution non-commercial license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/ by-nc/3.0/), which permits non-commercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. for commercial re-use, please contact journals.permissions@oup.com an option for users to input tumor ploidy. currently, automatic correction for tumor aneuploidy using wgs data still remains a challenging task. theoretically, it is often difficult to determine the actual ploidy of cancer cells by sequencing technology . in some particular cases, somatic aberration signals could present similar characteristics among genomes of different ploidy , which makes it hard to accurately estimate the tumor ploidy. it should be pointed out that, complicated interpretation of wgs data are even more challenging in tumor samples confounded by both tumor impurity and aneuploidy, as they usually cannot be solved separately . so far, only a few algorithms have been proposed for analyzing wgs data of impure tumor samples with aneuploidy . for example, cnanorm uses a mixture normal distribution for ratios of tumor-normal read counts to correct tumor impurity and aneuploidy. however, cnanorm assumes that the most common component in the normal mixture is diploid, which may not hold for aneuploid tumor samples. moreover, it cannot detect loh in cancer genomes. another approach, absolute , is originally introduced to detect cna from snp array data by inferring tumor impurity and ploidy. although it can be adapted to analyze dna sequencing data, a previous study shows that the underlying statistical models used by absolute do not comprehensively describe the characteristics of dna sequencing data and therefore may sometimes gravely misestimate the tumor impurity and ploidy . recently, markus et al. introduced a novel method called patchwork for allele-specific copy number analysis of sequenced tumor tissue in consideration of tumor impurity and tumor aneuploidy, which requires intermediate arguments determined by users. in addition, it is noteworthy that another method called theta was proposed recently to analyze tumor sequencing data . theta mainly focuses on the inference of cancer subclones in heterogeneous tumor samples and cannot detect loh in cancer genomes, as it only utilizes read count data. therefore, it is essential to develop an efficient approach for analysis of tumor sequencing data by comprehensively addressing the challenge of tumor impurity and aneuploidy. in this study, we present a novel method called climat (cna and loh assessment in impure and aneuploid tumors) to detect genomic aberrations with automatic correction for both tumor impurity and aneuploidy. without requiring a matched normal sample, climat fully explores both read depth (rd) and allele frequency derived from tumor wgs data, and provides extensive data processing procedures including elimination of sequencing/mapping bias and quantile normalization (qn) of allele frequency data. by adopting an integrated hidden markov model (hmm) that quantitatively delineates tumor impurity and ploidy, climat provides accurate identification of various kinds of genomic aberrations even for highly impure tumor samples with aneuploidy. we apply climat to both simulated and real tumor data, and the results demonstrate the superior performance of climat in analysis of genomic aberrations using tumor wgs data.
