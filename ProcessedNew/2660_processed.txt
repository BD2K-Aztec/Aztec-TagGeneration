lamplink: detection of statistically significant snp combinations from gwas data one of the major issues in genome-wide association studies is to solve the missing her-itability problem. while considering epistatic interactions among multiple snps may contribute to solving this problem, existing software cannot detect statistically significant high-order interactions. we propose software named lamplink, which employs a cutting-edge method to enumerate statistically significant snp combinations from genome-wide casecontrol data. lamplink is implemented as a set of additional functions to plink, and hence existing procedures with plink can be applicable. applied to the 1000 genomes project data, lamplink detected a combination of five snps that are statistically significantly accumulated in the japanese population. availability and implementation: lamplink is available at http://a-terada.github.io/lamplink/.
