consensusclusterplus: a class discovery tool with confidence assessments and item tracking unsupervised class discovery is a highly useful technique in cancer research, where intrinsic groups sharing biological characteristics may exist but are unknown. the consensus clustering (cc) method provides quantitative and visual stability evidence for estimating the number of unsupervised classes in a dataset. consensusclusterplus implements the cc method in r and extends it with new functionality and visualizations including item tracking, item-consensus and cluster-consensus plots. these new features provide users with detailed information that enable more specific decisions in unsupervised class discovery. availability: consensusclusterplus is open source software, written in r, under gpl-2, and available through the bioconductor projectunsupervised class discovery is a data mining technique for the detection of unknown possible groups of items based on intrinsic features and no external information. for this technique, an investigator seeks to answer two questions: how many groups are present in a dataset, and what is the confidence in the number of groups and the group memberships. consensus clustering (cc) is a method for evaluating these questions and is popular in cancer research [e.g. lung adenocarcinoma (. cc provides quantitative and visual stability evidence derived from repeated subsampling and clustering. cc reports a consensus of these repetitions, which is robust relative to sampling variability. the cc method is available in the genepattern software . consensusclusterplus implements the cc method in the r language (http://www.r-project.org) and adds new functionality and visualizations.
