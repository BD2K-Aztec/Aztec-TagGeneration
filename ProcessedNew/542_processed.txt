a statistical approach for inferring the 3d structure of the genome motivation: recent technological advances allow the measurement, in a single hi-c experiment, of the frequencies of physical contacts among pairs of genomic loci at a genome-wide scale. the next challenge is to infer, from the resulting dnadna contact maps, accurate 3d models of how chromosomes fold and fit into the nucleus. many existing inference methods rely on multidimensional scaling (mds), in which the pairwise distances of the inferred model are optimized to resemble pairwise distances derived directly from the contact counts. these approaches, however, often optimize a heuristic objective function and require strong assumptions about the biophysics of dna to transform interaction frequencies to spatial distance, and thereby may lead to incorrect structure reconstruction. methods: we propose a novel approach to infer a consensus 3d structure of a genome from hi-c data. the method incorporates a statistical model of the contact counts, assuming that the counts between two loci follow a poisson distribution whose intensity decreases with the physical distances between the loci. the method can automatically adjust the transfer function relating the spatial distance to the poisson intensity and infer a genome structure that best explains the observed data. results: we compare two variants of our poisson method, with or without optimization of the transfer function, to four different mds-based algorithmstwo metric mds methods using different stress functions, a non-metric version of mds and chromsde, a recently described, advanced mds methodon a wide range of simulated datasets. we demonstrate that the poisson models reconstruct better structures than all mds-based methods, particularly at low coverage and high resolution, and we highlight the importance of optimizing the transfer function. on publicly available hi-c data from mouse embryonic stem cells, we show that the poisson methods lead to more reproducible structures than mds-based methods when we use data generated using different restriction enzymes, and when we reconstruct structures at different resolutions. availability and implementation: a python implementation of the proposed method is available atspatial and temporal 3d genome architecture is thought to play an important role in many genomic functions, but is still poorly understood (van). in recent years, the technique of chromosome conformation capture (3c;), which identifies physical contacts between different genomic loci and yields information about their relative spatial distance in the nucleus, has paved the way for the systematic analysis of the 3d structure of dna. coupled with highthroughput sequencing, genome-wide conformation capture assays, broadly referred to as hi-c , have emerged as promising techniques to investigate the global structure of dna at various resolutions. hi-c has opened new avenues to understanding many biological processes including gene regulation, dna replication, somatic copy number alterations and epigenetic changes . a typical hi-c experiment yields a dna contact map, that is, a matrix indicating the frequency of interactions between all pairs of loci at a given resolution. a fundamental question is then to reconstruct the 3d structure of the genome from this contact map. two general approaches have been proposed for that purpose: (i) consensus methods that aim at inferring a unique mean structure representative of the data and (ii) ensemble methods that yield a population of structures. consensus approaches model each chromosome by a chain of beads, convert the contact map frequencies into pairwise distances (which we refer as wish distances) using various biophysical models of dna and infer a 3d conformation that best matches the pairwise distances by solving a multidimensional scaling (mds) problem . converting interaction counts to physical wish distances requires, however, strong assumptions that are not always met in practice. for example, this mapping may change from one organism to another , from one resolution to another , from one genomic distance range to another or from one time point to another during the cell cycle . to alleviate this problem,proposed chromsde, a method that jointly optimizes the 3d structure and a parameter of the function that maps contact frequencies to spatial distances, in addition to modifying the objective function of mds.proposed an approach akin to non-metric mds (nmds;), where the 3d structure and the wish distances are alternatingly optimized in an attempt to preserve coherence between the ranking of pairwise distances and the ranking of pairwise contact frequencies. as for the ensemble methods,describe two formal probabilistic models of contact frequencies and their relationship with physical distances. they then use a markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) sampling procedure to produce an ensemble of 3d structures consistent with the observed contact counts.propose an optimization framework that generates a population of structures by enforcing each contact to define an active constraint in only a fraction of the inferred structures, thereby mimicking to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this is an open

each cell in the hi-c sample. applying a similar method to budding yeast,demonstrate that a large population of structures inferred using known physical constraints of yeast genome architecture can recapitulate, to a large extent, the consensus contact map observed from hi-c experiments. both consensus and ensemble models have benefits and limitations. ensemble approaches are biologically more accurate because hi-c data are derived from a population of cells, each with potentially a unique 3d architecture. an inferred population of 3d structures may therefore better reflect the diversity of structures than a single consensus structure. in concordance with such ensemble methods, a recent development in hi-c technology, assaying chromatin conformation at a single cell level, demonstrates that chromatin structure varies highly from cell to cell by modeling the single-copy x chromosomes of a male mouse cell line . however, an ensemble approach raises the question of interpretability: one often has to fall back to interpreting a mean signal from the population structure or to selecting a few structures, representative in some way of the diversity of the population . consensus methods, in contrast, provide a single structure more amenable to visual inspection and analysis. this structure can be seen as a useful model to recapitulate the rich information captured in hi-c data and to allow easy integration with other sources of data, such as rna-seq, which are usually also population based. in addition, despite the stochasticity of cell-to-cell variations, certain hallmarks of genome organization observed by consensus methods, such as chromosome territories or topological domain organization, are conserved across different cells . computationally, ensemble methods are more demanding than consensus methods because they need to sample from a large dimensional space of possible structures with complicated likelihood landscapes. optimization-based consensus methods are usually faster to converge to a local optimum, but may miss the global optimum corresponding to the best structure when the objective function is non-convex. in this work, we focus on the consensus approach, and we propose a new method to infer a 3d structure from hi-c data. we propose to replace the arbitrary loss function minimized by existing mds-based approaches by a better-motivated likelihood function derived from a statistical model, similar to the one used by a previous ensemble method . specifically, our proposed method models the interaction frequency between two loci by a poisson model (pm), the intensity of which decreases with the increasing spatial distance between the pair of loci. similar to the problem of inferring the wish distances from interaction frequencies faced by mds-based approaches, our model faces the difficulty of transforming spatial distances into intensities of the poisson distribution. to solve this problem, we propose two variant methods. the first method (pm1) uses a default transfer function motivated by a biophysical model, whereas the second method (pm2) uses a parametric family of transfer functions, the parameters of which are automatically optimized together with the 3d structure to best explain the observed data. we compare both pm variants to four mds-based methods, including metric mds with two stress functions, nmds and chromsde. we demonstrate on simulated data that the new models reconstruct more accurate 3d structures than all mdsbased methods, especially at low coverage and high resolution. we also assess the negative effect of using an incorrect transfer function, and we show that pm2 is able to overcome this difficulty. on real data, we show that, compared with mds-based methods, pm1 and pm2 generate more similar models when applied to replicate experiments performed with different restriction enzymes or when applied to the same data at varying resolutions. the results suggest that the pm methods we describe here provide promising alternatives to current methods for consensus dna structure inference.to assess the relative strength of our new pm-based methods, pm1 and pm2, we compare them to a panel of four mds-based methods: mds1, mds2, nmds and chromsde on simulated and real data.
