estimation of pairwise sequence similarity of mammalian enhancers with word neighbourhood counts motivation: the identity of cells and tissues is to a large degree governed by transcriptional regulation. a major part is accomplished by the combinatorial binding of transcription factors at regulatory sequences, such as enhancers. even though binding of transcription factors is sequence-specific, estimating the sequence similarity of two functionally similar enhancers is very difficult. however, a similarity measure for regulatory sequences is crucial to detect and understand functional similarities between two enhancers and will facilitate large-scale analyses like clustering, prediction and classification of genome-wide datasets. results: we present the standardized alignment-free sequence similarity measure n2, a flexible framework that is defined for word neighbourhoods. we explore the usefulness of adding reverse complement words as well as words including mismatches into the neighbourhood. on simulated enhancer sequences as well as functional enhancers in mouse development, n2 is shown to outperform previous alignment-free measures. n2 is flexible, faster than competing methods and less susceptible to single sequence noise and the occurrence of repetitive sequences. experiments on the mouse enhancers reveal that enhancers active in different tissues can be separated by pairwise comparison using n2. conclusion: n2 represents an improvement over previous alignment-free similarity measures without compromising speed, which makes it a good candidate for large-scale sequence comparison of regulatory sequences. availability: the software is part of the open-source c++ library seqan (www.seqan.de) and a compiled version can be downloaded at http://www.seqan.de/projects/alf.html contact:mammalian organisms consist of several hundred different cell types. every cell has the same repertoire of genes; however, only a subset will be expressed to enable cell type-specific phenotypes. many different factors regulate gene expression, of which genetically encoded transcriptional regulation seems to whom correspondence should be addressed. to play the major part . sequence-dependent gene regulation is mainly achieved through the binding of transcription factors at short dna motifs. these transcription factor binding sites often occur in regulatory clusters in the genome, called cis-regulatory modules (crms). some crms can repress transcription, whereas others, referred to as enhancers, can enhance gene expression. studies in drosophila showed that the combination of binding sites together with the set of transcription factors actively recruited to a crm determines its cell type specificity . more generally speaking, regulatory sequences with a similar binding site content can be expected to drive similar expression patterns. this is analogous to coding sequences, where sequence similarity has been used for many years to estimate functional similarity. the pairwise similarity of coding sequences is usually computed using global or local alignments. this approach works well for sequences which are at least partially alignable; however, this is not the case for nonhomologous crms. the location and orientation of binding sites in crms that show similar cell type-specific activity may differ widely, making it impossible to produce alignments. alignment-free methods compare sequences according to their word content, see for an overview. the initial purpose was to design a fast and accurate measure of pairwise (dis-)similarity that could be used in databases where traditional alignments were too slow . in the meantime, alignment-free methods have been applied in other contexts such as phylogeny and motif finding . the idea to describe a sequence by its word content directly fits the model of crms, where we assume that a similar function is reflected in a similar binding site content. word count-based methods have been used to compare regulatory sequences . however, these methods calculate the similarity of sequences based on exact word counts, whereas transcription factor binding sites are generally more flexible patterns. furthermore, the genomic orientation of crms and of the binding sites within is most often unknown, highlighting the need to compare sequences according to the word counts on both strands simultaneously. as an example, the word w = cataat might be bound by the same transcription factor as the words cttaat and attatg, the former having one substitution, the latter being on the reverse strand. exact word comparison methods consider these words dissimilar. more generally, let n(w) bein this study, we showed that n2 improves alignment-free sequence comparison through its flexible extension to word neighbourhood counts, thereby covering approximate and orientation-independent word matches. previously, the d2z score has been extended to allow for approximate matching words using estimates for the expectations and the variances based on a bernoulli background model; however, no implementation is available . the framework that we present here is much more general and powerful. we allow for any desired word neighbourhood and associate words with weights such that the signal of words matching exactly is not lost. furthermore, n2 can be computed on any background model order, which is essential to properly describe genomic sequences. finally, n2 is much faster than d2z even without approximate matching, suggesting that a z-score calculation for an approximate d2 score would be infeasible for any dataset of realistic size. page: 662 656663the differences between n2 as used in this study and d2 are mainly due to the estimation of the background model. the better performance of d2 suggests that the concatenation of the sequences improves the accuracy of the background model; however, it drastically increases the running time. here we observe that the improvement due to the extension to the word neighbourhood (n2 versus n2 mm,rc ) is better than the improvement due to different background model estimates (n2 versus d2 ,). with simulation studies we showed that n2 performs well on the task it was designed for, namely finding similarities between sequences based on shared words. importantly, n2 is also able to measure similarity of in vivo identified enhancer sequences. this allows us to verify and increase our understanding of the architecture of regulatory elements: word count-based similarity measures are able to detect tissue-specific activity of enhancers, suggesting that crms contain scattered binding sites that contribute to their tissue specificity. extending the word neighbourhood to the reverse complement (n2 rc ) improves the performance, showing that binding sites can occur on both strands of the crm. extending the neighbourhood to words with one mismatch (n2 rc,mm ) further improves the performance on experimentally identified enhancers. this suggests that there are subtle signals like a common content of similar but not equal words which are characteristic of genomic enhancers.in this study, we have presented n2, a novel alignment-free measure of sequence similarity that overcomes the limitations imposed by traditional exact word count-based methods. we have included the general concept of weighted word neighbourhood counts and shown that it improves the ability to detect similarity between regulatory sequences. the task of pairwise comparison of regulatory sequences is much harder than traditional pairwise alignment since only very few shared words might lead to a similar activity. we have demonstrated on a large-scale dataset of mammalian enhancer sequences that pairwise sequence similarity of non-homologous regulatory sequences is able to estimate similar in vivo activity. we
