genome analysis multi-factor data normalization enables the detection of copy number aberrations in amplicon sequencing data motivation: because of its low cost, amplicon sequencing, also known as ultra-deep targeted sequencing, is now becoming widely used in oncology for detection of actionable mutations, i.e. mutations influencing cell sensitivity to targeted therapies. amplicon sequencing is based on the polymerase chain reaction amplification of the regions of interest, a process that considerably distorts the information on copy numbers initially present in the tumor dna. therefore, additional experiments such as single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) or comparative genomic hybridization (cgh) arrays often complement ampli-con sequencing in clinics to identify copy number status of genes whose amplification or deletion has direct consequences on the efficacy of a particular cancer treatment. so far, there has been no proven method to extract the information on gene copy number aberrations based solely on amplicon sequencing. results: here we present oncocnv, a method that includes a multi-factor normalization and annotation technique enabling the detection of large copy number changes from amplicon sequencing data. we validated our approach on high and low amplicon density datasets and demonstrated that oncocnv can achieve a precision comparable with that of array cgh techniques in detecting copy number aberrations. thus, oncocnv applied on amplicon sequencing data would make the use of additional array cgh or snp array experiments unnecessary. availability and implementation:the emergence of the amplicon sequencing technique, which followed whole-exome sequencing (wes), promises a revolution in cancer diagnostics and treatment. amplicon sequencing consists of the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of a limited number of the genomic regions of interest (amplicons) followed by high-throughput sequencing (supplementary) . each amplicon often coincides with an exon; exons longer than the typical length of pcr reaction products may be covered by two or more amplicons (supplementary). although relatively expensive exome sequencing consists of indepth sequencing of nearly all the coding exons, the amplicon sequencing technique aims at sequencing a limited number of genes (from several dozen to several thousand exons) at an extremely low cost. the genes included in a panel of amplicon sequencing (actionable genes) are genes that are often altered in different cancer types, and for whose alterations targeted therapies have been established or are in clinical development. for instance, the targetrich tm crx kit from kailos genetics assays such cancer-related genes as braf, egfr, flt3, jak2, kit, kras, pik3ca, pten, tp53 and vegfa; the ampliseq tm cancer panel from life technologies targets 190 regions of interest in 46 well-characterized oncogenes and tumor suppressors. some actionable genes often undergo point mutation or exon deletions (e.g. alk, braf), whereas others undergo amplification in copy number (e.g. mycn, erbb2) . because of the exceedingly high read coverage of amplicon sequencing data, there is no methodological issue in the identification of point mutations and small insertions or deletions (indels). however, how to reliably detect copy number changes, in particular gene deletions and amplifications, in amplicon sequencing data is still open to discussion. here, we focus on the identification of copy number alterations (cnas) also known as large copy number changes (cnvs) of the actionable genes targeted by amplicon sequencing. although there are several algorithms to detect cnas in exome sequencing data , it is questionable as to whether the same approaches can be efficient when applied to amplicon sequencing data. first, to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the

normalization can be less effective on amplicon sequencing data. second, because of the different protocols used for library preparation, amplicon sequencing data can have various biases. importantly, while for exome sequencing experiments an effort has been made to uniform exon coverage, amplicon sequencing technology emphasizes extremely high depth of coverage with less regard to coverage homogeneity. here we provide a solution to the challenging question of extracting cnas from amplicon sequencing data by (i) defining a method to normalize read coverage with a small set of normal control samples and (ii) assigning statistical significance to putative cnas resulting from the segmentation of normalized profiles. we validated the proposed method on (a) a high amplicon density dataset of eight tumor samples for which array comparative genomic hybridization (array cgh) profiles were available, (b) a high amplicon density dataset of 30 erbb2-positive ovarian cancer samples and (c) a low amplicon density dataset of 30 tumors, coupled with single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) array data. we show that the results obtained from the oncocnv method compare favorably with the results obtained from adtex and nextgene (http://www.softgenetics.com/nextgene_013. html), which are respectively public-domain and commercial software designed to detect cnvs in whole exome sequencing data.we proposed a method to analyze amplicon sequencing data to be used to detect cnas involving at least several exons. our method, oncocnv, demonstrated a high accuracy of cna predictions for the samples for which we had the results of array cgh analysis as gold standard. oncocnv significantly outperformed methods developed for exome sequencing data analysis. this is because of the extensive normalization strategy, which includes normalization for the gc content, amplicon length (via loess correction) and other technology-specific biases (via pca of the control samples). an important advantage of oncocnv is the refinement of breakpoints falling initially within a gene (i.e. after the segmentation of nrc profiles). oncocnv reanalyzes the nrcs upstream and downstream of the putative breakpoint and decides whether intragenic breakpoint has indeed taken place and that it is not the result of inaccurate segmentation (supplementary). in our dataset, we observed samples (e.g. controls 3 and 9, supplementary) where a large fraction of amplicons (26 for both) have zero or extremely low rcs. we would like to point out that oncocnv is able to detect such artifacts and analyze cnas correctly in the corresponding samples. the prediction of gains and losses by oncocnv includes information on average log nrc. in addition, it estimates possible copy numbers. this estimate is based on the assumption that the tumor sample genome is diploid and that the sample is not contaminated by normal cells. we are aware that this assumption might be far from being true. however, we prefer to provide an estimate of the probable copy number to allow the user to distinguish between gains and amplifications, and between one and two allele losses. the question of predicting the exact copy number cannot be solved by using copy number profiles alone. the assessment of b allele frequencies provides a possible solution . we did not use this solution in oncocnv because of the high dispersion of b allele frequencies in the amplicon sequencing data (data not shown). cnas detected by oncocnv (and by other software whose algorithm is based only on the analysis of copy number profile) are relative to the evaluated zero level. for instance, if we measure the copy numbers of only a pair of genes, we will not be able to see a gain or loss if this happens simultaneously in both genes. thus, to properly estimate the zero level, many genes should be included in the targeted gene panel. as we expected, we detected a fall in the cna detection accuracy for samples that were highly contaminated by normal cells. in this situation, the noise in measurements is comparable with the expected difference between measurements in the case of one copy gain or loss. as our approach does not use information about b allele frequencies, certain combinations of normal contamination and tumor ploidy significantly impair the efficiency of the technique. this is especially true when there are a small number of measurements (amplicons) per gene. we would like to point out that oncocnv does not detect one-amplicon amplifications/deletions. we believe the noise in current amplicon-based technologies does not allow detection of such cnvs with high certainty. however, there are methods, such as contra , which predict the cnvs of single amplicon regions. we do not position oncocnv as a tool for exome sequencing data analysis. unlike many exome sequencing data analysis tools, oncocnv does not take into account b allele frequencies. because of this limitation, oncocnv is not able to evaluate the level of the contamination by normal cells or improve the accuracy of cna calling by simultaneously processing copy number and b allele frequency profiles . our analysis of biases intrinsic to amplicon sequencing revealed two factors influencing the rcs: amplicon length and gc content. as loess correction is possible only for the amplicon sizes frequently present in the dataset (from 70 to 140 bp in our case), we advise using as narrow a range of amplicon lengths as possible in the future design of amplicon regions. similarly, for the gc-content normalization, the cna prediction may be inaccurate for amplicons with extremely high or low gc content. this is especially true in the case when all amplicon regions within a gene (usually overlapping with exons) have an extremely high or low gc content. for such genes, we advise designing additional amplicons in the intronic regions with moderate gc content if it is planned to completely bypass array cgh or a similar technique to predict the copy number status of the targeted regions.
