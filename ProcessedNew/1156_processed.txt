contrastrank: a new method for ranking putative cancer driver genes and classification of tumor samples motivation: the recent advance in high-throughput sequencing technologies is generating a huge amount of data that are becoming an important resource for deciphering the genotype underlying a given phenotype. genome sequencing has been extensively applied to the study of the cancer genomes. although a few methods have been already proposed for the detection of cancer-related genes, their automatic identification is still a challenging task. using the genomic data made available by the cancer genome atlas consortium (tcga), we propose a new prioritization approach based on the analysis of the distribution of putative deleterious variants in a large cohort of cancer samples. results: in this paper, we present contastrank, a new method for the prioritization of putative impaired genes in cancer. the method is based on the comparison of the putative defective rate of each gene in tumor versus normal and 1000 genome samples. we show that the method is able to provide a ranked list of putative impaired genes for colon, lung and prostate adenocarcinomas. the list significantly overlaps with the list of known cancer driver genes previously published. more importantly, by using our scoring approach, we can successfully discriminate between tcga normal and tumor samples. a binary classifier based on contrastrank score reaches an overall accuracy 490 and the area under the curve (auc) of receiver operating characteristics (roc) 40.95 for all the three types of adenocar-cinoma analyzed in this paper. in addition, using contrastrank score, we are able to discriminate the three tumor types with a minimum overall accuracy of 77 and auc of 0.83. conclusions: we describe contrastrank, a method for prioritizing putative impaired genes in cancer. the method is based on the comparison of exome sequencing data from different cohorts and can detect putative cancer driver genes. contrastrank can also be used to estimate a global score for an individual genome about the risk of adenocarcinoma based on the genetic variants information from a whole-exome vcf (variant calling format) file. we believe that the application of contrastrank can be an important step in genomic medicine to enable genome-based diagnosis. availability and implementation: the lists of contrastrank scores of all genes in each tumor type are available as supplementary materials. a webserver for evaluating the risk of the three studied adenocarcin-omas starting from whole-exome vcf file is under development.in the past few years, next-generation sequencing (ngs)-based screening has become an important tool for the detection of genetic variants associated with many genetic disorders . its application on the study of cancer genomes allowed the discovery of several cancer-related genes . the cancer genome atlas (tcga) consortium (cancer genome atlas research) is producing a huge amount of cancer genome sequencing data for 430 cancer types. this enables the detection of an increasing number of variants potentially involved in cancer . however, the interpretation of genetic variants is a challenging problem , and it is difficult to differentiate variation in specific genes responsible for the development and progression of cancer (drivers) from the background (passengers). in general, the prediction of cancer driver mutations is based on the conservation analysis of mutated sites . the accurate detection of driver mutations is important to define cancer driver genes that play a causative role in oncogenesis through exerting a selective advantage to the cancer cells. so far, several methods for identifying cancer driver genes have been reported . the prevalent strategy to identify cancer driver genes works by detecting significantly over-mutated genes in tumors, which are more likely the drivers . most of the methods compare the frequency of mutations in an individual gene with the mutation frequency of other genes in the same or related tumors after correction for sequence context and gene size . using this approach, a considerable number of driver genes have been discovered in a variety of cancer types. however, many seemingly unrelated genes have also been identified in recent cancer genome sequencing studies . the heterogeneity of mutational processes within individuals and cancer types could explain this anomaly . therefore, there is a pressing need for robust methods to identify cancer driver genes . we describe here a new probabilistic approach (contrastrank) to identify putative cancer driver genes based on the estimation of the variation rates of genes in 1000 to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution non-commercial license

different tumor types. we tested the method on three whole-exome sequencing data of adenocarcinomas from tcga. our method performs highly in discriminating normal from tumor samples, as well as, different types of adenocarcinomas.in this paper, we describe contrastrank, a method that relies on the analysis of pigs in the tcga normal and cancer samples for prioritizing potential cancer driver genes. for each gene in each cancer type (coad, luad and prad), we calculated probabilistic scores that allow us to discriminate tcga normal from tumor samples. in the following sections, we described the results of our analysis of three tcga adenocarcinoma datasets and the performance of contrastrank algorithm on each tumor type.accurate variant calling and appropriate filtering procedures are important prerequisites for the analysis of whole-exome sequencing data. although alternative variant calling procedures can result in different number of variants, the consistency of our datasets composition (supplementary), in terms of total snvs, pdvs and pigs, makes us confident about the average quality of nssnvs used in our analysis. this is also confirmed by similar distributions of pdvs and nssnvs in each sample (supplementary). the general idea of using rare nssnvs is supported by the analysis of variants annotated in dbsnp (supplementary) furthermore, the selection of 0.5 as a threshold for defining pdvs is consistent with previously large-scale analysis of human genetic variants . the analysis of selected pdvs and the distribution of pdrs for pigs in each dataset (1000 genomes, tcga normal and tumor samples) shows an increasing percentage of pigs with pdr40.05 from 1000 genomes to tcga tumor samples (supplementary). on average, for the three tumor types (coad, luad and prad), the number of pigs with pdrs40.05 are 4.5, 9.5 and 17.7 in 1000 genomes, tcga normal and tumor samples, respectively. this observation is in agreement with the idea that samples for normal tissues in patients affected by cancer can contain a high rate of putative functionally deleterious variants than samples from healthy individuals. constrastrank allows us to prioritize possible cancer driver genes. we first compared the performance of contrastrank against mutsigcv using three different manually curated lists of cancer-related genes, namely bushman, cosmic census and vogelstein (see section 2.5). although a real evaluation of the performance is still a difficult task in absence of a true benchmark set, contrastrank performs better than mutsigcv for all three tumor types under study (supplementary). using the fishers exact test to compare the number of oncogenes in highly ranked pigs and the number of oncogenes over the remaining genes, we found p-values lower than 10 7 for all the benchmark sets. in addition, we found that eight of our highly ranked genes are included in the list of 11 high significantly mutated colorectal cancer genes provided by broad institute (http://cancergenome.broadinstitute.org/). the same analysis on luad dataset detected 319 pigs, between 5 to 15 of which are in the three cancer gene lists. comparing the fraction of oncogene in the highly ranked genes against the number of oncogenes on the remaining genes, we found a significant p-value lower than 0.01. comparing our list of luad genes with score43 with the list provided by broad institute, we found 11 common genes over 14. similar results are obtained for prostate cancer for which we found a total number of 96 highly scored genes, 5 to 19 of which are also in the benchmark lists of cancer-related genes. also in this case, the comparison of the distributions of cancer genes in low and high scored subset resulted in fishers exact test p-values lower than 0.01. in the case of prad, the broad institute only reports one gene that is also included in the list of our highly scored genes. all the numbers about the comparison between the gene lists obtained using contrastrank and those in bushman, cosmic census and vogelstein gene lists are summarized in supplementary table s4. we showed that contrastrank scores could discriminate tcga normal from tumor samples, as well as different types of adenocarcinomas from each other. using genes with score higher than 3, we showed that our approach could discriminate tumor from normal samples with an overall accuracy 490 and auc 40.95 for each tumor type (see). good levels of performances are also obtained in a more stringent test (cv unseen) in which the normal and tumor samples with same identifier were kept disjoint (supplementary). furthermore, the difference of contrastrank scores could discriminate different tumor types. using a cutoff score of 3, the results show that in the worst case (luad), our method reaches an average overall accuracy of 77 and auc 0.83. better performances are obtained for prad and coad . these results are in agreement with the analysis of highly scored genes for each tumor type. using common size datasets composed by 220 samples equally distributed between positive and negative cases, we found 139, 318 and 96 high scored genes (average score43) for coad, luad and prad, respectively. comparing these lists of genes we found that 75 and 40 of highly scored pigs in prad and coad respectively are overlapping with highly scored genes in luad . in this scenario, luad seems to involve a larger spectrum of pigs with respect to coad and prad. the observed heterogeneity could i577 contrastrank be explained by larger sample size for the luad dataset, this reasoning is not true for coad that in spite of having around 2/3 of the samples in the prad dataset (supplementary) results in higher number of high scored pigs. our analysis also revealed that tp53, braf, ar, nbea, rnf145 are the five common pigs across the three adenocarcinomas. in conclusion, in this paper we presented contastrank, a new method for prioritizing cancer-related genes. according to our analysis, our method is able to detect already well-known genes and identify new genes potentially involved in the insurgence and progression of tumor. although we showed that contastrank reaches good performance even when compared against mutsigcv, a further calibration of the method is needed before it could be applied to larger sets of genomic data. the main hurdles are standardization of the variant calling procedure, optimization of the method for selecting pdvs, inclusion of other types of variants other than nonsynonymous and selection of representative set of normal samples that capture genetic heterogeneity of each tumor type.
