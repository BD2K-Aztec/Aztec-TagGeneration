functional association networks as priors for gene regulatory network inference motivation: gene regulatory network (grn) inference reveals the influences genes have on one another in cellular regulatory systems. if the experimental data are inadequate for reliable inference of the network , informative priors have been shown to improve the accuracy of inferences. results: this study explores the potential of undirected, confidence-weighted networks, such as those in functional association databases, as a prior source for grn inference. such networks often erroneously indicate symmetric interaction between genes and may contain mostly correlation-based interaction information. despite these drawbacks, our testing on synthetic datasets indicates that even noisy priors reflect some causal information that can improve grn inference accuracy. our analysis on yeast data indicates that using the functional association databases funcoup and string as priors can give a small improvement in grn inference accuracy with biological data.gene regulatory network (grn) inference determines causal influences in gene networks and is useful for understanding regulation, usually at the transcriptional level, which can hypothetically lead to effective modification of regulatory networks. grn inference has been studied extensively over the past decade as described in the following reviews (; tegn er and bj orkegren, 2007). in grns the nodes are genes and the edges are influences, annotated with a direction and signed strength. these networks are normally constructed using transcriptomic data from experiments in which all of the genes in the network of interest have been perturbed, often with rnai knockdowns. gene expression is profiled either in a time series or when the system has reached a steady-state. a plethora of inference methods have been developed and are based on information theory , boolean networks , bayesian networks and ordinary differential equations (odes;; gustafsson and h ornquist,). a subset of the methods based on a ode description formulates the inference as a convex programming problem . the dialogue on reverse engineering assessment and methods (dream) and other benchmarking studies have shown that although many methods perform better than random, there is a lot of room for improvement. it is difficult to determine the true grn for a biological system because even if major characteristics such as transcription factor binding are known, subtle influences may not be well understood. to avoid this problem, many benchmarking studies use synthetic data where the true grn is known and the accuracy of inference methods can be analysed. genenetweaver (gnw;) generated synthetic networks and datasets for three of the dream competitions and this program uses nonlinear dynamical models of transcription and translation. another synthetic data generation program, genespider (, manuscript in preparation), uses a linear dynamical model of transcription. these two programs were used in our study to generate synthetic data. prior knowledge may be incorporated into the inference method in order to improve accuracy and can also increase efficiency by reducing the search space. researchers have begun to explore these possibilities by using pathways , transcription factor binding (; gustafsson and h ornquist, 2010; shih and), proteinprotein interactions , gene ontology , epigenetics and literature . these studies incorporate the prior in different ways, but for inference methods which minimize a penalty function, the prior knowledge is often quantified as the unlikelihood of a link, and this value is multiplied by the sparsity term in the penalty function (; gustafsson and h ornquist, 2010). the prior value has also been discretized to be positive, negative or zero and used as a constraint in an optimization . although there have been several studies, none of them has been good enough to become a widespread standard. a comprehensive, user-friendly prior can be constructed using functional association data: undirected, confidence-weighted to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution non-commercial license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/ by-nc/3.0/), which permits non-commercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. for commercial re-use, please contact journals.permissions@oup.com values (between 0 and 1) indicating the possibility of an interaction between two genes. one good place to find such data is in functional association databases, which aggregate heterogeneous experimental data and output a confidence score describing the probability of a functional linkage between two proteins. funcoup and the search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes (string) are two examples of such databases which aggregate data from literature, protein interactions, genomics, orthology, coexpression and subcellular localization in order to calculate the probability of a functional association. although these databases pairwise confidence scores were not created to be priors for grn inference, they may contain enough information to improve grn accuracy. the pairwise confidence scores from functional association databases can be used to create an undirected, confidenceweighted likelihood matrix that can be easily incorporated as a prior into a grn inference method.used first-generation functional association databases prolinks and predictome as part of a gene biclustering algorithm but not explicitly in the network inference. to our knowledge no one has extensively studied the potential of undirected, unsigned, confidenceweighted networks as priors for grn inference. in this study we generated synthetic datasets of steady-state expression data and functional association-like priors, assumed a dynamical systems model, and used a convex optimization-based inference method. we compared the accuracy of the grn inferences with and without the priors to determine if and when undirected, unsigned, confidence-weighted networks improve grn inference. we also explored a few different experimental (perturbation) designs to see if they had an impact on the priors usefulness. finally, we applied our method to a yeast dataset and used funcoup and string to generate priors to see if they can improve network inference with biological data.in the synthetic analysis we generated 5 true networks and 150 expression datasets (covering 3 experimental designs) using nonlinear (gnw) and linear (gsp) generation methods. we used these datasets along with 150 priors (covering 6 different i132 accuracy levels), and completed over 1.7 million inferences to determine if and when a functional association prior improves grn inference. since we were unable to find a method to optimally set our sparsity parameter, we evaluated the inference accuracy over all sparsity levels (except self-interactions were always non-zero). there were five networks used in the analysis, and since their individual results were similar, we have only shown the combined results. also, there was never a perfect inference; the best inference recovered 99 of the links, so there was always room for improvement. a perfect prior never resulted in a perfect inference because of noise and the fact that these priors are symmetrical (i.e. that do not give interaction direction) and our true networks were not symmetrical. in the results below, improvement is defined as the inference accuracy percentage of the method using the simulated functional association prior minus the inference accuracy percentage of the method using the na ve prior.
