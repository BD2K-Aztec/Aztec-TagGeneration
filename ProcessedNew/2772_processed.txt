madgene: retrieval and processing of gene identifier lists for the analysis of heterogeneous microarray datasets madgene is a software environment comprising a web-based database and a java application. this platform aims at unifying gene identifiers (ids) and performing gene set analysis. madgene allows the user to perform inter-conversion of clone and gene ids over a large range of nomenclatures relative to 17 species. we propose a set of 23 functions to facilitate the analysis of gene sets and we give two microarray applications to show how madgene can be used to conduct meta-analyses. availability: the madgene resources are freely available online from http://www.madtools.org, a website dedicated to the analysis and annotation of dna microarray data.the analysis of heterogeneous data is a time-consuming and tedious task. many tools exist for mapping gene ids across several references and species (see 14 references in supplementary material 1). although these resources offer many interesting options, our platform has the advantage of integrating three essential features: the capacity to annotate heterogeneous id lists, a large coverage of species and an easy-to-use application for investigating multiple gene lists, which includes relational operators and multiple statistical tests.a wide range of analyses can be conducted from gene lists. for concision sake, we only focused on a particular example of use: gene lists taken from public microarray samples. we give two applications to indicate the pertinence and reliability of our tool. the first one compares samples issued from several human datasets related to duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd). the second application identifies matching regions between two hierarchical clusterings related to two species (human dmd and mouse mdx). all the computations were performed with emadgene. all the figures were drawn using r graphical functions.
