systems biology lpnet: a linear programming approach to reconstruct signal transduction networks with the widespread availability of high-throughput experimental technologies it has become possible to study hundreds to thousands of cellular factors simultaneously, such as coding or non-coding mrna or protein concentrations. still, extracting information about the underlying regulatory or signaling interactions from these data remains a difficult challenge. we present a flexible approach towards network inference based on linear programming. our method reconstructs the interactions of factors from a combination of perturbation/non-perturbation and steady-state/time-series data. we show both on simulated and real data that our methods are able to reconstruct the underlying networks fast and efficiently, thus shedding new light on biological processes and, in particular, into diseases mechanisms of action. we have implemented the approach as an r package available through bioconductor.using network inference approaches it is possible to understand how different cellular components (e.g. genes, proteins, metabolites) interact with each other. several methods for network inference exist, such as boolean networks , (dynamic) bayesian networks (bn) and methods based on differential equations . boolean networks scale up well for larger networks and are easy to interpret. yet, the biological signal is binarized which leads to a substantial loss of information. bn and differential equations allow for a more detailed modeling of the underlying processes, but they are often applicable only to small-scale problems as they usually scale-up poorly. one of the major recent approaches to model signaling networks based on perturbation data are the nested effects models (nems) which have been widely applied and extended in different ways. this approach assumes a small number of candidate pathway genes which are silenced (s-genes), and the effects of this silencing are measured on a large set of effects genes (e-genes)thus using indirect observations of effects for network inference. approaches that use direct observations from perturbed networks obtained either at a single or several time-points include). however, many of the published network inference approaches are computationally expensive and thus not suitable for large networks. also, although many methods are publicly available, a substantial fraction of them are dependent on 3rd-party proprietary software (e.g. matlab) and are not properly documented, thus making them very hard to use. here, we present a flexible approach implemented as a bioconductor package, lpnet, freely available for any of the major operating systems. the method implemented in lpnet extends a previously developed method in by adding support for time-series data. as a result, the method is now suited for any combination of perturbation/non-perturbation and steady-state/ time-series data, and not only for perturbation steady-state data, as in the previous version of 2013. furthermore, the calculation of a nodes activity, which directly influences the resulting network, was improved, leading to more accurate results. finally, since the method is formulated as a linear programming approach, inferring networks becomes fast and efficient even for large-scale problems.the performance of the first version of lpnet, suitable only for perturbation steady-state data, has been assessed . as for the latest version, with support for a combination of perturbation/non-perturbation and steady-state/time-series data, it has been used in the dream 8 competition, in the hpn-dream breast cancer network inference challenge, where it scored third for the in silico challenge (auroc: 0.68) and 29th for the experimental challenge (auroc: 0.57) without using prior information, among more than 60 competing groups. in the in silico challenge the goal was to infer the causal edges in a 20 node network given a dataset containing the 20 nodes observations across 10 time points and 4 perturbation experiments (one of these being the control). in the experimental challenge the goal was to infer 32 causal networks, one for each combination of cell line stimulusthere were 4 cell lines and 8 different stimuli. each of the 32 datasets contained $45 nodes observations across 7 time points and 4 inhibition experiments (one of these being the control). in the supplementary information, section 3, we briefly compare lpnet with ddepn , a method also implemented as a well-documented r package and suitable for the same type of data. two conclusions from this comparison are worth emphasizing: i) lpnet is very robust against noise; ii) on the same platform, lpnet takes on average 15 min to infer a network with 10 nodes, 10 time points and 2 perturbations, while ddepn takes, on average, 101 min (computations done on an intel xeon x5460 @ 3 ghz, 26mb l2 cache, 32gb ram, 64 bit linux os). more detailed results are presented in the supplementary materials and in .
