genome analysis binary interval search: a scalable algorithm for counting interval intersections motivation: the comparison of diverse genomic datasets is fundamental to understand genome biology. researchers must explore many large datasets of genome intervals (e.g. genes, sequence alignments) to place their experimental results in a broader context and to make new discoveries. relationships between genomic datasets are typically measured by identifying intervals that intersect, that is, they overlap and thus share a common genome interval. given the continued advances in dna sequencing technologies, efficient methods for measuring statistically significant relationships between many sets of genomic features are crucial for future discovery. results: we introduce the binary interval search (bits) algorithm, a novel and scalable approach to interval set intersection. we demonstrate that bits outperforms existing methods at counting interval intersections. moreover, we show that bits is intrinsically suited to parallel computing architectures, such as graphics processing units by illustrating its utility for efficient monte carlo simulations measuring the significance of relationships between sets of genomic intervals. availability: https://github.com/arq5x/bits.searching for intersecting intervals in multiple sets of genomic features is crucial to nearly all genomic analyses. for example, interval intersection is used to compare chip enrichment between experiments and cell types, identify potential regulatory targets and compare genetic variation among many individuals. interval intersection is the fundamental operation in a broader class of genome arithmetic techniques, and as such, it underlies the functionality found in many genome analysis software packages . as high-throughput sequencing technologies have become the de facto molecular tool for genome biology, there is an acute need for efficient approaches to interval intersection. microarray techniques for measuring gene expression and chromatin states have been largely supplanted by sequencing-based techniques, and whole-exome and whole-genome experiments are now routine. consequently, most genomics laboratories now conduct analyses including datasets with billions of genome intervals. experiments of this size require substantial computation time per pairwise comparison. moreover, typical analyses require comparisons with many large sets of genomic features (where set size refers to the number of intervals in the set). existing approaches scale poorly and are already reaching their performance limits. we, therefore, argue the need for new scalable algorithms to allow discovery to keep pace with the scale and complexity of modern datasets. in this manuscript, we introduce the binary interval search (bits) algorithm as a novel and scalable solution to the fundamental problem of counting the number of intersections between two sets of genomic intervals. bits uses two binary searches (one each for start and end coordinates) to identify intersecting intervals. as such, our algorithm executes in n log n time, where n is the number of intervals, which can be shown to be optimal for the interval intersection counting problem by a straightforward reduction to element uniqueness (known to be n log n . in contrast, counting intersections by enumeration is less efficient, as enumerating intervals requires time m n log n, where m is the number of intersections that can be quadratic to the input size. we illustrate that a sequential version of bits outperforms existing approaches and show that bits is intrinsically suited to parallel architectures. the parallel version performs the same amount of work as the sequential version (i.e. there is no overhead), which means the algorithm is work efficient, and because each parallel thread performs equivalent work, bits has little thread divergence. although thread divergence degrades performance on any architecture (finished threads must wait for overburdened threads to complete), the impact is particularity acute for graphics processing units (gpus) where threads share a program counter and any divergent instruction must be executed on every thread.we have developed a novel algorithm for interval intersection that is uniquely suited to scalable computing architectures, such as gpus. our algorithm takes a new approach to counting intersections: unlike existing methods that must enumerate intersections to derive a count, bits uses two binary searches to directly infer the count by excluding intervals that cannot intersect one another. we have demonstrated that a sequential implementation of bits outperforms existing tools and illustrated that bits is task efficient and highly parallelizable. bits is also memory efficient: our mc simulation required 217 mb of random access memory and the sequential implementation consumed 412 mb of random access memory, versus 790 mb for ucsc and 3588 mb for bedtools. we show that a gpu implementation of bits is, therefore, a superior solution for mc analyses of statistical relationships between genome intervals sets. given the efficiency with which the bits algorithm counts intersections, it is also well suited to other genomic analyses, including rna-seq transcript quantification, chip-seq peak detection and searches for copy-number and structural variation. moreover, the functional and regulatory data produced by projects, such as encode, have led to new approaches for measuring relationships among genomic features. we recognize the importance of scalable approaches for detecting such relationships, and we anticipate that our new algorithm will foster new genome mining tools for the genomics community.
