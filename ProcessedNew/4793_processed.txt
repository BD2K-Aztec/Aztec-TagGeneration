sequence analysis uninovo: a universal tool for de novo peptide sequencing motivation: mass spectrometry (ms) instruments and experimental protocols are rapidly advancing, but de novo peptide sequencing algorithms to analyze tandem mass (ms/ms) spectra are lagging behind. although existing de novo sequencing tools perform well on certain types of spectra [e.g. collision induced dissociation (cid) spectra of tryptic peptides], their performance often deteriorates on other types of spectra, such as electron transfer dissociation (etd), higher-energy collisional dissociation (hcd) spectra or spectra of non-tryptic digests. thus, rather than developing a new algorithm for each type of spectra, we develop a universal de novo sequencing algorithm called uninovo that works well for all types of spectra or even for spectral pairs (e.g. cid/etd spectral pairs). uninovo uses an improved scoring function that captures the dependences between different ion types, where such dependencies are learned automatically using a modified offset frequency function. results: the performance of uninovo is compared with pepnovo, peaks and pnovo using various types of spectra. the results show that the performance of uninovo is superior to other tools for etd spectra and superior or comparable with others for cid and hcd spectra. uninovo also estimates the probability that each reported reconstruction is correct, using simple statistics that are readily obtained from a small training dataset. we demonstrate that the estimation is accurate for all tested types of spectra (including cid, hcd, etd, cid/etd and hcd/etd spectra of trypsin, lysc or aspn digested peptides). availability: uninovo is implemented in java and tested on windows, ubuntu and os x machines. uninovo is available at http://proteomics. ucsd.edu/software/uninovo.html along with the manual.de novo peptide sequencing by tandem mass (ms/ms) spectrometry is a valuable alternative to ms/ms database search. in contrast to the database search approach that utilizes the information from proteome, the de novo sequencing approach attempts to identify peptides only using the information from the input spectrum. hence, most de novo sequencing algorithms are based on the prior knowledge of the fragmentation characteristics (e.g. ion types and their propensities) of ms/ms spectra . the fragmentation characteristics are highly dependent on the fragmentation method used to generate the spectrum. among several fragmentation methods available, the collision-induced dissociation (cid) is the most commonly used method. accordingly, the fragmentation characteristics of cid have been well studied compared with recently introduced fragmentation methods, such as electron transfer dissociation (etd) and higher-energy collisional dissociation (hcd) . as a result, many de novo sequencing algorithms have been introduced for cid spectra; for example, peaks and pepnovo are the state of the art de novo sequencing tools for cid spectra. other fragmentation methods like etd and hcd have a great potential for de novo sequencing. for example, for highly charged spectra, etd provides better fragmentation and thus is better suited for de novo sequencing than cid . also, more complete fragmentation of peptide ions (especially in low mass regions) in hcd provides a better chance to obtain more accurate de novo reconstructions than cid . furthermore, modern mass spectrometers (e.g. ltq-orbitrap velos) allow the generation of paired spectra (e.g. cid/etd or hcd/etd spectral pairs). since cid (or hcd) and etd spectra provide complementary information for peptide sequencing , such spectral pairs (or even triplets) enable more accurate de novo sequencing. several de novo sequencing algorithms were recently presented to take advantage of those new fragmentation methods. for instance,proposed a de novo sequencing algorithm for etd spectra, which is used by peaks. for hcd spectra,introduced a de novo sequencing tool, pnovo, that not only takes advantage of the high precision peaks in hcd spectra but also uses the information of abundant immonium and internal ions. in case of spectral pairs,proposed a greedy algorithm (for cid/ecd spectral pairs) that significantly boosts the performance of de novo sequencing. datta andpresented spectrum fusion, a de novo sequencing algorithm for cid/etd spectral pairs. spectrum fusion constructs a combined spectrum from the input cid/etd spectral pair using a bayesian network. it generates multiple de novo sequences using the combined spectrum and score them by the scoring function in byonic .this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution non-commercial license

spectrum, using peaks. the total 2000 candidate sequences are then rescored against the input spectral pair, and the best-scoring peptide is reported. while the above tools perform well for the spectra generated from the fragmentation method(s) that each tool targeted, they often generate inferior results for the spectra from other fragmentation methods. moreover, if alternative proteases (e.g. lysc or aspn) are used for protein digestion, these tools may produce suboptimal results because different proteases often generate peptides with different fragmentation characteristics . in case of the database search approach,recently introduced a universal algorithm ms-gfdb that shows a significantly better peptide identification performance than other existing database search tools such as mascot percolator . however, a universal de novo sequencing tool is still missing. we present uninovo, a universal de novo sequencing tool that can be generalized for various types (i.e. the combinations of the fragmentation method and the protease used to digest sample proteins) of spectra. the scoring function of uninovo is easily trainable using a training dataset consisting of thousands of annotated spectra. all information needed for de novo sequencing are learned from the training dataset, and the running time for training is 55 h in a typical desktop environment. currently, uninovo is trained for cid, hcd and etd spectra of trypsin, lysc or aspn digested peptides. we show that the performance of uninovo is better than or comparable with pepnovo, peaks and pnovo for various types of spectra. one of the biggest challenges in de novo sequencing is to estimate the error rate of the resulting de novo reconstructions. unlike ms/ms database search tools that commonly uses the target-decoy approach to estimate the statistical significance of the peptide identifications, de novo reconstructions have rarely been subjected to a statistical significance analysis in the past. several de novo sequencing tools report the error rate of amino acid predictions (e.g. confidence scores in peaks), but this is often not sufficient because the overall quality of the sequence cannot be easily determined by the error rates of individual amino acid predictions. to our knowledge, only pepnovo reports the empirical probability that the output peptide is correct. pepnovo predicts the probabilities using logistic regression with multiple features of the reconstructions such as length and score, which are extracted from a training dataset consisting of hundreds of thousands of annotated spectra . however, pepnovo does not include an automated training procedure (that would allow to easily extend pepnovo for newly emerging mass spectrometry approaches) and is currently trained only for cid [extending pepnovo beyond cid spectra requires training complex boosting-based re-ranking models for predicting peak ranks and rescoring peptide candidates. pepnovo training includes several manual steps and the availability of a very large corpus of training spectra (. thus, in case of non-cid fragmentation methods, it remains unclear how to obtain accurate error rate estimation for de novo reconstructions. uninovo estimates the probability that each reported reconstruction is correct, using simple statistics that are readily obtained from a small training dataset. we demonstrate that the estimation is accurate for all tested types of spectra (including cid, hcd, etd, cid/etd and hcd/etd spectra of trypsin, lysc or aspn digested peptides). this allows uninovo to automatically filter out low quality spectra.we presented a universal de novo sequencing tool uninovo that works well for various types of spectra. uninovo can be easily trained for different types of spectra using only thousands of psms that typically can be obtained from a single ms/ms run. the experimental results show that uninovo generates accurate and long de novo reconstructions from spectra of cid, etd, hcd and cid/etd fragmentation methods and spectra of trypsin, lysc or aspn digested peptides. we also showed that uninovo is better than or comparable with other state of the art tools. as pointed out by ma and johnson (2011), de novo sequences not only are valuable for the analysis of the novel peptides that are not present in proteome databases but also can facilitate the homology-based database searches. since the reconstructions reported by uninovo contain mass gaps representing the total mass of multiple amino acids [termed gapped peptides (, ms-bpm algorithm can be used for fast exact or homology searches (uninovoms-bpm). ms-bpm enables searches against a sequence database using gapped peptides as queries. currently msbpm takes gapped peptides generated by ms-gappeddictionary (ms-gappeddictionaryms-bpm). however, the reconstructions from uninovo are usually longer than those from ms-gappeddictionary (89 versus 56). since the search time of ms-bpm strongly depends on the length of gapped peptidesthe longer gapped peptides, the shorter search timethe running time of uninovoms-bpm is smaller than ms-gappeddictionaryms-bpm by an order of magnitude in a blind search against the ipi human proteome database ver.3.87 (data not shown).. de novo sequencing with qualify filtering of spectra. given a spectrum, if the parameter setaccuracythreshold is set, uninovo attempts to achieve set accuracy (an estimated probability of the spectrum being correctly sequenced) exceeding setaccuracythreshold. if it fails to generate such a set, the spectrum is filtered out. an unfiltered spectrum is called a qualified spectrum. we set setaccuracythreshold 0:8.
