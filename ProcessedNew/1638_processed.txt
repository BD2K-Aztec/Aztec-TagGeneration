gene expression estimation of gfp-tagged rna numbers from temporal fluorescence intensity data motivation: ms2-gfp-tagging of rna is currently the only method to measure intervals between consecutive transcription events in live cells. for this, new transcripts must be accurately detected from intensity time traces. results: we present a novel method for automatically estimating rna numbers and production intervals from temporal data of cell fluores-cence intensities that reduces uncertainty by exploiting temporal information. we also derive a robust variant, more resistant to outliers caused e.g. by rnas moving out of focus. using monte carlo simulations , we show that the quantification of rna numbers and production intervals is generally improved compared with previous methods. finally, we analyze data from live escherichia coli and show statistically significant differences to previous methods. the new methods can be used to quantify numbers and production intervals of any fluorescent probes, which are present in low copy numbers, are brighter than the cell background and degrade slowly. availability: source code is available under mozilla public license attranscription, translation and degradation of rna and proteins are stochastic processes . their stochasticity results in phenotypic variability in monoclonal cell populations and temporal phenotypic changes in cells . as such, to better understand phenotypic diversity, the mechanisms regulating rna and protein numbers must be understood. presently, the only technique for quantifying rna numbers and transcription dynamics in live escherichia coli cells over time consists of tagging target rna molecules with an array of fluorescent ms2-gfp proteins . using this technique, the target rna can be visualized as a bright spot (see e.g.) shortly after production . this method allows studying transcription in the absence of several sources of stochasticity , such as rna degradation or dilution by cell division . the quantification of transcription dynamics from fluorescence microscopy images requires estimation of the rna numbers or the rna production times using statistics extracted from microscopy images, such as temporal intensity signals. some methods have been proposed for determining rna numbers using cell and/or fluorescence spot intensities, either using manually assisted or automatic techniques. however, these methods were designed to extract stationary rna distributions from cell populations, and as such, they neglect any temporal information in the data. recently, we introduced a method to use such information to extract time intervals between consecutive rna productions in individual cells. this method uses a piecewise-constant monotonic least-squares (lsq) fit with an f-test to select the model order, after which a jump in the model curve is taken to correspond to the production of a target rna. unfortunately, this method does not extract the absolute rna numbers. here, we propose a new method for automatic quantification of rna numbers and rna production intervals from intensity time series extracted from cells. specifically, we consider two variants: one that uses lsq costs, which can be derived using the central limit theorem, and one that uses least-deviations (ld) costs, which is a robust variant of the former. in particular, the latter was designed to counter outliers commonly observed in the intensity data, caused by e.g. rna molecules moving out of the focal plane, at the cost of reduced accuracy. the new method was designed to exploit the temporal information in the data for improved accuracy, to not require post-and/or pre-processing for time interval extraction and to be free of any regularization in temporal domain to allow more accurate quantification of time intervals. first, we present monte carlo simulations to demonstrate that the accuracy of the method is, in general, superior to the existing methods, in estimating both rna numbers and rna production intervals. second, we apply our method and the previous methods on novel data extracted from time-lapse microscopy measurements of live e.coli cells expressing ms2-gfp and rna target to show that, for large number of cells, statistically significant differences in the results can be detected between the new and previous methods, in both rna numbers and rna production time intervals. to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. all rights reserved. for permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.comwe have presented two variants of a novel, more accurate method for the automatic quantification of rna numbers and rna production intervals from intensity time series extracted from images of live cells expressing fluorescently tagged rna molecules. the new method exploits the temporal information in the data for improved accuracy, does not require post-and/or pre-processing for time interval extraction and has no regularization in the temporal domain. one of the proposed variants uses lsq costs, which can be derived using the central limit theorem. the other uses ld costs, which is a robust variant of the former, and is to be used when there is potential for outliers (e.g. spots transiently leaving the focal plane of the microscope). meanwhile, the former is preferred when no such corruption is present (e.g. if using multiple slices along the z-axis at each time point).we used monte carlo simulations to demonstrate that the accuracy of the new methods is, in general, superior to that of our two previously proposed methods , both in estimating the rna numbers and the rna production intervals. we also applied the new and the previous methods on novel data from time-lapse images of live e.coli cells expressing rna target for ms2-gfp to show that, if the data contains large number of cells, statistically significant differences in the results can be detected, in both the rna numbers and rna production time intervals. in this regard, it should be noted that such large numbers of cells are required to, e.g. compare changes in the dynamics of rna production by a promoter when under different temperatures or levels of induction . currently, ms2-gfp-tagging of rna molecules is the only existing method for detecting rna molecules, as they are produced in live cells. an accurate quantification of the copy numbers of these tagged rna molecules and determination of the moments when they first appear are essential, particularly in studies of the dynamics of transcription in live cells [see e.g.. such measurements are currently being used to assess, for example, the role of induction and repression mechanisms in regulating gene expression dynamics or the effects of environmental factors such as temperature on this dynamics. however, detection and quantification of individual, tagged rna molecules, and thus our method, are valuable to other endeavors as well. for example, recent uses of the counting of such molecules as they appear in cells include a study of the dynamics of small genetic circuits and a study of errors in the partitioning of rna molecules in cell division . the two variants of the method proposed here should prove valuable in increasing the accuracy of these, as well as of other studies making use of fluorescent molecules, provided that the fluorescent molecules exist in small numbers in each cell, that their fluorescence is significantly above the background fluorescence and that they have a slow degradation rate when compared with dilution caused by cell division.
