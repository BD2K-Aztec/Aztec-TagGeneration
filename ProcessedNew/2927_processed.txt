metdraw: automated visualization of genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions and high-throughput data motivation: metabolic reaction maps allow visualization of genome-scale models and high-throughput data in a format familiar to many biologists. however, creating a map of a large metabolic model is a difficult and time-consuming process. metdraw fully automates the map-drawing process for metabolic models containing hundreds to thousands of reactions. metdraw can also overlay high-throughput omics data directly on the generated maps. availability and implementation: web interface and source code are freely available atthe number of genome-scale metabolic models has increased greatly in recent years . an accompanying expansion in available algorithms for analyzing these models in the context of high-throughput data has created the need for tools to visualize large models and datasets. cytoscape and similar graph-drawing software can visualize arbitrary biological networks. however, the resulting node-and-edge graphs are visually distinct from the more familiar metabolic map layout where lines show the flow of reactants coming together before branching into products. only a few genome-scale metabolic reconstructions include a manually curated visualization. however, producing these maps is difficult and time-consuming, and the maps are rarely updated as the model is revised. the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) and other metabolic pathway databases provide visualizations of indexed reactions, but these maps exclude reactions not in the database (such as transport or speciesspecific reactions). metabolic modeling software packages such as the cobra toolbox and cellnetanalyzer can overlay flux and gene expression data on reaction maps. although both packages allow users to modify existing maps, no software package is capable of assembling a complete genome-scale metabolic map de novo from a set of reactions.
