gene expression seganndb: interactive web-based genomic segmentation motivation: dna copy number profiles characterize regions of chromosome gains, losses and breakpoints in tumor genomes. although many models have been proposed to detect these alterations , it is not clear which model is appropriate before visual inspection the signal, noise and models for a particular profile. results: we propose seganndb, a web-based computer vision system for genomic segmentation: first, visually inspect the profiles and manually annotate altered regions, then seganndb determines the precise alteration locations using a mathematical model of the data and annotations. seganndb facilitates collaboration between biologists and bioinformaticians, and uses the university of california, santa cruz genome browser to visualize copy number alterations alongside known genes. availability and implementation: the breakpoints project on inria gforge hosts the source code, an amazon machine image can be launched and a demonstration web site is http://bioviz.rocq.inria.fr.dna copy number alterations (cnas) are amplifications, gains and losses of chromosomal regions that can result from different cellular mechanisms, and are important in the study of many types of cancer . genome-wide assays such as array comparative genomic hybridization (acgh) and single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays can be used to detect cnas. after spatial and sample normalization, these assays yield noisy measurements of approximate copy number with a resolution of up to 1 kb between probes. the goal in analyzing these data is to accurately extract a list of altered regions from each noisy sample. in this article, we define accuracy in terms of annotated regions given by an expert. we treat this expert as a gold standard, and so the goal of our model is to be consistent with his or her annotations.observed large annotation error rates for several segmentation algorithms applied to a large database of neuroblastoma tumors. in this article, we propose to eliminate these errors with seganndb, a computer vision system whose model always agrees with the provided annotations. previous work in dna copy number analysis can be roughly divided into two categories of methods: visualization and mathematical models. this article combines these two lines of research by proposing a mathematical model that can be iteratively improved by adding visual annotations to zoomed scatterplots of the data. first, we will review previous methods in both categories. many software packages have been developed for visualization of acgh data. for example, visualization and analysis of molecular profiles (vamp) can be used for exploratory analysis, or to visualize predicted alterations from a model . another visual analysis program is charmview, which allows manual identification of regions for significance testing . a potential problem with these programs is that the displayed model is calculated before visualization, and cannot be interactively updated. several web sites for array cgh analysis have been proposed. cghweb allows visual comparison of several algorithms applied to the same normalized profile . arraycyght and capweb provide normalization and copy number calling . isacgh supports analysis, segmentation, visualization and export to the ensembl genome browser . arrayfusion exports data and segmentations in formats suitable for genome browsers . like the method we propose in this article, these web sites facilitate collaboration with biologists. unlike these web sites, our seganndb software allows the user to interactively update the displayed segmentation model. in contrast to visual methods for alteration detection, mathematical models can be used to automatically predict lists of alterations based on certain mathematical assumptions about the data. the available mathematical models specifically designed for detecting cnas are summarized by. however, a major problem with this class of methods is to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. model selection. given a particular dataset to analyze, it is obvious to choose neither a particular model nor its tuning parameters. how to evaluate which model is best? without doing more experiments, the only method of evaluation is to plot the model alongside scatterplots of the data. a good model should capture all visible alterations in the data and should not predict any false-positive detections. this visual criterion for model evaluation can be used by creating a database of annotated regions that encode an experts interpretation of the data . in that study, default parameter values of several models were shown to yield many false-positive and false-negative detections. and even after tuning the parameters of each model, there were no models with perfect detection accuracy. in this article, we propose to solve this problem by interactively annotating alterations in scatterplots of the data . then our software selects a tuning parameter that agrees with the user-defined annotations and immediately shows the updated model. if the displayed segmentation model does not capture the alterations that are obvious from visual inspection, then annotations can be added to correct the model. a user-specific model can thus be iteratively improved until it agrees with the annotators visual interpretation of the data. in addition, the annotations can be assembled into a database, so we can apply algorithms that automatically recognize previously annotated patterns. we note that this computer vision approach has also been successful for recognizing phenotypes in cell microscopy . after annotating a small subset of the data, the system adapts to the annotations and provides consistent predictions for unannotated data. this article describes seganndb, a web-based free/opensource implementation of this interactive genomic segmentation model. the name is short for segmentation and annotation database, as annotations are stored in a database, which is used by machine learning algorithms to find an appropriate segmentation. after interactive annotation, the learned segmentation model can be directly exported to the university of california, santa cruz (ucsc) genome browser for viewing detected alterations alongside known genes . finally, seganndb promotes collaboration between biologists, doctors and bioinformaticians doing genome-wide copy number analysis . collaboration using seganndb is simple: once a bioinformatician uploads a profile, anyone with a web browser can create a user-specific segmentation model by drawing annotated regions on the scatterplots . this makes it easy for people with expert prior knowledge but no programming experience to browse the profiles and annotate regions of interest (e.g. a biologist looking for alterations in known oncogenes). after annotation, the bioinformatician can download the annotations and segmentation model for further analyses such as detection of common alterations in several related samples, or survival regression based on the detected alterations.
