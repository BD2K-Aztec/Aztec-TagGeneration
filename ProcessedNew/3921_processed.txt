genome analysis real time metagenomics: using k-mers to annotate metagenomes annotation of metagenomes involves comparing the individual sequence reads with a database of known sequences and assigning a unique function to each read. this is a time-consuming task that is computationally intensive (though not computationally complex). here we present a novel approach to annotate metagenomes using unique k-mer oligopeptide sequences from 7 to 12 amino acids long. we demonstrate that k-mer-based annotations are faster and approach the sensitivity and precision of blastx-based annotations without loosing accuracy. a last-common ancestor approach was also developed to describe the members of the community. availability and implementation: this open-source application was implemented in perl and can be accessed via a user-friendly website at http://edwards.sdsu.edu/rtmg. in addition, code to access the annotation servers is available for download from http://www.theseed .org/. figfams and k-mers are available for download from ftp://ftp .theseed.org/figfams/.metagenomics has revolutionized microbial ecology. the extraction, purification and sequencing steps have been trivialized by next generation sequencing approaches, and environmental samples are routinely processed from collection to dna sequence in a matter of days . the bottleneck in metagenomics approaches has become the analysis of the sequences. the computational comparison of sequences against all of the known proteins using blastx is limited by computational resources . here, we describe a novel approach to analysing metagenomic sequences using unique signature k-mers that represent members of a protein family. limited additional computational resources are required when the size of the underlying database doubles, as in the best case the search is dependent on the length of the k-mer. we implemented an api and web servers to support the annotation of metagenomes using k-mers.
