gene expression joint network and node selection for pathway-based genomic data analysis motivation: by capturing various biochemical interactions, biological pathways provide insight into underlying biological processes. given high-dimensional microarray or rna-sequencing data, a critical challenge is how to integrate them with rich information from pathway databases to jointly select relevant pathways and genes for phenotype prediction or disease prognosis. addressing this challenge can help us deepen biological understanding of phenotypes and diseases from a systems perspective. results: in this article, we propose a novel sparse bayesian model for joint network and node selection. this model integrates information from networks (e.g. pathways) and nodes (e.g. genes) by a hybrid of conditional and generative components. for the conditional component , we propose a sparse prior based on graph laplacian matrices, each of which encodes detailed correlation structures between network nodes. for the generative component, we use a spike and slab prior over network nodes. the integration of these two components, coupled with efficient variational inference, enables the selection of networks as well as correlated network nodes in the selected networks. simulation results demonstrate improved predictive performance and selection accuracy of our method over alternative methods. based on three expression datasets for cancer study and the kegg pathway database, we selected relevant genes and pathways, many of which are supported by biological literature. in addition to pathway analysis, our method is expected to have a wide range of applications in selecting relevant groups of correlated high-dimensional biomarkers.with the popularity of high-throughput biological data such as microarray and rna-sequencing data, many variable selection methodssuch as lasso and elastic net have been proposed and applied to select relevant genes for disease diagnosis or prognosis. nevertheless, these approaches ignore invaluable biological pathway information accumulated over decades of research; hence, their selection results can be difficult to interpret biologically and their predictive performance can be limited by a small sample size of expression profiles. to overcome these limitations, a promising direction is to integrate expression profiles with rich biological knowledge in pathway databases. because pathways organize genes into biologically functional groups and model their interactions that capture correlation between genes, this information integration can improve not only the predictive performance but also interpretability of the selection results. thus, a critical need is to integrate pathway information with expression profiles for joint selection of pathways and genes associated with a phenotype or disease. despite their success in many applications, previous sparse learning methods are limited by several factors for the integration of pathway information with expression profiles. for example, group lasso can be used to utilize memberships of genes in pathways via a l 1=2 norm to select groups of genes, but they ignore pathway structural information. an excellent work byovercomes this limitation by incorporating pathway structures in a laplacian matrix of a global graph to guide the selection of relevant genes. in addition to graph laplacians, binary markov random field priors can be used to represent pathway information to influence gene selection . these network-regularized approaches do not explicitly select pathways. however, not all pathways are relevant, and pathway selection can yield insight into underlying biological processes. a pioneering approach to joint pathway and gene selection byuses binary markov random field priors and couples gene and pathway selection by hard constraintsfor example, if a gene is selected, all the pathways it belongs to will be selected. however, this consistency constraint might be too rigid from a biological perspective: an active gene for cancer progression does not necessarily imply that all the pathways it belongs to are active. given the markov random field priors and the nonlinear constraints, posterior distributions are inferred by a markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) method . but the convergence of mcmc for high-dimensional problems is known to take a long time.this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution non-commercial license

sparse prior distribution to select individual networks. for the generative component, we use a spike and slab prior distribution to choose relevant nodes (e.g. genes) in selected networks. for this hybrid model, we do not impose the hard consistency constraints used by. furthermore, the prior distribution of our model does not contain intractable partition functions. this enables us to give a full bayesian treatment over model parameters and develop an efficient variational inference algorithm to obtain approximate posterior distributions for bayesian estimation. as described in section 3, our inference algorithm is designed to handle both continuous and discrete outcomes. simulation results in section 4 demonstrate superior performance of our method over alternative methods for predicting continuous or binary responses, as well as comparable or improved performance for selecting relevant genes and pathways. furthermore, on real expression data for diffuse large b cell lymphoma (dlbcl), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (pdac) and colorectal cancer (crc), our results yield meaningful biological interpretations supported by biological literature.as shown in the previous section, the new bayesian approach, nanos, outperformed the alternative sparse learning methods on both simulation and real data by a large margin. now we discuss three factors that may contribute to the improved performance of nanos. first, the spike and slab prior (3) and its generalization (4) in nanos separate weight regularization from the selection of variables (pathways or genes). both the (generalized) spike and slab prior and elastic net can be viewed as mixture models in which one component encourages the selection of variables and the other helps remove irrelevant ones. however, unlike the elastic net where the weights over l 1 and l 2 penalty functions are fixed, the spike and slab prior has the selection indicators over these two components estimated from data. when a variable is. the predictive performance of nanos when the pathway structures are inaccurate. when more edges are randomly selected and removed from each pathway, the performance of nanos degrades smoothly, but still better than the competing methods
