polytomy refinement for the correction of dubious duplications in gene trees motivation: large-scale methods for inferring gene trees are error-prone. correcting gene trees for weakly supported features often results in non-binary trees, i.e. trees with polytomies, thus raising the natural question of refining such polytomies into binary trees. a feature pointing toward potential errors in gene trees are duplications that are not supported by the presence of multiple gene copies. results: we introduce the problem of refining polytomies in a gene tree while minimizing the number of created non-apparent duplications in the resulting tree. we show that this problem can be described as a graph-theoretical optimization problem. we provide a bounded heur-istic with guaranteed optimality for well-characterized instances. we apply our algorithm to a set of ray-finned fish gene trees from the ensembl database to illustrate its ability to correct dubious duplications. availability and implementation: the c++ source code for the algorithms and simulations described in the article are available atwith the increasing number of completely sequenced genomes, the task of identifying gene counterparts in different organisms becomes more and more important. this is usually done by clustering genes sharing significant sequence similarity, constructing gene trees and then inferring macro-evolutionary events such as duplications, losses or transfers through reconciliation with the phylogenetic tree of the considered taxa. the inference of accurate gene trees is an important step in this pipeline. while gene trees are traditionally constructed solely from sequence alignments , recent methods incorporate information from species phylogenies, gene order and other genomic footprint . a large number of gene tree databases are now available . but constructing accurate gene trees is still challenging; for example, a significant number of nodes in the ensembl gene trees are labelled as dubious . in a recent study, we have been able to show that $30 of 6241 ensembl gene trees for the genomes of the fishes stickleback, medaka, tetraodon and zebrafish exhibit at least one gene order inconsistency and thus are likely to be erroneous . moreover, owing to various reasons such as insufficient differentiation between gene sequences and alignment ambiguities, it is often difficult to support a single gene tree topology with high confidence. several support measures, such as bootstrap values or bayesian posterior probabilities, have been proposed to detect weakly supported edges. recently, intense efforts have been put towards developing tools for gene tree correction (; gorecki and eulenstein, 2011a,b;). a natural approach is to remove a weakly supported edge and collapse its two incident vertices into one , or to remove dubious nodes and join resulting subtrees under a single root . the resulting tree is non-binary with polytomies (multifurcating nodes) representing unresolved parts of the tree. a natural question is then to select a binary refinement of each polytomy based on appropriate criteria. this has been the purpose of a few theoretical and algorithmic studies conducted in the past years, most of them based on minimizing the mutation (i.e. duplication and loss) cost of reconciliation . in the present article, we consider a different reconciliation criterion for refining a polytomy, which consists in minimizing the number of non-apparent duplication (nad) nodes. a duplication node x of a gene tree (according to the reconciliation with a given species tree) is a nad if the genome sets of its two subtrees are disjoint. in other words, the reason x is a duplication is not the presence of paralogs in the same genome, but rather an inconsistency with the species tree. such nodes have been flagged as potential errors in different studies . in particular, they correspond to the nodes flagged as dubious in ensembl gene trees. we introduce the polytomy refinement problem in section 2, and we show in section 3 how it reduces to a clique decomposition problem in a graph representing speciation and duplication relationships between the leaves of a polytomy. we develop a bounded heuristic in section 4, with guaranteed optimality in well-characterized instances. in section 5 we exhibit a general methodology, using our polytomy refinement algorithm, for correcting nad nodes of a gene tree. we then show in section 6 that this approach is in agreement with the observed corrections of ensembl gene trees from one release to another. to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution non-commercial license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), which permits non-commercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. for commercial re-use, please contact journals.permissions@oup.comsimulated data. simulations are performed as follows. for a given integer n, we generate a species tree s with a random number of leaves between 0:5n and 3n. we then generate a forest f =g 1 ;. .. ; g n of cherries by randomly picking, for each cherry g i 2 f, one node s i 2 s and two leaves, one from each of the two subtrees rooted at s i. any leaf of s is used at most once (possibly by adding leafs to s if required), leading to a set of cherries related through joins of type s or nad. then, for each pair fg i ; g j g with join type nad, we relate them through ad with probability 1/2 (or do nothing with probability 1/2), by adding a duplicated leaf. for each pair s; f , we compared the number of nads found by algorithm minnadref with the minimum number of nads returned by an exact algorithm exploring all possible binary trees that can be constructed from f. we generated a thousand random s and f for each n ! 4. we stopped at n = 14, as the brute-force algorithm is too time-costly beyond this point. over all the explored datasets simulated as described above, algorithm minnadref was able to output an optimal solution, i.e. a refinement with the minimum number of nads. therefore, the examples on which the heuristic fails seem to be rare, and the algorithm performs well on polytomies of reasonable size. we then wanted to assess how the nad minimization criterion differs from the rearrangement cost minimization criterion. we generated 960 random instances with forests of sizes ranging between 5 and 100 (10 instances for each 5 n 100). we a b c d s : g :. a gene tree g and a species tree s, from which we obtain g by pushing x by multifurcation. here, x is a nad, and is pushed by taking the forest of maximal subtrees of g that only have genes from species in the s l subtree (green), then another forest for the s r subtree (red) in the same manner. both these forests are joined under a polytomy, which are then joined under a common parent, so the root of g is a speciation i523the present work is dedicated to the polytomy refinement problem. while the mutation cost of reconciliation has been used previously as an optimization criterion for choosing an appropriate binary tree, here we use an alternative criterion, which is the minimization of nads. the tractability of the minnadref problem remains open, as is the problem to select, among all possible solutions, those leading to a minimum reconciliation cost. although developing a gene tree correction tool is not the purpose of this article, we show how our algorithm for polytomy refinement can be used in this context, by developing a simple algorithm allowing to correct a single nad. this algorithm has been applied to trees of a previous ensembl release, and the corrected trees have been compared with the trees of the current ensembl release. a good correlation between the two sets of trees is observed, which tends to support our correction paradigm. while minimizing nads cannot be a sufficient criterion for gene tree correction, it should rather be seen as one among others, such as statistical , syntenic or based on reconciliation with the species tree , that can be integrated in a methodological framework for gene tree correction.
