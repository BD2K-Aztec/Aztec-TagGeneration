systems biology discovering combinatorial interactions in survival data motivation: although several methods exist to relate high-dimensional gene expression data to various clinical phenotypes, finding combinations of features in such input remains a challenge, particularly when fitting complex statistical models such as those used for survival studies. results: our proposed method builds on existing regularization path-following techniques to produce regression models that can extract arbitrarily complex patterns of input features (such as gene combinations) from large-scale data that relate to a known clinical outcome. through the use of the datas structure and itemset mining techniques, we are able to avoid combinatorial complexity issues typically encountered with such methods, and our algorithm performs in similar orders of duration as single-variable versions. applied to data from various clinical studies of cancer patient survival time, our method was able to produce a number of promising gene-interaction candidates whose tumour-related roles appear confirmed by literature.from their inception, high-dimensional genomic data, such as obtained through genome-wide expression microarrays, have been used to identify genes that affects survival or tumour reoccurrence time spans among cancer patients . survival data generally contain partially known observations (e.g. when clinical follow-up of the patient ends before a decisive event) requiring the use of regression models that can specifically handle censored data. cox proportional hazards model is one such model that combines advantages of both parametric and non-parametric approaches to statistical inference, making it ideally adapted to the type of data obtained in clinical trials. owing to the high dimensionality and small sample size of gene expression data, it is desirable to add a penalization component in fitting the cox model , with 1-norm often preferred for its ability to drive sparsity of the model and select a concise set of variables (gene expression values, mutation types, etc.) . different methods have been suggested (;) for fitting 1-penalized cox model., in particular, proposed a method to compute the regularization path of 1-penalized cox model, producing a series of cox models that have different levels of complexity and sparsity. as for many models in systems biology, it has been widely shown that the gene regulatory pathways of cancer involve non-linear gene interactions. although models based on linear combinations of gene expression may accurately approximate more complex interactions for some tasks, it can be desirable to specifically identify combinatorial covariates for such purpose as the identification of synthetic lethal genes . however, all current methods rely on the ability to enumerate potential input variables: although it is computationally feasible to examine each single gene in such a way (even for a large microarray), issues of exponential complexity quickly arise when considering interactions between more than one gene at a time. in this article, we extend the approach in park and hastie (2007) to handle combinatorial interactions among genes. we deal with issues of combinatorial explosion and computational complexity by taking advantage of itemset mining techniques . using this approach, virtually limitless combinations of genes and phenotypes, grouped in itemsets of boolean variables, can be used as single predictor variables in the model. our proposed algorithm computes the regularization path of 1-penalized cox models that account for the effects of combinatorial gene interactions on survival. beyond proportional hazards models, our itemset-based method can be applied to any regression model with convex loss, each time making use of the inputs structure and sparsity to sidestep complexity issues, while at the same time guaranteeing that events along the regularization path (values of the regularization parameter for which a change occurs in the model structure) are exhaustively explored. to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2013. published by oxford university press.

techniques to work with patterns of discretized input features instead of single continuous values. section 3 details the mathematical basis for our algorithm and illustrates its application to proportional hazard models using coxs partial likelihood as loss function (with further detailed proofs as supplementary material). finally, section 4 presents qualitative and quantitative results obtained by applying our method to different survival datasets.in this article, we presented an algorithm to follow the regularization path of any 1-regularized linear model fitting, using combinatorial interactions as covariates. although the path-following method has been applied to microarray data in the past , it was until now only able to deal with single-valued features, ignoring possible higher-order effect of gene interactions. our method makes uses of existing frequent itemset mining techniques and novel imports from fractional programming to avoid the intractability issues of combinatorial input and produce a regression model of accuracy and run time comparable with the linear case. by running multiple iterations of the algorithm on subsampled datasets, we can produce ordered lists of candidate interactions with strong predicting power. the interactions found by applying our method to cancer study survival data include many genes that could not be found through linear models, yet show up in literature as strongly tied to these conditions, confirming the crucial importance of taking interaction effects into account to detect some of the weaker signal in gene expression data. although most significant interactions found by our method on experimental data were limited to two or three genes, there are no theoretical limitations to the size of interactions that can be searched, at no particularly higher computational cost, setting this method apart from other recent work on penalized selection of interactions in high-dimensional data . the strong noise inherent to gene expression microarray likely prevents the detection of weaker signals between more than three genes, making it an attractive prospect to work with less noisy types of data where larger interactions might be detectable. in the future, we plan to extend our field of application to a wider range of biomedical data, such as the identification of snp interactions , as well as leverage our models ability to deal with heterogeneous input, for example by
