genome analysis bias from removing read duplication in ultra-deep sequencing experiments motivation: identifying subclonal mutations and their implications requires accurate estimation of mutant allele fractions from possibly duplicated sequencing reads. removing duplicate reads assumes that polymerase chain reaction amplification from library constructions is the primary source. the alternativesampling coincidence from dna fragmentationhas not been systematically investigated. results: with sufficiently high-sequencing depth, sampling-induced read duplication is non-negligible, and removing duplicate reads can overcorrect read counts, causing systemic biases in variant allele fraction and copy number variation estimations. minimal overcorrection occurs when duplicate reads are identified accounting for their mate reads, inserts are of a variety of lengths and samples are sequenced in separate batches. we investigate sampling-induced read duplication in deep sequencing data with 500 to 2000 duplicates-removed sequence coverage. we provide a quantitative solution to overcorrec-tion and guidance for effective designs of deep sequencing platforms that facilitate accurate estimation of variant allele fraction and copy number variation. availability and implementation: a python implementation is freely available at

subclonal mutations and estimating their population size can critically affect the clinical diagnosis and therapeutic intervention of individual cancer patients . this realization has led to the rapid development of deep sequencing as a molecular diagnostic platform in cancer clinics . estimating the variant allele fraction (vaf) from somatic samples sheds light on the intrinsic sample heterogeneity that originates from somatic mutations, and hence the etiology of many diseases, particularly cancer . in addition, genomic regions (such as genes or exons) may exist in different numbers of copies due to mutational events such as duplication and deletion. this is referred to as copy number variation. in oncology, comparisons between copy numbers of different genes or between copy numbers of the same gene from different samples (normal versus tumor tissue, for instance) disclose signs of any selective pressure driving tumorigenesis . both tasks can be approached by counting reads from next-generation sequencing (ngs) experiments . in practice, read counting is complicated by amplification bias, namely, the bias as a result of the preference of the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in reproducing reads of different lengths and compositions . removing duplicate readsreads of the same length and sequence identityis a widely used practice to correct this bias when analyzing ngs data . the underlying assumption of this approach is that pcr amplification is responsible for most of the read duplication. extending from this assumption, a long-standing recognition has been held in the community that removing duplicate reads at least does not harm the data. an alternative source of read duplication is sampling coincidence, whereby inserts are fragmented at identical genomic positions during library construction. the practice of removing duplicate reads is well justified only when the sequencing depth is low and sampling coincidence is unlikely. this was true when most ngs applications were of low sequencing depths and were oriented toward uncovering germline mutations from monoclonal samples. however, as recent studies that aim to detect rare somatic mutations from heterogeneous samples have pushed sequencing depth to a high magnitude , the validity of this assumption requires serious re-evaluation. this article provides a quantitative understanding of the source of read duplication by quantifying the read duplication that is induced by sampling coincidence. by providing a statistical formulation for the bias of the allele fraction estimator based on de-duplicated reads, we are led to conclude that at a high sequencing depth, the practice of duplicate read removal can overcorrect amplification bias. from simulations, we show that the extent of overcorrection is jointly determined by the sequencing depth, the variance of the insert size, the strategy to whom correspondence should be addressed.used for marking duplicate reads and intrinsic sequence properties, such as the existence of segregating sites in the neighboring region and the linkage disequilibrium (ld) pattern among sites. to quantify the amount of sampling-induced read duplication, we applied our model and overcorrection amendment method to data from a clinical cancer sequencing platform that produces 500 to 2000 sequence coverage to exons in 202 targeted cancer genes. consistent with the currently applied assumption behind duplicate read removal, we found that pcr amplification, rather than sampling coincidence, is responsible for most read duplication. when duplicate reads are removed, the read depth is not as high as originally designed from the experiment, reflecting an insufficient sample complexity in the experiment. however, for reads that are treated as single-end reads because the corresponding mates cannot be identified ($one-tenth of reads), sampling-induced read duplication is not rare. further, when we artificially mixed different deep sequencing samples to a much higher read depth, we observed more sampling-induced read duplication, as expected. hence, we predict that further increases in sequencing depth or reduction in insert size variation may lead to non-negligible biases that require a method of correction such as what we provide in this article. in the field of rna-seq, where read count is used to estimate transcription level, two recent studies have taken into account natural duplication . this concept is analogous to what we study in this article, albeit studied without systematic investigation of segregating sites or vaf bias. with that in mind, the contribution of this article is 3-fold. first, we call attention to the potential bias in estimating vaf and copy number variation due to overcorrecting read counts in deep dna sequencing (particularly whole exome sequencing for clinical applications). although duplicate read removal does not lead to substantial overcorrection on the datasets we studied, our simulations demonstrate that overcorrection from duplicate read removal could be substantial at smaller insert size variances and higher read depths. second, we provide insights into the design of ultra-deep sequencing experiments such that duplicate read removal is most effective and overcorrection is minimal. third, we propose a practical computational method for estimating the amount of sampling-induced read duplication for evaluating whether a dataset is amenable to de-duplication and for amending the overcorrection. through simulations, we show that our methods can recover the true vaf or copy number variation (up to the extent permitted by the data).removing read duplicates, while correcting for pcr amplification bias, could introduce another bias owing to overcorrection of read counts as a result of sampling-induced read duplication. this bias is of particular concern when the sequencing is deep (e.g. 45000) and the insert size is short and non-variant. a maximum likelihood amendment can be applied to the number of de-duplicated reads to account for sampling-induced read duplication. sampling-induced read duplication in most current ultra-deep sequencing experiments is not prevalent due to the presence of a substantial amount of pcr amplificationoriginated duplicate reads. nevertheless, attention must be paid to duplicate read removal in ultra-deep sequencing experiments that perform fewer rounds of pcr amplification and use tightly selected insert sizes.it has been generally perceived that the accuracy of allele fraction estimation can be infinitely improved by increasing sequencing depth. the practice of duplicate read removal may be a limiting factor for this improvement. this is because when read depth is high, sampling-induced read duplication becomes more common and their removal can disproportionately distort the read count. the overcorrection amendment method introduced in this article alleviates this problem, yet still fails to obtain an accurate estimation of the original read count when the number of unique reads is close to or at saturation (the variance of the maximum likelihood estimator tends to infinity). in fact, as coverage increases, more and more combinations of insert size and cover are saturated. the variance of the haplotype frequency estimation is not reduced as compared with the clear enhancement of the accuracy of the estimation made from raw reads or de-duplicated reads (supplementary). another reason is that the number of unique reads m is constrained to integers. the variance cannot be further reduced as coverage approaches the point where m ! l (saturation; see green dots and boxes in supplementary). in fact, as m reaches a value close to l, em can never be reached. thus one cannot accurately amend the vaf from the estimator p 0 based on one single sequencing experiment. this is again in contrast to the estimator keeping duplicate reads b p i c i =n where varb p i p i 1 p i =n, where the higher the coverage, n, the smaller the variance and hence the more accurate the estimation. the choice of performing duplicate read removal depends on whether the target quantity (e.g. vaf or copy number variation) is distorted (disproportionately amplified) by read duplication. the potential cause for distortion is pcr amplification bias and the bias introduced from removing sampling-induced read duplication. insert size variance is a key player in determining the extent of both forms of biases. data with large variances in insert size are more susceptible to pcr amplification bias but less susceptible to sampling-induced read duplication. for such datasets, duplicate read removal is more appropriate. on the other hand, for data with sharply selected insert sizes, pcr amplification bias is smaller, whereas sampling-induced read duplication is more frequent. in practice, the reported sequencing depth may be misleading as it contains a large proportion (typically 3070) of amplification-induced duplicate reads. these duplicate reads do not help improve the measurement of the sample dna. more specifically, the number of ligated fragments that can eventually be captured by emulsion beads (abi solid and roche 454 sequencing) or by forming clusters on the flow cell lawn (illumina solexa sequencing) is smaller than that of the sequenced reads. for most applications that aim to decipher the vaf or copy number, the more appropriate definition of read depth should exclude pcr amplification-induced duplication. based on such definition, some ultra-deep sequencing datasets may not be as deep as they seem. an important limitation to the true read depth is the amount of sample dna fragmented in the initial stage of the sequencing experiment or the so-called sample complexity. assuming that all sites from the whole genome have equal amounts of dna and no molecule is lost from fragmentation and size selection, the theoretical coverage limit can be calculated by w=ml n a , where w is the weight of the dna to start a sequencing experiment. m 660 10 9 ng=mol=bp is the average molecular weight of dna molecules per base pair. l 3 10 9 bp is the length of the genome and n a is avogadros constant. in deep sequencing experiments, w typically ranges from 200 to 500 ng, meaning that the upperbound of the coverage is from 6 10 4 to 1:5 10 5. this calculation assumes no loss from size selection and ligation, which is unrealistic. if the procedure that includes fragmentation, ligation, size selection and single molecule capturing loses $ 90 of these molecules (which is not unlikely considering the chance of obtaining the desired insert size from random fragmentation),
