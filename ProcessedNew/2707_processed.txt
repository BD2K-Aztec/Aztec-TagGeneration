systems biology libroadrunner: a high performance sbml simulation and analysis library motivation: this article presents libroadrunner, an extensible, high-performance, cross-platform, open-source software library for the simulation and analysis of models expressed using systems biology markup language (sbml). sbml is the most widely used standard for representing dynamic networks, especially biochemical networks. libroadrunner is fast enough to support large-scale problems such as tissue models, studies that require large numbers of repeated runs and interactive simulations. results: libroadrunner is a self-contained library, able to run both as a component inside other tools via its c and c bindings, and interactively through its python interface. its python application programming interface (api) is similar to the apis of matlab (www.mathworks.com) and scipy (http://www.scipy.org/), making it fast and easy to learn. libroadrunner uses a custom just-in-time (jit) compiler built on the widely used llvm jit compiler framework. it compiles sbml-specified models directly into native machine code for a variety of processors, making it appropriate for solving extremely large models or repeated runs. libroadrunner is flexible, supporting the bulk of the sbml specification (except for delay and non-linear algebraic equations) including several sbml extensions (composition and distributions). it offers multiple deterministic and stochastic integrators, as well as tools for steady-state analysis, stability analysis and structural analysis of the stoichiometric matrix. availability and implementation: libroadrunner binary distributions are available for mac os x, linux and windows. the library is licensed under apache license version 2.0. libroadrunner is also available for arm-based computers such as the raspberry pi. http://www.libroadrunner.org provides online documentation, full build instructions, binaries and a git source repository. contacts:dynamic network models of metabolic, gene regulatory, protein-signaling and electrophysiological networks require the specification of components, interactions, compartments and kinetic parameters. the systems biology markup language (sbml) has become the de facto standard for declarative specification of these types of model . popular tools for the development, simulation and analysis of models specified in sbml include copasi , systems biology workbench (sbw) , the systems biology simulation core algorithm (tsbsc) , jarnac , libsbmlsim , soslib , ibiosim , pysces and virtualcell . some of these applications are stand-alone packages designed for interactive use, with limited reusability as components in other applications. few are reusable libraries. currently, none is fast enough to support emerging applications that require largescale simulation of network dynamics. for example, multi-cell virtual-tissue simulations often require simultaneous simulation of tens of thousands of replicas of dynamic network models residing in their cell objects and interacting between cells. in addition, optimization methods require generation of timeseries for tens of thousands of replica networks to explore the highdimensional parameter spaces typical of biochemical networks . we designed libroadrunner to provide: (i) efficient time-series generation and analysis of large or multiple sbml-based models; (ii) a comprehensive and logical application programming interface (api); (iii) interactive simulations in the style of ipython and matlab and (iv) extensibility. most existing sbml simulation engines use built-in interpreters to parse and execute sbml model specifications. interpreted execution is simple and flexible, but much slower than execution of compiled code. other simulation engines generate compiled executables from sbml by first converting sbml-specified models into a general-purpose-language representation. the engines then call an external compiler to translate the general-purpose-language into an executable shared library to load at run time. e.g., sbwroadrunner in the sbw suite converts sbml into c [see 1.4 of (, then compiles the c using the built-in compiler from the .net distribution. this approach generates relatively fast executables. however, it requires distribution of a separate compiler or a redistributable runtime, reducing portability. a more efficient approach to sbml-to-executable compilation uses a specialized just-in-time (jit) compiler, to compile sbml into an optimized intermediate language (il) representation and the il code into native executable machine code directly in-memory.used jit compilation to generate cuda code from sbml and execute it on an nvidia gpu. libroadrunner and the stochastic simulation compiler (ssc) both compile dynamic network-model specifications into executables, ssc focusing on stochastic simulation of rule-based models and libroadrunner on sbml-specified models. libroadrunner supports execution of a broad range of sbml models on cpus using a custom-built jit compiler [based on the llvm jit compiler framework (] which translates sbml into highly optimized executable code for a broad range of processors. llvmbased compilers are small, so all jit operations occur in memory, without external file or compiler access, ensuring fast, self-contained simulations and a relatively small distribution package.
