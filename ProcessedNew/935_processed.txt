bioinformatics discovery note genome analysis characterization of the sos meta-regulon in the human gut microbiome motivation: data from metagenomics projects remain largely untapped for the analysis of transcriptional regulatory networks. here, we provide proof-of-concept that metagenomic data can be effectively leveraged to analyze regulatory networks by characterizing the sos meta-regulon in the human gut microbiome. results: we combine well-established in silico and in vitro techniques to mine the human gut microbiome data and determine the relative composition of the sos network in a natural setting. our analysis highlights the importance of translesion synthesis as a primary function of the sos response. we predict the association of this network with three novel protein clusters involved in cell wall biogenesis, chromosome partitioning and restriction modification, and we confirm binding of the sos response transcriptional repressor to sites in the promoter of a cell wall biogenesis enzyme, a phage integrase and a death-on-curing protein. we discuss the implications of these findings and the potential for this approach for metagenome analysis.the unprecedented coverage provided by next-generation sequencing technologies has enabled direct sequencing of heterogeneous bacterial populations in their natural habitat. metagenomics projects, therefore, offer a unique window into the genetic composition of microbial ecosystems . to date, a substantial amount of work has focused on pathway analysis as a method to analyze and compare metagenomic populations . this approach is particularly suited for reconstructing the multispecies genetic organization of metabolic pathways across a metagenome . in contrast, nonmetabolic transcriptional regulatory networks (trns), such as stress responses, present a different challenge. these networks are typically defined by the functional regulation of their components, rather than by their biochemical interconnections, and their genetic composition can vary significantly across bacteria . hence, the mere presence of a particular gene or set of genes within a metagenomic sample does not imply their belonging to a given trn or the existence of such a network in the sample. membership to a trn can be instead defined by the ability of a regulating transcription factor to bind upstream of and directly regulate an operon . in well-studied bacterial transcription factors, the binding motif is known to be conserved at the class or phylum levels . if the binding motif for the regulating transcription factor is known and can be shown to be conserved for a given subset of the sampled taxa, it is hence theoretically possible to reconstruct its associated composite trn, or metanetwork, at the metagenome level by analyzing sequence data from metagenomic projects. conservation of the binding motif can be assessed through comparative genomics analyses, which can also be used to validate robust multispecies scoring matrices that are well suited for metagenomic analyses . the analysis of regulatory networks at the metagenome level presents several potential advantages over genomic analyses. first, it leverages a large and increasing amount of data for regulatory network analysis. second, it complements a genome-centered perspective by providing a glimpse of the regulatory network organization in its natural environment. finally, it can capture the contribution of uncultured organisms and mobile genetic elements that are poorly represented in genomic data. here, we explore this approach by analyzing the composition of the bacterial sos regulon in the human gut microbiome through in silico and in vitro analyses, providing proof-of-concept for the use of metagenomic data in the inference of regulatory meta-networks. the sos response presents several properties that make it a suitable target to validate this type of analysis. it is a wellstudied, widespread and relatively large network ($40 genes in escherichia coli) aimed primarily at addressing dna damage through the activation of repair enzymes, translesion synthesis polymerases and cell division inhibitors (fernandez de). it is also of clinical relevance due to its implication in virulence, mutagenesis and dissemination of antibiotic resistance through the activation of mobile genetic elements . in addition, it is governed by a repressor (lexa) with a remarkably different distribution in the two clades that constitute bacteroidetes, but it targets a to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. well-defined binding motif in the firmicutes .
