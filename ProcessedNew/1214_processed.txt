structural bioinformatics csb: a python framework for structural bioinformatics computational structural biology toolbox (csb) is a cross-platform python class library for reading, storing and analyzing biomo-lecular structures with rich support for statistical analyses. csb is designed for reusability and extensibility and comes with a clean, well-documented api following good object-oriented engineering practice. availability: stable release packages are available for download from the python package index (pypi) as well as from the projects websitethe python programming language is becoming an increasingly popular choice in research. with its comprehensive numerical libraries and dynamic type system, python facilitates rapid application development. but although rapid prototyping is very practical for experimenting with new techniques or features, systematic use of ad hoc scripting often turns into a burden preventing efficient code reuse. this problem is solved with the use of continuously developed, well-abstracted and tested software libraries. productivity in building solid, reliable and extensible bioinformatics applications could therefore significantly benefit from the practice of using library code. here, we introduce the public release of csb, a python library designed for solving problems in the field of computational structural biology. csb improves over existing libraries such as biopython with its granular, consistent and extensible object model and also provides new features like a comprehensive statistical api and support for new abstractions and file formats. this project is a quickly growing class library for structural bioinformatics, providing clean object-oriented apis for working with biological macromolecular structures, sequences, sequence profiles and fragment libraries, and also a significant amount of statistical modules, including many probability distributions and samplers. we put a strong emphasis on quality and reliability achieved through continuous attention to good software design and best practices in test engineering.structure, chain, residue and atom. the structure class illustrates examples of csbs design philosophy. structure instances are hierarchical objects, implementing the composite pattern. each level in this hierarchy is represented by a class, derived from the base abstractentity. every entity thus exposes a standard set of operations such as abstractentity.transform, which automatically propagate down the tree when invoked at arbitrary level. users are free to define their own, pluggable abstractentity implementations. another aspect of the core library is our i/o api for a broad variety of biological file formats (csb.bio.io). for example, csb.bio.io.hhpred is the first publicly available python module to date for working with hhpreds hmm and result files . another module, csb.bio.io.mrc, implements objects for processing cryo-electron microscopy maps, while csb.bio.io.clans provides i/o for clans . reading and writing pdb files is done using our pdb api, which is part of csb.bio.io.wwpdb. it is worth mentioning that the default pdb parser in csb differs significantly from existing solutions such as biopython. structureparser reads and initializes all residues from seqres (if available), rather than the atom fields in the file. atom records are subsequently mapped to the residue objects using a simple and fast alignment algorithm. therefore, chain objects in csb always contain the complete primary structure of the pdb chain, as defined by the seqres fields. this feature eliminates the need to relate the pdb atoms back to the real sequence of the protein in questiona process which is often difficult and error-prone. when benchmarked over the complete pdb database, our seqres mapping algorithm fails for about 250 structures. this is frequently an indication of a pdb format issue. in this to whom correspondence should be addressed. case, the parser would raise a characteristic exception upon which the client can switch to an atom-based parsing mode. we compared the performance of regularstructureparser with pdb i/o modules from alternative libraries: biopython, pycogent and the c based open structure . as expected, openstructure was the fastest and parsed 4000 pdb entries with 0.09 s per structure. csb is positioned between biopython (0.19 s) and pycogent (0.43 s) with 0.32 s per structure, which suggests that the seqres mapping feature comes with an acceptable performance overhead. our library also hosts a collection of statistical models in the csb.statistics namespace. among these models are standard uniand multivariate probability distributions such as the normal and the gamma distribution and also more exotic distributions such as the multivariate normal inverse gaussian distribution used to model multivariate heavy-tailed data. several estimators based on maximum likelihood and gibbs sampling are implemented. moreover, we provide a general framework for markov chain monte carlo simulation and implementation of standard schemes such as random walk metropolis hastings, hamiltonian monte carlo and replica-exchange monte carlo . methods to analyze monte carlo output are also provided such as, for example, a non-parametric histogram reweighting scheme for the estimation of free energy differences .
