gene expression rbsdesigner: software for designing synthetic ribosome binding sites that yields a desired level of protein expression motivation: rbsdesigner predicts the translation efficiency of existing mrna sequences and designs synthetic ribosome binding sites (rbss) for a given coding sequence (cds) to yield a desired level of protein expression. the program implements the mathematical model for translation initiation described in na et al. (mathematical modeling of translation initiation for the estimation of its efficiency to computationally design mrna sequences with a desired expression level in prokaryotes. bmc syst. biol., 4, 71). the program additionally incorporates the effect on translation efficiency of the spacer length between a shinedalgarno (sd) sequence and an aug codon, which is crucial for the incorporation of fmet-trna into the ribosome. rbsdesigner provides a graphical user interface (gui) for the convenient design of synthetic rbss. availability: rbsdesigner is written in python and microsoft visual basic 6.0 and is publicly available as precompiled stand-alone software on the web (http://rbs.
