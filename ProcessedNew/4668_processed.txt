time and memory efficient likelihood-based tree searches on phylogenomic alignments with missing data motivation: the current molecular data explosion poses new challenges for large-scale phylogenomic analyses that can comprise hundreds or even thousands of genes. a property that characterizes phylogenomic datasets is that they tend to be gappy, i.e. can contain taxa with (many and disparate) missing genes. in current phylogenomic analyses, this type of alignment gappyness that is induced by missing data frequently exceeds 90. we present and implement a generally applicable mechanism that allows for reducing memory footprints of likelihood-based [maximum likelihood (ml) or bayesian] phylogenomic analyses proportional to the amount of missing data in the alignment. we also introduce a set of algorithmic rules to efficiently conduct tree searches via subtree pruning and re-grafting moves using this mechanism. results: on a large phylogenomic dna dataset with 2177 taxa, 68 genes and a gappyness of 90, we achieve a memory footprint reduction from 9 gb down to 1 gb, a speedup for optimizing ml model parameters of 11, and accelerate the subtree pruning regrafting tree search phase by factor 16. thus, our approach can be deployed to improve efficiency for the two most important resources, cpu time and memory, by up to one order of magnitude. availability: current open-source version of raxml v7.2.6 available atin this article, we study the time-and memory-efficient execution of subtree pruning and re-grafting moves for conducting tree searches on gappy phylogenomic multi-gene alignments (also known as super-matrices) under the maximum likelihood (ml,) model by example of raxml . while we use raxml to prove our concept, the mechanisms presented here can easily be integrated into all bayesian-and ml-based programs that conduct tree searches and are hence predominantly limited by the time and space efficiency of likelihood computations on trees. typically, likelihood computations account for 8595 of overall execution time in bayesian and ml programs . moreover, the space required to hold the probability vectors of the likelihood model (the ancestral probability vectors that are assigned to the inner nodes of the tree) also largely dominates the memory consumption of likelihood-based programs. while space and time requirements can be reduced by using the cat approximation of rate heterogeneity and/or single precision instead of double precision floating point arithmetics (berger and stamatakis, to whom correspondence should be addressed.2009;), there exists an urgent need to further improve the computational efficiency of the likelihood function because of the bio gap, i.e., the fact that molecular data accumulates at a faster pace than processor architectures are becoming faster (seein). as bioinformatics is coming off age and because the community is facing unprecedented challenges regarding the scalability and computational efficiency of widely used bioinformatics functions, we believe that work on algorithmic engineering aspects will become increasingly important to ensure the success of the field. the largest published ml-based phylogenomic study in terms of cpu hours and memory requirements already required 2.25 million cpu hours and 15 gb of main memory on an ibm bluegene/l supercomputer . moreover, we are receiving an increasing number of reports by raxml users that intend to conduct phylogenomic analyses on datasets that require up to 181 gb of main memory under the standard model of rate heterogeneity and double precision arithmetics. memory consumption is, therefore, becoming a limiting factor for phylogenomic analyses, especially at the whole-genome scale. initial work by stamatakis and ott (2008b) on methods for efficiently computing the likelihood on phylogenomic alignments with missing data focused on computing the likelihood and optimizing branch lengths on a single, fixed tree topology using pointer meshes. here, we address the conceptually more difficult extension of this approach to likelihood model parameter optimization (for parameters other than branch lengths) and tree searches that entail dynamically changing trees. we describe and make available as open source code, a generally applicable framework to efficiently compute the likelihood on dynamically changing tree topologies during a subtree pruning regrafting (spr)based tree search. search algorithms that rely on spr moves represent the most widely used tree search technique in state-ofthe-art programs for phylogenetic inference. in addition, we implement full ml model parameter optimization under the proposed mechanism and also take advantage of the memory footprint reduction potential that was only mentioned as a theoretical possibility by stamatakis and ott (2008b) without providing an actual implementation.the recursive lookups to search for gene nodes in the pruning branch and insertion branch subtrees are implemented navely, by recursive descents into subtrees. while this is algorithmically not very elegant, the efficiency of this procedure is not critical because a profiling run using gprof on datasets d59_8 and d404_11 revealed that the recursive search procedures account for 1 of total execution time. on d37831_6 the contribution may be higher, but a profiling run could not be conducted because of excessive run-times and the significant slowdown associated with profiling. in table 1, we indicate the execution time speedups between the standard implementation and the mesh-based approach for model parameter optimization (denoted as model optimization) as well as fast lazy (denoted as fast spr) and slow lazy spr searches (denoted as slow spr). overall, speedups for the fast lazy sprs tend to be higher than for the thorough lazy sprs, particularly for protein data. in, we provide the overall execution times in seconds (including file i/o, model optimization, and spr searches) for the mesh-based and standard (denoted as nomesh) likelihood function implementations using the fast and the more thorough lazy spr moves.in table 3, we provide the gappyness of each dataset, i.e. the proportion of entirely missing data per gene over the entire alignment and the memory footprint for inferences under gtr+ and wag+ for the mesh-based and standard approach. the memory savings are roughly proportional to the degree of gappyness. finally, inwe depict the likelihood scores of the trees computed independently by optimizing the likelihood score on the resulting spr-modified trees obtained by the mesh-based and standard method. the scores on the trees were optimized using the mesh-based approach to save time, but for the smaller datasets we also conducted a tree evaluation using the standard approach. as already mentioned, likelihood scores may be slightly different if model parameters are optimized using the standard approach because of numerical deviations. it is interesting to observe that for thorough lazy spr moves, the mesh-based approach yields slightly better likelihood scores on dataset d2177_68 and d94_1487. this can be attributed to numerical error propagation, because under the standard approach a significantly larger number of computations is conducted that may introduce rounding errors.
