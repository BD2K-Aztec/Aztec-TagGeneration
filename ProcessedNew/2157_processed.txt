systems biology hammer: automated operation of mass frontier to construct in silico mass spectral fragmentation libraries experimental ms n mass spectral libraries currently do not adequately cover chemical space. this limits the robust annotation of metabolites in metabolomics studies of complex biological samples. in silico fragmentation libraries would improve the identification of compounds from experimental multistage fragmentation data when experimental reference data are unavailable. here, we present a freely available software package to automatically control mass frontier software to construct in silico mass spectral libraries and to perform spectral matching. based on two case studies, we have demonstrated that high-throughput automation of mass frontier allows researchers to generate in silico mass spectral libraries in an automated and high-throughput fashion with little or no human intervention required. availability and implementation: documentation, examples, results and source code are available atmass spectrometry (ms)-based metabolomics is a rapidly developing field that aims to detect and measure a variety of small biological molecules (metabolites) over a wide dynamic range . although thousands of metabolites are typically detected in an untargeted metabolomics study of a biological sample, their subsequent identification represents the most significant bottleneck in the discovery of new biochemical knowledge . in many cases, multiple empirical formulae and/or putative chemical structures are reported for each observed mass feature (or more strictly mass-to-charge ratio, m/z). multistage (ms n ) mass spectrometry, which is an experimental technique to collect in-depth fragmentation data related to the chemical structure of metabolites, is often applied to increase accuracy and specificity in metabolite annotation and identification. however, experimental ms n mass spectral libraries currently do not adequately cover the search space for all metabolites present in complex biological samples, as authentic chemical standards are not available for all metabolites. the generation of in silico ms n libraries is anticipated to greatly improve the success rate of annotation of metabolites detected in metabolomics studies, when experimentally acquired ms n data of authentic chemical standards are unavailable. commercial software packages such as mass frontier and acd/ms fragmenter predict in silico fragmentation patterns to assist the interpretation of experimental ms n data . additionally, a freely available tool named metfrag has been developed previously . this tool selects candidate structures from a compound library based on the molecular ion m/z and generates in silico substructures to subsequently annotate fragment peaks. metfrag does not provide the ability to create in silico patterns or libraries independent of the use of experimental data; however, it has been proven to be an efficient approach to annotate fragmentation mass spectra derived from ms experiments. mass frontier is a well-known software package that has been used by more than a thousand academic institutions and companies throughout the world for the management, evaluation and interpretation of mass spectra. it includes three resources that assist the user to robustly predict in silico fragmentation patterns: a set of general fragmentation rules, a fragmentation library comprising 150 000 fragmentation mechanisms collected from the scientific literature and user-specified mechanisms. however, mass frontier cannot readily perform batch processing on the scale required to generate comprehensive in silico libraries for thousands of metabolites. here, we present a freely available software package, named hammer (high-throughput automation of mass frontier), to automatically control mass frontier software to perform in silico fragmentation in an automated and high-throughput matter. this package allows the user to readily generate to whom correspondence should be addressed.
