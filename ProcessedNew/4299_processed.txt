genome analysis smashcommunity: a metagenomic annotation and analysis tool smashcommunity is a stand-alone metagenomic annotation and analysis pipeline suitable for data from sanger and 454 sequencing technologies. it supports state-of-the-art software for essential metagenomic tasks such as assembly and gene prediction. it provides tools to estimate the quantitative phylogenetic and functional compositions of metagenomes, to compare compositions of multiple metagenomes and to produce intuitive visual representations of such analyses. availability: smashcommunity source code and documentation are available atmetagenomics allows the culture-free characterization of natural and host-associated microbial communities and provides an understanding of their structure, dynamics and functionality as well as the environmental factors that shape them . although the volume of metagenomic data being deposited to public repositories is increasing exponentially and more large-scale studies are underway , there are still no standards for experimental and computational methods required to analyze such datasets , making it hard to compare results from these studies. web-servers such as camera , img/m and mg-rast host published metagenomic datasets and enable users to perform additional and comparative analysis on them. however, there is an imminent need for stand-alone computational pipelines that enable in-house analysis of new metagenomic datasets using standardized methods and comparison of datasets from different environments. mg-rast and the megan stand-alone tool perform functional and phylogenetic analyses of metagenomes. however, they do not estimate quantitative abundances as they simply count the reads mapping to known genes or speciesa measure strongly affected by gene length and genome size. they also do not assemble metagenomic reads and are thus unable to identify
