using association rule mining to determine promising secondary phenotyping hypotheses motivation: large-scale phenotyping projects such as the sanger mouse genetics project are ongoing efforts to help identify the influences of genes and their modification on phenotypes. genepheno-type relations are crucial to the improvement of our understanding of human heritable diseases as well as the development of drugs. however, given that there are $20 000 genes in higher vertebrate gen-omes and the experimental verification of genephenotype relations requires a lot of resources, methods are needed that determine good candidates for testing. results: in this study, we applied an association rule mining approach to the identification of promising secondary phenotype candidates. the predictions rely on a large genephenotype annotation set that is used to find occurrence patterns of phenotypes. applying an association rule mining approach, we could identify 1967 secondary phenotype hypotheses that cover 244 genes and 136 phenotypes. using two automated and one manual evaluation strategies, we demonstrate that the secondary phenotype candidates possess biological relevance to the genes they are predicted for. from the results we conclude that the predicted secondary phenotypes constitute good candidates to be experimentally tested and confirmed. availability: the secondary phenotype candidates can be browsed through ata causative gene has not yet been identified for almost half of the existing human heritable diseases . without the knowledge of the molecular basis of a disease, treatment possibilities are limited to treating symptoms instead of curing the underlying defects. in order to be able to find cures and prevention mechanisms for human genetic disorders, we need to comprehensively understand how each disease originates and progresses over time. a collection of human diseases together with confirmed and speculative causes is available from resources such as the online mendelian inheritance in man (omim) or orphanet database. in the quest for identifying causative genes for human genetic disorders, model organisms have gained increasing importance due to the opportunities arising from targeted gene modifications. for example, the mouse shares 99 of genes with humans, and gene modifications leading to phenotypes characteristic for a disease may offer clues to the origins of this disease . experimental results of mutagenesis experiments are stored in species-specific model organism database (mod)s , e.g. the sanger mouse genetics project (sanger-mgp) , wormbase , the mouse genome database (mgd) or flybase . the sanger-mgp is part of the international mouse phenotyping consortium (impc) project that aims to identify the phenotypic implications of 20 000 genes by 2021 . in the framework of this project genetically modified mouse models are assessed according to 20 pre-defined standard operating procedures (sops) that are linked to measurable physical parameters to ascertain the implications of genetic mutations on phenotypes . an example of a sop is the assessment of the grip strength of mice at the age of 9 weeks to assess their neuromuscular function as muscle strength (https://www.mousephenotype.org/impress/protocol/ 83/7). mammalian phenotype ontology (mp) annotations are assigned using a reference range method followed by an expert review. later studies explore the application of other statistical methods to assign mp phenotype annotations based on the obtained parameter readings , however, these methods only cover a subset of the phenotypes covered by the 20 sops. the process of assessing physical measurements in accordance with the 20 pre-defined sops is referred to as primary phenotyping . according to the european mouse disease clinic (eumodic) web page (http://www.eumodic.org/) a distributed network of centres with in depth expertise in a number of phenotyping domains will undertake more complex, secondary phenotyping screens and apply them to a subset of the mice which have shown interesting phenotypes in the primary screen. . however, with the increasing amount of genes being assessed in the primary phenotyping screen, a manual investigation for interesting results from the primary screens becomes impossible. in addition, the manual assessment of experimental results is time consuming, expensive and requires trained biologists. therefore, automated methods enabling the search for promising secondary phenotypes are needed to complement the results obtained from the primary screens. existing automated solutions include the prediction of phenotypes based on orthologous genes as well as functional annotations of genes to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution non-commercial

do not always provide reliable answers. a solution relying only on existing phenotype annotations could overcome the problem in differing gene function and resulting phenotypes across different species. to the best of our knowledge, the prediction of secondary phenotypes from primary screen annotations in combination with literature-curated phenotypes in mouse has not been addressed before. here, we present an association rule mining approach that enables the identification of potential secondary phenotype screens in mouse using data from mgd, and complementing the primary phenotype screens in sanger-mgp. applying association rule mining, we were able to discover 188 rules, covering 242 phenotypes and leading to 1967 predictions for secondary phenotypes for 244 genes contained in the sanger-mgp database. these 1967 suggested genephenotype associations include 136 unique phenotypes for which new assays can be defined for. the predicted associations are neither contained in mgd nor sanger-mgp. we automatically as well as manually evaluated the secondary phenotype predictions and can demonstrate that our results show viable candidates. in conclusion, we believe that novel biological hypotheses and secondary phenotype screens can be formulated from the predicted secondary phenotypes.illustrates the overall workflow of this study. the following subsections describe the prediction approach and the utilized datasets in detail.applying association rule mining, we were able to identify 188 rules (provided in supplementary material s1) that lead to secondary phenotype hypotheses for 244 sanger-mgp genes. in total, we could predict 1967 novel genephenotype associations containing 136 unique phenotypes that are not contained in mgd. out of these 1967 genephenotype relationships, 47 were covered by the taxonomy of the ontology, i.e. the predicted phenotypes were ancestor concepts of annotations already used for one particular gene. the 136 unique phenotype concepts span 23 of mgds 30 top level phenotypes, such as tumorigenesis (mp:0002006), nervous system phenotype (mp:0003631) or muscle phenotype (mp:0005369), showing the diversity of phenotypes that could be added to the annotation of genes. the 136 phenotypes also cover different hierarchy levels in the ontology spanning from the second to the 11th level, with the highest group falling into level 6 (all measured as shortest distance from the root node of the mp ontology). for example, adenohypophysis hypoplasia (mp:0008365) as well as abnormal cranium size (mp:0010031) are suggested as secondary phenotypes. in general, the deeper an ontology term is the more specific is the concept it is representing. this means that the predictions not only span a variety of different high level phenotypes but also add detailed information to the genes they are associated with which allows for a better characterization of individual genes. supplementary material s1 provides all the predicted secondary phenotype annotations together with additional information such as the high level phenotype, term name and frequency of occurrence in the prediction dataset.in this study, we applied an association rule mining approach to mine secondary phenotypes and computationally verify their biological validity using two automated and a limited manual evaluation. we used the manually assigned phenotype annotations contained in mgd for learning phenotype co-occurrence patterns and merged the identified patterns with phenotypes that were experimentally verified in primary screens and are available from the sanger-mgp . using data from particular resources creates dependencies towards those data resources. for example, annotation guidelines such as those employed by mgd ensure a consistency of human annotators but can also create artefacts in the predictions generated from the data. in our particular case, we may find phenotype co-occurrence patterns that are intrinsic to annotation guidelines and not purely due to their co-occurrence. this may occur when the annotation guidelines cover rules that enforce a set of phenotypes to be annotated in particular circumstances instead of only one. however, as these guidelines exist to ensure biological correctness of the data, we expect that those cases still constitute biologically interesting, though known connections between individual phenotypes. the implementation of the secondary phenotype prediction pipeline relies solely on an association rule mining approach. using the pipeline in conjunction with 7027 unique phenotypes (see section 2.1), the obtained result of 188 new rules seems comparatively small. as the number of rules is directly related to the settings for the apriori software, the number of potential hypotheses may be increased by changing these parameters. however, and as with any prediction tool, we applied conservative measures that would reduce the likelihood of creating false hypotheses. in addition, starting with a small subset of rules enables better verification possibilities and selection mechanisms for biological experiment design. potential areas of extension are the incorporation of additional pattern recognition methods that could then be used to form a support system and provide provenance for identified patterns, e.g. only predictions that are made by a number of systems are more likely to be secondary phenotypes. using phenotype patterns to generate secondary phenotype predictions implies that phenotypes that co-occur often with each other, are likely to always co-occur. for some biological phenomena this assumption has been validated, e.g. the correlation of body weight with bone density or blood calcium levels . given that the secondary phenotypes perform well in the evaluation, we feel that the assumption can still be used for forming secondary phenotype hypotheses. however, in future work we envisage a more complex filtering strategy for assigning phenotype annotations using not only primary phenotypes, but also gene function annotations and diseaseautomatically generating secondary phenotyping hypotheses involvement to reduce the number of falsely associated genes and phenotypes in addition to voting from different prediction algorithms.
