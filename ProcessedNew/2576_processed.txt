bioinformatics message from the iscb iscb: pastâ€“present perspective for the international society for computational biology since its establishment in 1997, international society for computational biology (iscb) has contributed importantly toward advancing the understanding of living systems through computation. the iscb represents nearly 3000 members working in 470 countries. it has doubled the number of members since 2007. at the same time, the number of meetings organized by the iscb has increased from two in 2007 to eight in 2013, and the society has cemented many lasting alliances with regional societies and specialist groups. iscb is ready to grow into a challenging and promising future. the progress over the past 7 years has resulted from the vision, and possibly more importantly , the passion and hard working dedication of many individuals. beginning the year 1993: the dawn of the internet; gopher with bookmark lists instead of google; the first public servers for molecular biology have popped up (henikoff, 1993) and with it the dawn of a new era: the explosion of computational biology and bioinfor-matics. larry hunter, russ altman and others shared a vision to bring biology into computer sciences and vice versa and organized the first intelligent systems for molecular biology (ismb) meeting.
