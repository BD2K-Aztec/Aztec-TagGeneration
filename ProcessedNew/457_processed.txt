a profile-based method for identifying func-tional divergence of orthologous genes in bac-terial genomes motivation: next generation sequencing technologies have provided us with a wealth of information on genetic variation, but predicting the functional significance of this variation is a difficult task. while many comparative genomics studies have focused on gene flux and large scale changes, relatively little attention has been paid to quantifying the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms and indels on protein function, particularly in bacterial genomics. results: we present a hidden markov model based approach we call delta-bitscore (dbs) for identifying orthologous proteins that have diverged at the amino acid sequence level in a way that is likely to impact biological function. we benchmark this approach with several widely used datasets and apply it to a proof-of-concept study of orthologous proteomes in an investigation of host adaptation in salmonella enterica. we highlight the value of the method in identifying functional divergence of genes, and suggest that this tool may be a better approach than the commonly used dn/ds metric for identifying functionally significant genetic changes occurring in recently diverged organisms.genome sequencing technologies allow us to explore the wealth of genetic variation between and within species, and as these technologies advance this data is becoming progressively cheaper, faster, and easier to produce . however, analysis of the functional impact of genetic variation has lagged behind, and has largely focused on the presence or absence of macroscopic features such as particular genes, genomic islands, or plasmids. comparative sequence analyses have become common, and exploration of genetic variation between closely-related organisms has provided key insights into bacterial evolution . in particular, the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) has been a tremendous boon to the study of bacterial populations, allowing for the construction of phylogenetic trees which provide information on disease transmission and adaptation at scales ranging from global pandemics to outbreaks within single hospital wards . still, the functional analysis of these snps, insertions, and associate editor: dr. inanc birol the author(s) 2016. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. deletions within protein sequences remains difficult, and often relies on inappropriate tools such as dn/ds. how then can the significance of fine-scale genetic variation be quantified and prioritized for investigation? recent studies have shown that even single snps can have dramatic effects on major phenotypes such as host tropism . studies of pathogen adaptation, for example the adaptation of pseudomonas aeruginosa to the cystic fibrosis lung or of salmonella enterica to immunocompromised populations , often result in findings of hundreds to thousands of snps and small indels in coding regions. genome-wide association studies provide one method for interpreting this variation, however the clonal nature of many pathogens can make such study designs difficult if not impossible to pursue and require large sample sizes to be effective. the development of fast and accurate ways to assess the functional impact of variation between strains and prioritize coding variants for follow-up work is an important step in extracting meaning from comparative analyses.our strategy uses a profile hmm-based approach. profile hmms are probabilistic models of multiple sequence alignments. for each column in the alignment they capture information on the expected frequency of occurrence of different amino acids, insertions, and deletions. we can then use this information to compute a score, which we call deltabitscore (dbs) for reasons explained below, that quantifies the divergence of two protein sequences with respect to the conservation patterns captured by the profile hmm. our key assumption in this is that variation in positions conserved across a protein family are more likely to affect protein function than variation in less conserved positions. similar assumptions have had success in a number of applications such as the prediction of trna pseudogenes and protein folds . our approach is unique in both the simplicity of the measure used, and its flexibility, making it well suited to comparative genomic applications. we demonstrate that our method is effective using several commonly used protein mutagenesis datasets, particularly when used with automatically constructed protein alignments. we provide an example of a comparative genomic analysis, by applying our approach to a whole proteome analysis of a well-studied case of host adaptation in salmonella enterica serovars enteritidis and gallinarum, using a purpose built collection of hmms. we additionally show these results generalize to other host-adapted salmonellae. finally, we compare our method to a popular estimate of selection, dn/ds, and find that the two measures are only weakly correlated. this adds to the evidence that dn/ds is not an appropriate measure for inferring selection for gene function within bacterial populations.we have described a surprisingly simple method for identifying functional divergence in orthologous proteins, including analysis of both point mutations and indel events. despite the simplicity of the dbs measure, its accuracy is similar to state-of-the-art methods for predicting the functional impact of sequence variants. while curated pfam models were less sensitive, they have a high specificity at conservative scoring thresholds (see supplementary, supplementary). the workflow for using such models is simpler (see supplementary), and may be more appropriate for investigations where a low falsepositive rate is more important than detection of all loss-of-function mutations. in addition, while construction of custom models can be timeconsuming to run on a desktop computer, pfam annotation can be performed rapidly. because other methods for estimating the impact of sequence variation, such as sift, provean and mutationassessor, require the user to specify mutations individually, broad scale comparative proteome analysis such as this is difficult and time-intensive to perform, and not all methods are able to score indels or more than one mutation in the same sequence. both dbs approaches scale to whole proteome analysis with minimal user involvement (see github page for pipelines), and were able to detect additional loss of function mutations that were missed by previous studies focused on protein truncations and frameshifts.
