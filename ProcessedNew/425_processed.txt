a poisson model for random multigraphs motivation: biological networks are often modeled by random graphs. a better modeling vehicle is a multigraph where each pair of nodes is connected by a poisson number of edges. in the current model, the mean number of edges equals the product of two propensities, one for each node. in this context it is possible to construct a simple and effective algorithm for rapid maximum likelihood estimation of all propensities. given estimated propensities, it is then possible to test statistically for functionally connected nodes that show an excess of observed edges over expected edges. the model extends readily to directed multigraphs. here, propensities are replaced by outgoing and incoming propensities. results: the theory is applied to real data on neuronal connections, interacting genes in radiation hybrids, interacting proteins in a literature curated database, and letter and word pairs in seven shaskespearean plays. availability: all data used are fully available online from their respective sites. source code and software is available fromrandom graph theory has proved vital in modeling the internet and constructing biological and social networks. in the original formulation of the theory by), there are three key assumptions: (a) a graph exhibits at most one edge between any two nodes; (b) the formation of a given edge is independent of the formation of other edges; and (c) all edges form with the same probability. there is a general agreement that this simple model is too rigid to capture many real-world networks . the surveys summarize some of the elaborations and applications of two generations of scholars, with emphasis on power laws, phase transitions and scale-free networks. in the current article, we study a multigraph to whom correspondence should be addressed. extension of the erdsrnyi model appropriate for very large networks. our model specifically relaxes assumptions (a) and (c). with appropriate alternative assumptions in place, we derive and illustrate a novel maximum likelihood algorithm for estimation of the model parameters. with these parameters in hand, we are then able to find statistically significant connections between pairs of nodes. in practice many graphs are derived from multigraphs. to simplify analysis, the multiple edges between two nodes of a multigraph are collapsed to a single edge. the movie star example in reference is typical. in the movie star graph, two actors are connected by an edge when they appear in the same movie. some actor pairs will appear in a movie mostly by chance. other actor pairs will be connected by multiple edges because they are intrinsically linked. classic pairs such as abbot and costello, loy and powell, and lewis and martin come to mind. the well-studied neural network of caernorhabditis elegans is a prime biological example. here neuron pairs are connected by multiple synapses. because collapsing edges wastes information, it is better to tackle the multiplicity issue directly. thus, we will deal with random multigraphs. for our purposes, these exclude loops and fractional edge weights. instead of a bernoulli number of edges between any two nodes as in the erds and rnyi model, we postulate a poisson number of edges. this choice can be viewed as unnecessarily restrictive, but it is worth recalling that a poisson distribution can approximate a binomial or normal distribution. furthermore, the poisson assumption allows an arbitrary mean number of edges. in relaxing assumption (c) above, we want to introduce as few parameters as possible but still capture the capacity of some nodes to serve as hubs. thus, we assign to each node i a propensity p i to form edges. the random number of edges x ij between nodes i and j is then taken to be poisson distributed with mean p i p j. node pairs with high propensities will have many edges, pairs with low propensities will have few edges, and pairs with one high and one low propensity will have intermediate numbers of edges. later, we will show that these choices promote simple and rapid estimation of the propensities. another virtue of the model is that it generalizes to directed graphs where arcs replace edges. for directed graphs, we postulate an outgoing propensity p i and an incoming propensity q i for each node i. the number of arcs x ij from i to j is taken to be poisson distributed with mean p i q j. in the directed version of the model, the two random variables x ij and x ji are distinguished. in accord with assumption (b), the random counts x ij in either model are taken to be independent.
