using 2k 1 2 bubble searches to find single nucleotide polymorphisms in k-mer graphs motivation: single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) discovery is an important preliminary for understanding genetic variation. with current sequencing methods, we can sample genomes comprehensively. snps are found by aligning sequence reads against longer assembled references. de bruijn graphs are efficient data structures that can deal with the vast amount of data from modern technologies. recent work has shown that the topology of these graphs captures enough information to allow the detection and characterization of genetic variants, offering an alternative to alignment-based methods. such methods rely on depth-first walks of the graph to identify closing bifurcations. these methods are conservative or generate many false-positive results, particularly when traversing highly interconnected (complex) regions of the graph or in regions of very high coverage. results: we devised an algorithm that calls snps in converted de bruijn graphs by enumerating 2k 2 cycles. we evaluated the accuracy of predicted snps by comparison with snp lists from alignment-based methods. we tested accuracy of the snp calling using sequence data from 16 ecotypes of arabidopsis thaliana and found that accuracy was high. we found that snp calling was even across the genome and genomic feature types. using sequence-based attributes of the graph to train a decision tree allowed us to increase accuracy of snp calls further. together these results indicate that our algorithm is capable of finding snps accurately in complex sub-graphs and potentially comprehensively from whole genome graphs.single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) between genomes of individuals are valuable markers for tracing the genetic basis of inheritable traits or diseases. rapid detection and creation of large libraries of snps is vital for timely investigation and identification of genes associated with important phenotypes. contemporary sequencing technology can sample genomes comprehensively in only hours, with these data snp detection is typically achieved by aligning reads to a reference genome and identifying snps as a difference between consensus and the reference . factors such as the need for a reference sequence and the assumption of a monomorphic sample mean that the consensus approach is limited in organisms for which we lack a reference genome, in outbred diploid samples, bulked population data or analysis of v c the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.the 2k 2 algorithm takes a graph theoretical approach to identifying topological structures, namely 2k 2 cycles in undirected graphs that can represent snps in sequences input to a donor de bruijn graph. we have shown that 2k 2 can be used to generate sets of snps in graphs at high accuracy in the a.thaliana genome which is increased by application of the decision tree classifier. 2k 2 found snps across all portions of the a.thaliana genome without bias towards feature type or region. we did not find that all snps seen in alignment-based methods using a reference could be detected with this algorithm and in all our experiments, we found that around 70 of snps seen by alignment could be predicted. the 2k 2 strategy is, therefore, a useful algorithm that should find general use in reference-free snp calling strategies in the future.
