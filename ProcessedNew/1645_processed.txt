genome analysis eugene-pp: a next-generation automated annotation pipeline for prokaryotic genomes it is now easy and increasingly usual to produce oriented rna-seq data as a prokaryotic genome is being sequenced. however, this information is usually just used for expression quantifi-cation. eugene-pp is a fully automated pipeline for structural annotation of prokaryotic genomes integrating protein similarities, statistical information and any oriented expression information (rna-seq or tiling arrays) through a variety of file formats to produce a qualitatively enriched annotation including coding regions but also (possibly anti-sense) non-coding genes and transcription start sites. availability and implementation: eugene-pp is an open-source software based on eugene-p integrating a galaxyprokaryotic genome sequencing and expression quantification using rna-seq or tiling arrays are becoming routine. however, existing prokaryotic gene finders are either ab initio gene finders that identify only coding regions or purely rna-seq-based gene finders predicting transcripts and are much less effective than their ab initio competitors for coding dna sequence (cds) prediction . reconciling conflicting predictions is a tedious work, which is incompatible with the growing prokaryotic genome sequencing rate. there is a need for new prokaryotic gene finders that would directly integrate all available information to produce an enriched and precise structural annotation identifying cds but also (possibly antisense) non-coding genes and transcription start sites (tsss), avoiding tedious reconciliation. we have shown inthat this can be accomplished by finely adapting conditional random field-based integrative eukaryotic gene finding technology to prokaryotic specificities (overlapping genes, operons). the resulting software, eugene-p, simultaneously exploits statistical properties of sequences, existing annotations, similarities to proteins and oriented rna-seq data to produce an enriched annotation with a better delineation of functional genomic elements, and therefore improved expression quantification.
