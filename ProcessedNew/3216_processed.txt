systems biology netbiov: an r package for visualizing large network data in biology and medicine netbiov (network biology visualization) is an r package that allows the visualization of large network data in biology and medicine. the purpose of netbiov is to enable an organized and reproducible visualization of networks by emphasizing or highlighting specific structural properties that are of biological relevance. availability and implementation: netbiov is freely available for academic use. themodern research in the biological and biomedical sciences is driven by technological progress that routinely allows interrogating genetic or molecular entities on a genomic scale. for the analysis and interpretation of high-throughput genomics experiments, frequently networks are used because they enable a systems approach. however, the graphical representation of networks for reasons of their exploratory analysis, interpretation or merely as a visualization is far from being trivial, especially for large networks containing hundreds or thousands of genes. for this reason, several software visualization tools have been developed. in the supplementary file, we compared our visualization software netbiov with cytoscape, visant and yed . in summary, netbiov is fully integrated into r, the gold standard in the computational biology community, and hence can use all of its functionality for user-specific expansions. furthermore, netbiov provides (i) global, (ii) module, (iii) information flow and (iv) hierarchical layout styles, discussed in the following, not available in this form in other packages. importantly, the provided layout styles run efficiently, even for large networks.
