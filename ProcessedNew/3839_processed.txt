structural bioinformatics quantitative method for the assignment of hinge and shear mechanism in protein domain movements motivation: a popular method for classification of protein domain movements apportions them into two main types: those with a hinge mechanism and those with a shear mechanism. the intuitive assignment of domain movements to these classes has limited the number of domain movements that can be classified in this way. furthermore, whether intended or not, the term shear is often interpreted to mean a relative translation of the domains. results: numbers of occurrences of four different types of residue contact changes between domains were optimally combined by logistic regression using the training set of domain movements intuitively classified as hinge and shear to produce a predictor for hinge and shear. this predictor was applied to give a 10-fold increase in the number of examples over the number previously available with a high degree of precision. it is shown that overall a relative translation of domains is rare, and that there is no difference between hinge and shear mechanisms in this respect. however, the shear set contains significantly more examples of domains having a relative twisting movement than the hinge set. the angle of rotation is also shown to be a good discriminator between the two mechanisms. availability and implementation: results are free to browse atmulti-domain proteins can be regarded as comprising quasiglobular regions connected by linkers that allow their relative movement. consequently, domain movements are often engaged in protein function in a wide variety of contexts, including catalysis, transport, signaling and immune response . in many of these cases, domain movements occur on the binding of a ligand. for example, in multi-domain enzymes, the binding of the substrate in the interdomain cleft causes the domains to close trapping the substrate in the specific environment necessary for catalysis. well-known examples include citrate synthase , liver alcohol dehydrogenase and f1-atpase b subunit . experimentally determined information on protein domain movements at the atomic level comes from the structures of proteins in different states solved primarily by x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. these different states may relate to function when they are within the functional cycle, but they may also be due to differences in the experimental conditions under which the structures were solved, or could be due to natural or engineered mutations. these structures, deposited in the protein data bank (pdb) , are a rich source of information on protein domain movements. thus, multiple structures of proteins have been used to analyse and classify domain movements in a number of studies over the past 20 years . the concepts of hinge and shear mechanisms in domain movements were first described byin their influential review article. subsequently, the database of macromolecular movements (dbmm) appeared online with further examples . hinge motions were described as those where the domains approach each other perpendicular to the plane of the interface. shear movements, in contrast, have a preserved domain interface where the domains have a relative movement along the plane of the interface. hinge movements would allow for large relative movement of the domains, whereas shear movements would be limited by the preserved side-chain packing at the interface. although few details were given, it seems that these assignments were made intuitively, probably using molecular graphics software to compare the open and closed structures. this approach obviously limits the number of cases that can be classified in this way, and is also open to criticism in that it is not reproducible. despite these limitations, the fact remains that, for some proteins, domain closure occurs through a simple pacman openingclosing movement, whereas for others the movement is more complex with the two domains remaining in contact during the domain movement. to investigate this further, one would need to develop an automatic method for assigning hinge and shear that uses quantitative and reproducible methods. with this method, one would be able to classify a much larger number of domain movements allowing the further investigation of these two types of mechanisms. to do this, quantities are required that capture the essential difference between hinge and shear movements. the descriptions used in the articles that to whom correspondence

shear movements point to two alternative approaches: one based on the relationship between the domain interface and the movement, the other based on residue contact changes (e.g. via interdigitating sidechains, or newly established contacts, see). in this article, we have taken the latter approach. in our previous work , changes in interdomain residue contacts that occur in the domain movement were used to define four types of elemental contact changes: maintained, exchanged partner, exchanged pair and new. a maintained contact change is where the same pair of residues is found to be in contact in both conformations. an exchangedpartner contact change is one where the same residue is found to be in contact with two different residues in the two conformations, as would occur in a sliding movement. an exchangedpair contact change is one where the residue contact pair in one conformation and the residue contact pair in the other conformation have no residues in common, as would occur in a see-saw movement. a new contact change is one where there is a contact pair in one conformation but no contact pair in the other conformation and might occur in an open to closed domain movement. counting the number of instances of each elemental contact-change type is non-trivial, but a solution was found by the use of so-called dynamic contact graphs . if a domain movement is predominantly shear, one would expect it to have a relatively large number of either maintained or exchanged-partner contact changes, whereas if a domain movement is predominantly hinge, then one would expect it to have a relatively large number of exchanged-pair or new contact changes. here machine learning is used, which uses the number of instances of each of these four types of contact changes for each domain movement to learn from the dbmm to make hinge and shear assignments optimally. the movements in a much larger dataset can then be assigned to hinge and shear categories automatically. in a sense, this approach has allowed us to extract some essence of the subjective approach used to assign hinge and shear movements in the dbmm so that these assignments can be made to a larger dataset. the language, and the figure used in the review article byto depict the shear movement, appears to have led to an interpretation of a shear movement to mean a relative translational movement of the domains, i.e. there is little or no rotational movement involved.illustrates hinge and shear movements based on the figure and descriptions given in the review article . a similar figure has appeared in a review article on protein flexibility and drug design . one might wonder why it is important to make a distinction between a rotational motion and a translational motion in the context of protein domain motions. the key point is that rotations will be locally controlled at specific hinge sites, whereas a translational motion would not be controlled at specific sites. sites where control over a functional movement is exercised are potential target sites for therapeutic molecules. for example, a drug molecule binding to a single hinge site in an enzyme might prevent domain closure and subsequent catalysis of the natural substrate occurring just as effectively as an inhibitor that binds to the active site. the assignment of a domain movement as occurring via a translation would seem to preclude it from this form of alternative drug-site targeting.the concept of hinge and shear mechanisms in domain movements was introduced nearly 20 years ago. assignments of domain movements to these mechanisms were made by an intuitive method that is necessarily subjective. this has limited its application to a small number of domain movements. in the past 20 years, the pdb has grown 30-fold in size and with it the number of implied domain movements. the nrdpdm database contains 2035 unique domain movements, and it would be an onerous task to analyse all of these conformational pairs using molecular graphics software, for the purpose of assigning hinge and shear mechanisms. therefore, an objective, quantitative method that can be implemented computationally for rapid assignment is needed. the difficulty in achieving this lies in the translation of a subjective method to a quantitative method. there are two pieces of information we can use for this purpose: the description of the subjective method used, and the actual assignments themselves. the description suggested that quantities based on the number of instances in each of the four types of residue contact changes from our previous work could be used in distinguishing between preserved interfaces and interface creation. the assignments themselves were used as training data to combine these quantities using logistic regression so as to optimally reproduce the original assignments. the results suggest that we have indeed succeeded in creating a quantitative method for computational assignment of hinge and shear mechanisms. using this approach, we have managed to classify a much larger set of domain movements into hinge and shear resulting in a 10-fold increase in the number of examples over the number previously available with a high degree of precision. the term shear and the figures used to illustrate the shear mechanism have led many to interpret a domain closure to occur via a relative translation of one domain relative to the other. although this is possible, our results have shown that this is rare overall, and no more likely to occur among the shear set than the hinge set. we suggest that the term shear movement is better referred to as interface-preserving movement and hinge as interface-creating movement. these more prosaic terms are still broadly consistent with the original concept but should not lead to misinterpretation. our analysis has shown that for proteins with domain movements classified as shear, the movement does not involve a significant translation of the two domains but a rotation about an axis within the body of the protein just as for a protein undergoing a domain movement via the hinge mechanism. we have shown that maintained and exchanged-partner contact changes are strong indicators for shear, whereas exchanged-pair and new contact changes are strong indicators for hinge. the finding that there are significantly more twisting movements in the shear set than in the hinge set is consistent with the notion that a twisting movement can preserve the domain interface. this offers one explanation of how a rotational movement can preserve an interface without relative translation. however, not all predominantly interface-preserving movements occur via a twisting motion; many can still occur via a closure motion by rotation about well-defined hinges.the case of citrate synthase illustrates how a predominantly shear movement as designated by dbmm would still be appropriately described as hinge-bending even though it is in our mixed class (prediction value of 0.55) with slightly more interface-preserving features than interface creating.shows the dcg for citrate synthase. there are 10 maintained contact changes, 2 exchanged-partner contact changes, 2 exchangedpartner contact changes and 6 new contact changes. it has a well-defined hinge axis created by mechanical hinges, one of which is a hinged-loop , a loop flanked by two bending regions through which the hinge axis passes. this hinged-loop clearly helps control the domain movement just as a hinge would in a protein conventionally regarded as undergoing closure via hinge bending, e.g. lactoferrin. the domain movement in citrate synthase is also an example of a protein that undergoes closure (84) via hinge bending, but one that preserves some part of the domain interface.
