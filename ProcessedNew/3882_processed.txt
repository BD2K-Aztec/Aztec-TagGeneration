rapmap: a rapid, sensitive and accurate tool for mapping rna-seq reads to transcriptomes motivation: the alignment of sequencing reads to a transcriptome is a common and important step in many rna-seq analysis tasks. when aligning rna-seq reads directly to a transcriptome (as is common in the de novo setting or when a trusted reference annotation is available), care must be taken to report the potentially large number of multi-mapping locations per read. this can pose a substantial computational burden for existing aligners, and can considerably slow downstream analysis. results: we introduce a novel concept, quasi-mapping, and an efficient algorithm implementing this approach for mapping sequencing reads to a transcriptome. by attempting only to report the potential loci of origin of a sequencing read, and not the base-to-base alignment by which it derives from the reference, rapmapour tool implementing quasi-mappingis capable of mapping sequencing reads to a target transcriptome substantially faster than existing alignment tools. the algorithm we use to implement quasi-mapping uses several efficient data structures and takes advantage of the special structure of shared sequence prevalent in transcriptomes to rapidly provide highly-accurate mapping information. we demonstrate how quasi-mapping can be successfully applied to the problems of transcript-level quantification from rna-seq reads and the clustering of contigs from de novo assembled transcriptomes into biologically meaningful groups. availability and implementation: rapmap is implemented in c 11 and is available as open-source software, under gpl v3, at https://github.com/combine-lab/rapmap.the bioinformatics community has put tremendous effort into building a wide array of different tools to solve the read-alignment problem efficiently. these tools use many different strategies to quickly find potential alignment locations for reads; for example, bowtie , bowtie 2 , bwa and bwa-mem use variants of the fm-index, while tools like the subread aligner , maq and mrsfast use k-mer-based indices to help align reads efficiently. because read alignment is such a ubiquitous task, the goal of such tools is often to provide accurate results as quickly as possible. indeed, recent alignment tools like star demonstrate that rapid alignment of sequenced reads is possible, and tools like hisat demonstrate that this speed can be achieved with only moderate memory usage. when reads are aligned to a collection of reference sequences that share a substantial amount of sub-sequence (near or exact repeats), a single read can have many potential alignments, and considering all such alignment can be crucial for downstream analysis (e.g. considering all alignment locations for a read within a transcriptome for the purpose of quantification, li and dewey (2011), or when attempting to cluster de novo assembled contigs by shared multi-mapping reads,). however, reporting multiple potential alignments for each read is a difficult task, and tends to substantially slow down even efficient alignment tools. yet, in many cases, all of the information provided by the alignments is not necessary. for example, in the transcript analysis tasks mentioned above, simply the knowledge of the transcripts and positions to which a given read maps well is sufficient to answer the questions being posed. in support of such analysis-efficient computation, we propose a novel concept, called quasi-mapping, and an efficient algorithm implementing quasi-mapping (exposed in the software tool rapmap) to solve the problem of mapping sequenced reads to a target transcriptome. this algorithm is considerably faster than state-of-the-art aligners, and achieves its impressive speed by v c the author 2016. published by oxford university press.
