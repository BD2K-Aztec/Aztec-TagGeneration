genome analysis molbiolib: a cþþ11 framework for rapid development and deployment of bioinformatics tasks we developed molbiolib to address the need for adaptable next-generation sequencing analysis tools. the result is a compact, portable and extensively tested c11 software framework and set of applications tailored to the demands of next-generation sequencing data and applicable to many other applications. molbiolib is designed to work with common file formats and data types used both in genomic analysis and general data analysis. a central relational-database-like table class is a flexible and powerful object to intuitively represent and work with a wide variety of tabular datasets, ranging from alignment data to annotations. molbiolib has been used to identify causative single-nucleotide polymorphisms in whole genome sequencing, detect balanced chromosomal rearrangements and compute enrichment of messenger rnas (mrnas) on microtubules, typically requiring applications of under 200 lines of code. molbiolib includes programs to perform a wide variety of analysis tasks, such as computing read coverage, annotating gen-omic intervals and novel peak calling with a wavelet algorithm. although molbiolib was designed primarily for bioinformatics purposes , much of its functionality is applicable to a wide range of problems. complete documentation and an extensive automated test suite are provided. availability: molbiolib is available for download at: http://sourceforge .net/projects/molbiolib contactnext-generation sequencing requires a data analysis approach capable of handling large, complex and varied datasets, from large sets of reads to complex polymorphisms to existing feature files. in addition, the competitive nature of research demands rapid development of methods that are flexible enough to integrate new and quickly evolving algorithms. tools have been developed to address these needs, such as gatk . however, packages written in java (e.g. gatk) require the maximum memory heap space to be specified at run time , limiting how the input data are formatted and handled. for example, a coverage program would require more memory to compute coverage of a query-ordered sam file versus a position-ordered sam file, because a sliding window of coverage cannot be used. programs written in c do not require the heap size to be specified and are only limited by the amount of available memory. other packages written in c have their strengths, but they also have limitations that suggest a niche for our software, molbiolib. arachne , the .net bio project by outercurve foundation (outercurve, 2012) and ncbis c toolkit provide many functions, but are not compact and do not always clearly identify the primary objects. furthermore, the .net bio project is specific to the windows environment and arachne is specific to a particular linux environment. ibms genomictools has many very useful tools, but addresses common bioinformatics tasks at a lower level than molbiolib, such as providing command-line tools rather than a unified program to generate chip-seq output. other packages, such as bio , libsequence and tigr , are targeted toward specific applications and not designed to provide breadth of functionality. the package that most closely resembles molbiolibs philosophy is seqan , though it is written in an older version of c and thus does not take advantage of the variadic templates or other modern features of c11 (iso/iec, 2011). molbiolib fills the need for a platform-independent, extensively tested, compact and efficient c11 library and an extensive set of bioinformatics applications that can be used to analyze data and rapidly develop new tools. molbiolibs library includes a variety of useful objects and functions, such as a relationaldatabase-like object, a text file reader object that simplifies data input, statistical functions and peak calling methods that can operate on any array of values, such as per base sequence coverage. in addition, molbiolib includes a broad range of tools, such as to generate coverage, hits of reads to features and chip-seq, all in one unified package. the design of molbiolib is based on four principles. the first is to simplify bioinformatics programming in c11, achieved by developing a library that includes many common bioinformatics tasks. for example, c11 requires programmers to write specialized data structures to sort associated data keeping them together, such as feature information associated with a position. additionally, to iterate either sequentially or randomly through a tab-separated-values (tsv) file and select values from specific columns would require the creation of a function to split to whom correspondence should be addressed.

to index and traverse a text file. these, and many other common tasks, are built into molbiolib, thus greatly simplifying the code one needs to write. it is hoped that molbiolib will allow bioinformaticians to consider c11 as a possible language of choice. second, molbiolib is efficient. c11 is used because it is the new standard that introduces constructs for making objects such as table. c11 is efficient since it is a compiled language with no inherent restriction on memory heap size at run time. templates are used extensively to compact code, avoid inefficient virtual table lookups and maintain type safety. objects and method parameters are often templated so that they may be in-lined by the compiler. third, molbiolib promotes clarity and compactness by consolidating common operations into a concise set of objects. we also provide an extensive library of functions that are not intrinsic to one object, such as those that convert one data type to another, e.g. splitstring converts a string to a vector5string4. given the range of problems molbiolib addresses, the source code is compact: 10 000 lines of code and comments for the core objects and functions. among the 101 included applications, 86 are coded in fewer than 200 lines and 59 in fewer than 100 lines. in contrast, without such a framework, the user would have to code the thousands of lines of code to reproduce molbiolibs functionality. finally, molbiolib is extensively tested and facilitates easy testing and debugging of its applications. automated tests are provided for all objects and functions. additional validation of the code base comes from extensive application of molbiolib to many molecular biology projects (; raif s. geha, manuscript in preparation). to simplify use of molbiolib, all libraries are include files following the boost convention . debugging and memory checking is thus facilitated with tools such as with valgrind (; seward and) since applications in molbiolib consist of a main program file with many include files. additional input and programming checks are incorporated into the framework through optional compiler flags.molbiolib fills the need for an efficient, reliable and compact c11 bioinformatics framework. it is portable across many platforms and aligner formats and is fully documented. molbiolib is unique in offering complete analysis programs for a variety of other very common tasks not addressed by other toolkits, from feature hit counts to coverage to chip-seq. molbiolib classes offer considerable power and convenience for creating novel analysis applications. a central and very general table class simulating the functionality of a database eases construction of many programs. the table class is based on a collection vectors, thus having a small memory overhead compared to other data structures such as a map. capacity for larger datasets is only limited by the amount of available memory. file readers provide efficient methods to perform ubiquitous file i/o tasks. these classes will have general utility for application development beyond the specific needs of computational biology. as molbiolib gains adoption, we aim to incorporate many of the applications both user-contributed and those developed for our projects into the main distribution through the sourceforge. net code repository mechanism.
