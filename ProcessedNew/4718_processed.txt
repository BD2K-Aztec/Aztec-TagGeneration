genome analysis track data hubs enable visualization of user-defined genome-wide annotations on the ucsc genome browser track data hubs provide an efficient mechanism for visualizing remotely hosted internet-accessible collections of genome annotations. hub datasets can be organized, configured and fully integrated into the university of california santa cruz (ucsc) genome browser and accessed through the familiar browser interface. for the first time, individuals can use the complete browser feature set to view custom datasets without the overhead of setting up and maintaining a mirror. availability and implementation: source code for the bigwig, bigbed and genome browser software is freely available for non-commercial use at http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/jksrc.zip, implemented in c and supported on linux. binaries for the bigwig and bigbed creation and parsing utilities may be downloaded atthe widespread use of high-throughput sequencing technology has challenged the capabilities of genomic data visualization tools as the volume and size of genome-wide datasets outpace the capacity of existing browsing technology. in response, the university of california santa cruz (ucsc) has repeatedly extended its popular genome-browsing tool, the ucsc genome browser , to offer increased visualization of remotely hosted large datasets. in recent years, ucsc added browser support for four compressed binary indexed data formats: bigbed and bigwig , both developed at ucsc, binary alignment/map (bam) and variant call format (vcf)/tabix . this allowed individuals to quickly and efficiently view and share genome-wide data hosted on their own local servers using the browsers well-established custom track mechanism. however, the limited configuration and organization options imposed by custom tracks presented a barrier to full integration of large datasets into the browser, leading many research groups to set up mirrors to visualize their tracks in a full local instance of the browser. mirrors pose their own drawbacks: they tend to have limited visibility and distribution within the research community and incur a local maintenance overhead. to circumvent these limitations, ucsc has introduced support for track data hubs, internet-accessible collections of genome annotations that can be viewed on the ucsc genome browser alongside native annotation tracks . track data hubs provide the power and flexibility to organize, configure and fully integrate one or more large datasets into the browser and allow efficient worldwide access to the data through the familiar genome browser interface. individuals experienced in setting up genome browser mirrors will find that setting up a track data hub is much easier. depending on the number and complexity of the datasets, a track data hub typically can be set up in a day or two. like the distributed annotation system (das) , track data hubs provide access to annotation over the internet, but they differ in that the server hosting a track data hub requires only http access instead of a dedicated das server. in contrast to the extensible mark-up language format of das, which may be easier for a simple application to access, track data hubs present data in the native format of the data files with a rich set of options for controlling how that data should displayed. although this requires more complicated logic on the client end to parse and display, it offers the data contributor more options for configuring and presenting the data. track data hub annotations are stored at the remote site as compressed binary indexed files. when a hub track is displayed in the genome browser, only the relevant data needed to support the view of the current genomic region are transmitted to ucsc, rather than the entire file. the transmitted data are cached on a ucsc server to expedite future access. this on-demand transfer mechanism eliminates the need to transmit large datasets across the internet, thereby minimizing upload time into the browser. hub tracks are displayed in a separate track group below the browser image and can be configured and manipulated in the same fashion as native tracks. they can be incorporated into to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2013. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. browser sessions and custom tracks in the same manner as other tracks, and the underlying data can be viewed, manipulated and downloaded using the ucsc table browser .
