sequence analysis fast construction of fm-index for long sequence reads we present a new method to incrementally construct the fm-index for both short and long sequence reads, up to the size of a genome. it is the first algorithm that can build the index while implicitly sorting the sequences in the reverse (complement) lexicographical order without a separate sorting step. the implementation is among the fastest for indexing short reads and the only one that practically works for reads of averaged kilobases in length. availability and implementation: https://github.com/fm-index plays an important role in dna sequence alignment, de novo assembly and compression . fast and lightweight construction of fmindex for a large dataset is the key to these applications. in this context, a few algorithms have been developed that substantially outperform earlier algorithms. however, they are only efficient for short reads. a fast and practical algorithm for long sequence reads is still lacking. this work aims to fill this gap.
