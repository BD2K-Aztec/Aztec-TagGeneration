genome analysis socrates: identification of genomic rearrangements in tumour genomes by re-aligning soft clipped reads motivation: methods for detecting somatic genome rearrangements in tumours using next-generation sequencing are vital in cancer gen-omics. available algorithms use one or more sources of evidence, such as read depth, paired-end reads or split reads to predict structural variants. however, the problem remains challenging due to the significant computational burden and high false-positive or false-negative rates. results: in this article, we present socrates (soft clip realignment to identify structural variants), a highly efficient and effective method for detecting genomic rearrangements in tumours that uses only split-read data. socrates has single-nucleotide resolution, identifies micro-homologies and untemplated sequence at break points, has high sensitivity and high specificity and takes advantage of parallelism for efficient use of resources. we demonstrate using simulated and real data that socrates performs well compared with a number of existing structural variant detection tools. availability and implementation: socrates is released as open source and available from http://bioinf.the identification of somatic rearrangements in tumour genomes using next-generation sequencing (ngs) data is an important step in characterizing cancers, including identifying genomic instability , understanding tumour evolution and identifying potential fusion genes . however, prediction of genomic rearrangements remains a challenging bioinformatics problem. existing methods suffer from a variety of issues, including high false-positive (see, for further discussion) or false-negative rates depending on the methods, data and nature of the genomic rearrangements. to identify genomic rearrangements or structural variants (svs), dna from samples is extracted, fragmented, size selected and typically paired end (pe) sequenced. there are four distinct approaches to identifying genomic rearrangements using these data: read depth, paired end, split reads and de novo assembly methods. read depth methods (rd) identify one class of structural variationcopy number variants. they provide only indirect evidence for break points and no information about genomic organization. rd methods involve counting reads in windows and segmenting the counts (see e.g.). they may use single-end (se) or paired-end reads. their resolution and accuracy is dependent on the depth of coverage and the window size, but is typically of the order of kilobases. examples of rd methods include readdepth and cnvnator . anomalous pairedend alignment methods (pe) use reads that contain a break point in the unsequenced region between the paired reads. these reads map anomalously or discordantly to the reference genomefurther apart or closer together than expected based on the selected fragment size, to different chromosomes or with inverted orientation (see e.g.). the signal of a rearrangement is a cluster of anomalous reads. the resolution of pe methods is related to the fragment size and coverage. in general, single-nucleotide resolution is not possible with pe methods. breakdancer is an example of a pe method. split read methods (sr) rely on reads that span the break point . split reads may be identified from singleend or paired-end sequencing, although using paired-end data has the advantage of higher quality alignment. most ngs to whom correspondence should be addressed. y the authors wish it to be known that, in

while local aligners may also map part of the split read. with paired-end reads, local ngs aligners are often greedy to align reads concordantly. thus, the aligned part of a split read may be quite short [e.g. 20 nucleotides (nt)]. a straightforward approach to identifying a split read using an ngs aligner is via soft clipping. a soft clip is a special mismatch state in the alignment that is restricted to contiguous segments of the read at the 5 0 or 3 0 end . sequencing errors, chimeric reads, errors in the reference genome or genomic rearrangement may cause soft clips. sr methods are capable of single-nucleotide resolution, although micro-homologies at fusion sites mean the break point may only be known to 110 nt accuracy and large imperfect homologies at the break point may cause lower accuracy again. examples of sr methods include splitread . until recently, most methods used just one of these types of evidence. however, several methods have now appeared that make use of more of the available evidence to predict an sv. for example, delly and prism use pe evidence and incorporate sr evidence through a targeted smithwaterman alignment. cnver uses pe and rd signals to identify potential copy number changes. de novo assembly methods (dn) typically perform targeted sequence assembly following other evidence to locate the locus and reads for assembly. for example, crest uses sr then dn. however, unbiased assembly of the whole-genome data is also possible. making better use of the available evidence to predict break points is obviously desirable, but how this is undertaken is critical. to find somatic rearrangements, evidence from a tumour and a matched normal is used. typically, svs are called in both samples. variants that occur in the both genomes are most likely polymorphisms or artefacts. somatic rearrangements are obtained by subtracting predicted normal svs from the predicted tumour svs. most methods are not specifically designed for tumour genomes, and some methods that are designed for germline dna neglect certain classes of rearrangement, which are unlikely to be present as polymorphisms (e.g.), making them inappropriate for use in tumours. the reads produced by ngs platforms are increasing dramatically in length. as a result, the capacity to create dna libraries with fragments large enough to retain an unsequenced insert is decreasing and with it the utility of pe information. increased length also means read mappability and the utility of sr methods is improved. here, we describe a new method for identifying somatic rearrangements, socrates (soft clip re-alignment to identify structural variants), which currently relies only on sr evidence. socrates works by efficiently identifying clusters of soft clipped alignments in the reference genome as candidate break points. the soft clipped sequences are then extracted and realigned to the reference genome. a genomic rearrangement is predicted and break points are identified with single-nucleotide precision when soft clipped sequences from one cluster map to another with high stringency and there is reciprocal support . we have developed socrates with bowtie2 and bwa in mind, but it should work with any ngs aligner that supports 5 0 or 3 0 soft clipping. soft clips that are too short to align are also counted, but are handled by direct search of the cluster pair. the idea of re-aligning soft clips has previously been used in clipcrop , but clipcrops design is inappropriate for identifying genomic rearrangements in tumours, and our approach incorporates several novel features. socrates is designed to be fast and memory efficient. it has single-nucleotide resolution and is designed to be highly sensitive. it also has high specificity on simulated data. it identifies micro-homologies and untemplated sequence at break points and deals with promiscuous or re-used break points. our method was originally motivated by work on the emyc transgenic mouse tumour genome and the failure of existing methods to detect known fusions using pe reads from short dna fragments, but we have tested it extensively on simulated data and human tumours. despite its design for somatic tissue analysis, socrates can also be used to analyze svs in germline dna. we compare the algorithms capabilities with other established break point-detection tools using simulated and real data.
