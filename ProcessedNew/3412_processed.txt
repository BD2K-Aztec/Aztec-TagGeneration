pancghweb: a web tool for genotype calling in pangenome cgh data a pangenome is the total of genes present in strains of the same species. pangenome microarrays allow determining the genomic content of bacterial strains more accurately than conventional comparative genome hybridization microarrays. pancghweb is the first tool that effectively calls genotype based on pangenome microarray data. availability: pancghweb, the web tool is accessible from:pangenome microarrays contain probes that target all known genes within related strains of the same species .when compared to conventional comparative genome hybridization (cgh) microarrays that target the gene content of a single species, they allow to more accurately determine the genotype of a given bacterial strain . in pangenomes, orthologous genes can be defined as homologous genes derived by a strain divergence event from a single ancestral sequence. these orthologous genes (strain orthologs) share different levels of nucleotide sequence identity with paralogous genes (homologous genes derived by a duplication event from a single sequence) . effective genotyping can be achieved by grouping genes into ortholog groups (ogs) and subsequently genotyping at the level of ogs. recently, we published an algorithm (pancgh) that effectively deals with assigning og presence/absence to each strain analyzed by pangenome microarrays . here, we describe a web toolpancghwebthat uses this algorithm to effectively genotype strains based on pangenome microarray data.
