genome analysis svgenes: a library for rendering genomic features in scalable vector graphic format motivation: drawing genomic features in attractive and informative ways is a key task in visualization of genomics data. scalable vector graphics (svg) format is a modern and flexible open standard that provides advanced features including modular graphic design, advanced web interactivity and animation within a suitable client. svgs do not suffer from loss of image quality on re-scaling and provide the ability to edit individual elements of a graphic on the whole object level independent of the whole image. these features make svg a potentially useful format for the preparation of publication quality figures including genomic objects such as genes or sequencing coverage and for web applications that require rich user-interaction with the graphical elements. results: svgenes is a ruby-language library that uses svg primi-tives to render typical genomic glyphs through a simple and flexible ruby interface. the library implements a simple page object that spaces and contains horizontal track objects that in turn style, colour and positions features within them. tracks are the level at which visual information is supplied providing the full styling capability of the svg standard. genomic entities like genes, transcripts and histograms are modelled in glyph objects that are attached to a track and take advantage of svg primitives to render the gen-omic features in a track as any of a selection of defined glyphs. the feature model within svgenes is simple but flexible and not dependent on particular existing gene feature formats meaning graphics for any existing datasets can easily be created without need for conversion.visualization, analysis and communication of genome data is an important task in genomics. numerous desktop computer programs exist for rendering images of genomic data, usually in analytic pipelines including artemis . genome browsers such as gbrowse , jbrowse , savant and igv (thorvaldsdottir) provide interactive visualization of the data for whole genomes and draft assemblies. output from these is typically limited to an exported bitmap or screen grab in the programs particular fixed style. graphics libraries such as gd and imagemagick have been used in projects like bioperl and bioruby to create uniquely styled bitmap images like png and jpeg programmatically. biorubys bio-graphics package has similar functionality to bio-svgenes and relies on external libraries such as cairo, pango and imagemagick. the bio.graphics module in biopython also supports output in svg through the use of third-party software [reportlab (http://www.reportlab.com/)]. bitmap images are limited in that they are not easy to re-annotate, re-scale and often cannot be reproduced for publication or presentation with high-fidelity because of limitations of the original bitmaps. bitmaps can be difficult to manipulate and are not easily amenable to the addition of interactive features. interactive graphics can be provided in web-browsers through javascript libraries such as d3.js but there are no such libraries available specifically for easy rendering of genomic data. scalable vector graphics (svg) is an xml-based graphic standard under development by the world wide web consortium that provides many advantages for those seeking to produce rich, attractive images. svg is a vector format so does not suffer image quality degradation on rescaling, has advanced image features such as alpha masks and filter effects, web-interactivity and can be styled with cascading style sheets. furthermore, as a textbased format, svg is well suited for searching and indexing in databases and is amenable to lossless compression. svg can be rendered by modern web-browsers and graphics software including adobes illustrator and the open source inkscape programs. svg output is available from some applications. cgview and circos are good tools for viewing circular genomes in particular. genomediagram is designed to display large amounts of comparative genomics data. mgv is a database-driven web application designed specifically for microbial data and annotationsketch , which is dependant on third-party software. svgenes is a pure ruby language library that allows a user to set styles for tracks of genomic features and will automatically layout and generate svg images composed of several pre-defined genomics glyphs, including genes, transcripts, data and single-nucleotide features. to

flexible library for creating easily manipulated, high-quality, web-friendly images of genomic data quickly and easily in svg format without embedding a bitmap. the library can be used for visualization at many levels; in highthroughput pipelines and web applications, but individual users preparing figures for publication will also find the library extremely useful, as the individual elements of the images can be independently manipulated and annotated and composited.
