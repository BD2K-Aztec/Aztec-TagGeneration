pseknc-general: a cross-platform package for generating various modes of pseudo nucleotide compositions the avalanche of genomic sequences generated in the post-genomic age requires efficient computational methods for rapidly and accurately identifying biological features from sequence information. towards this goal, we developed a freely available and open-source package, called pseknc-general (the general form of pseudo k-tuple nucleotide composition), that allows for fast and accurate computation of all the widely used nucleotide structural and physicochemical properties of both dna and rna sequences. pseknc-general can generate several modes of pseudo nucleotide compositions, including conventional k-tuple nucleotide compositions, moreaubroto autocorrelation coefficient, moran autocorrelation coefficient , geary autocorrelation coefficient, type i pseknc and type ii pseknc. in every mode, 4100 physicochemical properties are available for choosing. moreover, it is flexible enough to allow the users to calculate pseknc with user-defined properties. the package can be run on linux, mac and windows systems and also provides a graph-ical user interface. availability and implementation: the package is freely available at: http://
