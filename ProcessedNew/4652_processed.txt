genome analysis the uniqueome: a mappability resource for short-tag sequencing quantification applications of short-tag sequencing data (such as cnvseq and rnaseq) depend on knowing the uniqueness of specific genomic regions at a given threshold of error. here, we present the uniqueome, a genomic resource for understanding the uniquely mappable proportion of genomic sequences. pre-computed data are available for human, mouse, fly and worm genomes in both color-space and nucletotide-space, and we demonstrate the utility of this resource as applied to the quantification of rnaseq data. availability: files, scripts and supplementary data are available from
