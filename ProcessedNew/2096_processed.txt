systems biology gosemsim: an r package for measuring semantic similarity among go terms and gene products the semantic comparisons of gene ontology (go) annotations provide quantitative ways to compute similarities between genes and gene groups, and have became important basis for many bioinformatics analysis approaches. gosemsim is an r package for semantic similarity computation among go terms, sets of go terms, gene products and gene clusters. four information content (ic)-and a graph-based methods are implemented in the gosemsim package, multiple species including human, rat, mouse, fly and yeast are also supported. the functions provided by the gosemsim offer flexibility for applications, and can be easily integrated into high-throughput analysis pipelines. availability: gosemsim is released under the gnu general public license within bioconductor project, and freely available atthe gene ontology (go) is becoming the de facto standard for the annotation of gene products. the go consortium annotates gene products with terms from three orthogonal ontologies organized as directed acyclic graphs, laying the foundation for quantitative semantic comparisons. several metrics have been proposed to measure the semantic similarity between go annotations, and have been verified in terms of the correlations with sequence similarity proteinprotein interactions , and gene expression profiles . the go semantic similarity provides the basis for functional comparison of gene products, and therefore has been widely used in bioinformatics applications, such as protein sub-nuclear localization prediction , gene function prediction and cluster analysis of genes . two typical approaches to measure semantic similarity of go terms are information content (ic)-and graph-based measures. to whom correspondence should be addressed. the authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first two authors should be regarded as joint first authors.the ic-based measures depend on the frequencies of two go terms involved and that of their closest common ancestor term in a specific corpus of go annotations, such as the uniprot knowledgebase. three ic-based measures, resniks , lins and jiang and conraths have been introduced from natural language taxonomies byto compare gene products in early time. on the basis of resniks and lins definition, an ic-based measure has also been presented by. considering that the specificity of a go term is usually determined by its location in the go graph,proposed a graph-based strategy to compute semantic similarity using the topology of the go graph structure. in the wangs method, the semantics of go terms are encoded into a numeric format and the different semantic contributions of the distinct relations are considered. several online tools for semantic similarity measurement of gene products are available at present, such as g-sesame and fussimeg (http://xldb.fc.ul.pt/rebil/ssm/). to facilitate large-scale analysis, two freely available software packages, gograph and gosim implementing classic ic-based methods for semantic comparison of go terms have also been developed. here, we present an r package named gosemsim to compute semantic similarity among go terms, sets of go terms, gene products and gene clusters, providing both ic-and graph-based methods.
