systems biology fastmedusa: a parallelized tool to infer gene regulatory networks motivation: in order to construct gene regulatory networks of higher organisms from gene expression and promoter sequence data efficiently, we developed fastmedusa. in this parallelized version of the regulatory network-modeling tool medusa, expression and sequence data are shared among a user-defined number of processors on a single multi-core machine or cluster. our results show that fastmedusa allows a more efficient utilization of computational resources. while the determination of a regulatory network of brain tumor in homo sapiens takes 12 days with medusa, fastmedusa obtained the same results in 6 h by utilizing 100 processors. availability: source code and documentation of fastmedusa are available at https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/nobbioinf/fastmedusa contact:among the numerous ways to determine gene regulatory networks of higher organism , medusa is a well-known and powerful computational tool . utilizing a boosting algorithm , medusa models promoter sequences and gene expression data from various experimental conditions. providing a global predictive model of condition-specific expression states of target genes, medusa has been successfully used to discover novel regulators in oxygen and heme regulatory networks in saccharomyces cerevisiae . although medusa is a powerful computational tool for inferring gene regulatory networks, it has certain limitations. medusa requires the commercially available software package, matlab. in addition, the execution time of medusa increases dramatically with larger sizes of input data sets. for example, medusa needed 4 weeks for the modeling and analysis of about 7000 genes using 1000 iterations. parallel computing has been used to solve the latter problem for several bioinformatics applications to date . here we introduce fastmedusa, a fast, parallelized, open source implementation of medusa in c++ that uses freely available libraries. our benchmark results showed thatwe tested the performance of fastmedusa and medusa by controlling for the number of iterations and the number of processors used. specifically, we defined the performance increase of fastmedusa utilizing i iterations and n processors, where t is the execution time. the results on the yeast and human data sets show that fastmedusa consistently outperforms medusa . for instance, medusa takes about 12 days to analyze the human glioma data set utilizing 400 iterations, whereas fastmedusa analyzes the same data set and obtains the same adts in about 6 h utilizing 100 processors. fastmedusa is also about 30 faster than medusa in serial mode. the slope of the performance increase reduces for increasing computing resources because of the increase in the cost of inter-process communications.
