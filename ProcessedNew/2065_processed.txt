glay: community structure analysis of biological networks glay provides cytoscape users an assorted collection of versatile community structure algorithms and graph layout functions for network clustering and structured visualization. high performance is achieved by dynamically linking highly optimized c functions to the cytoscape java program, which makes glay especially suitable for decomposition, display and exploratory analysis of large biological networks.with the rapid development in experimental and computational technology, the scale and dimension of accumulated molecular interaction data have increased dramatically. many online repositories, such as michigan molecular interaction (mimi;), have made extensive gene-wise interaction data readily available. the challenge is then how to systematically explore and visualize such large and complex datasets for biological inferences. one solution is to decompose such an interaction network into communities of densely interacting nodes and imply functional modules. a variety of community detection algorithms have been developed to tackle similar challenges in social networks and they have been successfully extended to the biological context (proposed an interesting generic method combing association networks with community structure detection algorithms to infer network modules from microarray data. cytoscape is a well-established open source software foundation for analysis and visualization of biological networks. currently there are several plugins developed for clustering and functional module detection, such as mcode , nemo and clustermaker (http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/ cytoscape/cluster/clustermaker.html). however, some algorithms in clustermaker, such as kmeans or hierarchical, require the network to have numerical attributes to compute a distance matrix for clustering. mcode and nemo are engineered to identify small and highly intra-connected clusters in a network, without clustering all the nodes. for example, when executed on a mimi human to whom correspondence should be addressed. interactome network of 11 884 nodes and 88 134 edges using the default parameters, mcode produced 105 clusters, in which 52 clusters contain less than five nodes. therefore, it may not be suitable for global subdividing large networks for exploratory analysis. in addition, some of these plugins were not tailored for large networks. for example, nemo failed when executing on the same mimi network on a 2.67 ghz intel core i7 machine. so far, no plugin offers a comprehensive collection of highly efficient community detection algorithms, which could profoundly improve cluster analysis if added to cytoscape. the increasing size and complexity of networks also bring significant challenges to visualization. generating a layout on such a network not only consumes considerable time and computational resources, but also rarely produces any informative outcome. a typical case is a massive hairball as a result of applying forcebased layout to a large network (500 nodes) with many edges . visual separation of clusters in a network can be improved by overlaying community structure on a graphic layout addressing specific topology. we therefore developed this cytoscape glay plugin to make commonly used community structure detection algorithms available. glay also provides layout algorithms optimized for large networks. glay not only supplements existing clustering functions, but also provides structured and informative visualization for more efficient exploration and analysis of large biological networks.summarizes the incorporated community detection algorithms. because of the distinct heuristics of algorithms, running speed and the resultant community structures vary. some algorithms, such as the leading eigenvector algorithm, works well on a small network of a few hundred nodes but may not be scalable for large networks. others are optimized for large datasets but may be less accurate. for example, the fast greedy algorithm may produce communities with skewed community size distribution because of the greedy optimization of the modularity score . users may test different algorithms and evaluate performance by various benchmarks such as modularity, number of communities and community size distribution.lists glay layout algorithms. these algorithms are able to efficiently layout very large networks or generate hierarchical trees. a key advantage of glay layout is that it allows the layout calculations of various algorithms to initiate from the current network layout state. this adds significant flexibility since it enables the user to progressively improve the layout by either finetuning parameters or using different layout algorithms together. for example, for a very large network, the user may specify a small number of iterations to obtain a draft layout, and then gradually refine the layout by adding more iterations or tuning the parameters. once done, the user may superimpose the community structure on the layout to investigate network topology. for more information, please refer to the plugin homepage and igraph library documentation .
