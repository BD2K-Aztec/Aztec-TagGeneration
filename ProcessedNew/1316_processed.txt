dendropy: a python library for phylogenetic computing dendropy is a cross-platform library for the python programming language that provides for object-oriented reading, writing, simulation and manipulation of phylogenetic data, with an emphasis on phylogenetic tree operations. dendropy uses a splits-hash mapping to perform rapid calculations of tree distances, similarities and shape under various metrics. it contains rich simulation routines to generate trees under a number of different phylogenetic and coalescent models. dendropys data simulation and manipulation facilities, in conjunction with its support of a broad range of phylogenetic data formats (nexus, newick, phylip, fasta, nexml, etc.), allow it to serve a useful role in various phyloinformatics and phylogeographic pipelines. availability: the stable release of the library is available for download and automated installation through the python package index site (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dendropy), while the active development source code repository is available to the public from githubhere we describe dendropy, a cross-platform library for the management, manipulation and analysis of phylogenetic tree and character data using the python programming language. dendropy addresses needs of researchers in phyloinformatics and population genetics. it supports reading and writing phylogenetic data in a wide variety of file formats (nexus, phylip, fasta, nexml, etc.) to and from the same common object-oriented data model. its data model is rich and well-suited for manipulating complex datasets. objects represent both core phylogenetic entities (such as taxa, trees, and character matrices), as well both components and collections of these objects. for example, dendropys representation of phylogenetic trees includes a class for the tree itself, but also classes for nodes, directed edges and support for the concept of splits (also known as bipartitions), as well as collections of these tree objects. splits are crucial in many phylogenetic algorithms that operate on unrooted tree, such as consensus tree generation and the calculation of tree-to-tree distances . dendropys hashing of splits allows for constant-time lookup of an edge in a tree. in memory, trees are represented as rooted, but splits of either unrooted or rooted trees are efficiently stored by hashing. thus, dendropy handles both types of trees very naturally. to whom correspondence should be addressed. dendropy is designed to deal with diverse sources of datasets. character data and trees refer to rich taxon objects, and users of the library have fine grained control of how these taxa are coordinated or kept separate across different sources of data. thus, importing information from a wide variety of sources can be accomplished without unintentionally concatenating information. this makes dendropy a convenient tool in the domains of bioinformatics (e.g. phylogenetic supermatrix assembly and phylogeography), in which the character data associated with trees is derived from multiple exemplars of the same biological taxon. dendropy also provides a rich framework for the simulation of trees under a variety of branching models, such as the birthdeath model (uniform or variable), the coalescent , the censored coalescent , etc. below we describe the main features of dendropy in more detailed terms, and discuss its relationship to the existing python libraries for bioinformatics.
