emdomics: a robust and powerful method for the identification of genes differentially expressed between heterogeneous classes motivation: a major goal of biomedical research is to identify molecular features associated with a biological or clinical class of interest. differential expression analysis has long been used for this purpose; however, conventional methods perform poorly when applied to data with high within class heterogeneity. results: to address this challenge, we developed emdomics, a new method that uses the earth movers distance to measure the overall difference between the distributions of a genes expression in two classes of samples and uses permutations to obtain q-values for each gene. we applied emdomics to the challenging problem of identifying genes associated with drug resistance in ovar-ian cancer. we also used simulated data to evaluate the performance of emdomics, in terms of sensitivity and specificity for identifying differentially expressed gene in classes with high within class heterogeneity. in both the simulated and real biological data, emdomics outperformed competing approaches for the identification of differentially expressed genes, and emdomics was significantly more powerful than conventional methods for the identification of drug resistance-associated gene sets. emdomics represents a new approach for the identification of genes differentially expressed between heterogeneous classes and has utility in a wide range of complex biomedical conditions in which sample classes show within class heterogeneity. availability and implementation: the r package is available atgenomic methods enable the measurement of tens-of-thousands to millions of molecular analytes in parallel from a single sample. a major goal of biomedical research is to use these technologies to identify molecular features (e.g. gene-expression patterns) associated with a biological or clinical class of interest, leading to improved understanding of disease pathogenesis and the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutics. statistical methods have beenin this work we proposed to use the distance between the distributions of expression values (for array-based data) or normalized read counts (for sequence-based data) to identify differentially expressed genes when there is a high level of heterogeneity between and within the groups. we developed a new method (emdomics), based on the earth movers distance (emd), for computing the distance between the distributions of expression values or normalized read counts and for the identification of genes significantly differentially expressed between heterogeneous groups. conventional methods, such as t-test-based or fisher exact testbased approaches, perform well for the identification of genes differentially expressed between homogeneous classes of samples.however, many problems in biology and biomedicine contain samples that show both significant intra-and inter-class heterogeneity. if the sources and structure of the heterogeneity are known ahead of time, then they may be incorporated into the analysis using conventional approaches (e.g. stratification, inclusion of an interaction term); however, frequently the sources and structure of intra-group heterogeneity are unknown. in these cases, failure to account for the presence of intra-group heterogeneity will result in high intra-group variance driving high p-values, even for genes that may truly be associated with a biological class. our analyses, on both simulated and real data, show that considering whole distributions with emdomics has more power to capture heterogeneity and identify genes and gene sets that are expressed differently between two heterogeneous groups. the emdomics method has several strengths and limitations. its primary strength is that it is a robust non-parametric method, which does not make any assumptions about the distributions or differences between the two classes being compared, and thus has significantly more power than conventional approaches for identifying differential omics features between heterogeneous classes. thus, the method can be applied in a wide variety of settings to compare distributions of omics data between two classes. a further strength of the method is that efficient algorithms are available to compute emd . however, there is no free lunch in statistics , and emdomics has a few limitations. first, emdomics can currently only be used for two class problems and cannot be used with quantitative or multiclass labels. second, because emd is based on comparing the histograms of the two groups it requires at least a moderate sample size ($30 samples per class) and will tend to perform poorly when there are few samples. third, a significant emd value does not allow any inference to be made regarding the direction or structure of an association; it provides evidence that a gene is expressed differently (in some way) between two classes, which can then lead to further follow-up analyses and experimental studies to more precisely characterize the association and its clinical and biological significance. despite the methods limitations, our data suggest that emdomics is a powerful new approach for identifying differentially expressed genes between heterogeneous classes of samples. although we demonstrate one application of emdomics, it can apply to identify other genomics data types (such as copy number variation data), as well as to other types of populations (such as populations of single cell measurements). given ongoing major efforts to generate massive omics datasets (ranging in scale from single cell genomics to population-based omics studies in molecular epidemiology) to investigate a wide array of questions in biomedicine, we expect emdomics to be a useful new tool for the identification of genes and gene sets differentially expressed between heterogeneous classes of samples.. area under the curve (auc), true positive rate (tpr) and false positive rate (fpr) of emdomics, cvm and ks (tpr and fpr are for q-value 0.05).
