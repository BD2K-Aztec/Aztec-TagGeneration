automated target segmentation and real space fast alignment methods for high-throughput classification and averaging of crowded cryo-electron subtomograms motivation: cryo-electron tomography allows the imaging of macro-molecular complexes in near living conditions. to enhance the nominal resolution of a structure it is necessary to align and average individual subtomograms each containing identical complexes. however, if the sample of complexes is heterogeneous, it is necessary to first classify subtomograms into groups of identical complexes. this task becomes challenging when tomograms contain mixtures of unknown complexes extracted from a crowded environment. two main challenges must be overcomed: first, classification of subtomograms must be performed without knowledge of template structures. however, most alignment methods are too slow to perform reference-free classification of a large number of (e.g. tens of thousands) of subtomo-grams. second, subtomograms extracted from crowded cellular environments, contain often fragments of other structures besides the target complex. however, alignment methods generally assume that each subtomogram only contains one complex. automatic methods are needed to identify the target complexes in a subtomogram even when its shape is unknown. results: in this article, we propose an automatic and systematic method for the isolation and masking of target complexes in subto-mograms extracted from crowded environments. moreover, we also propose a fast alignment method using fast rotational matching in real space. our experiments show that, compared with our previously proposed fast alignment method in reciprocal space, our new method significantly improves the alignment accuracy for highly distorted and especially crowded subtomograms. such improvements are important for achieving successful and unbiased high-throughput reference-free structural classification of complexes inside whole-cell tomograms.cryo-electron tomography enables the 3d imaging of macromolecular complexes at nanometer-scale resolution in near native conditions . tomograms of individual cells are essentially 3d representations of the entire proteome providing a snapshot of the distributions of protein complexes . however, comprehensive detection of individual complexes in cell tomograms is challenging because of the inherent low signal-to-noise ratio (snr), missing data, nonisotropic resolution and the fact that individual macromolecules are difficult to recognize in a highly crowded environment . most methods for detecting complexes in cell tomograms rely on a template structure, which serves as a reference in searching for a similar pattern in the tomogram (e.g.). however, for an unbiased detection and classification of all the different complexes in a cellular tomogram, template-free methods are needed . such an analysis is challenging and relies on three main steps: first, the locations of potential complexes are detected by using particle-picking methods and a subregion surrounding the potential complex is extracted (i.e. the subtomogram). second, the subtomogram regions corresponding only to the target complex must be detected, which allows masking out all background regions, which in turn contain noise and in case of crowded subtomograms also fragments of surrounding structures. third, reference-free structural classification of the masked subtomograms is performed, which is typically based on an iterative process of subtomogram alignments, classifications and averaging (e.g.). finally, the averaging of aligned subtomograms of the same complexes will enhance the nominal resolution of the resulting density maps. in this article, we address two main challenges in reference-free subtomogram classifications. first, we propose an automatic method for adaptive masking of target regions in crowded subtomograms without the knowledge of the shape of the complex. such a method is particularly important for subtomograms extracted from crowded environments, such as the cell cytoplasm. in such a case, subtomograms will also contain fragmental regions of other complexes owing to the high particle density in the tomogram. masking out these regions is of great importance in the subsequent classification process. unlike automatic masking methods based on voxel weighting or dimension reduction methods such as principle component analysis , our method is highly scalable because it is independent of the classification process and does not involve iterative processing of a large number of subtomograms. second, we propose a new method for fast rotational matching of subtomograms in real space. the 3d subtomogram alignment is computationally the most intensive step in the classification process. currently, most alignment methods are based on maximizing the overlap similarity of two subtomograms through exhaustive search over all rigid transforms (rotation and to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2013. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of

through each rotational angle, and find the best corresponding translation using fast fourier transform (fft) (e.g.). these methods are computationally intensive, which limits their applicability in reference-free classifications. to increase alignment accuracy, local search methods have been developed to refine initial alignments (e.g.). to increase computational efficiencies, two approximate alignment methods have been developed, which separate the translational from the rotational subtomogram alignments . these methods are based on similarity scores defined in the reciprocal space (i.e. fourier space). to separate translational and rotational search, these methods use an approximate score that introduces translational invariance by eliminating the phase information of the complex coefficients in the reciprocal space and use only the magnitude of the fourier coefficients . by expressing the structural information in spherical harmonics (sh) expansion, it is possible to formulate the rotational alignment as a fast rotational matching, which simultaneously calculates alignment scores of all rotations using fft. this procedure significantly increases the alignment speed. for example, our previously published method achieved between hundreds to thousands fold speedup (depending on subtomograms size and rotational angle interval) compared with the standard scanning-based alignment method (forster) by using a translational invariance approximation of a similarity score equivalent to a popular score proposed by (forster). however, formulating the fast rotational matching in reciprocal space has some limitations. in reciprocal space, the majority of informative signals of a complex is usually contained in a relatively small amount of high magnitude fourier coefficients . these coefficients are often occupying relatively few voxels in the reciprocal space located within a small region centered at the origin. therefore, the sh expansion in the fast rotational matching may be hampered by interpolation errors, which reduces the accuracy in the alignment process. in contrast, in real space, the signal covers a wider area within a subtomogram, and the sh expansion is expected to be more accurate. it is therefore beneficial to formulate fast rotational matching in real space. in addition, real space fast rotational matching uses the full constrained alignment score instead of a translation invariant approximation when the method is expressed in reciprocal space . here, we devise an improved alignment method, which formulates the fast rotational matching of subtomograms in real space. to achieve this goal, we first identify a keypoint in the target complex whose relative location is invariant to rigid transformations and serves as the center of rotation in the fast rotational matching of the two subtomograms. a natural choice is the center of mass of a complex. however, detection of the center of mass is not trivial and cannot be approximated by the geometrical or mass density center of the subtomogram. the reason for this complication is that tomograms are images of the crowded cellular environment , and a subtomogram contains not necessarily mass density of only one single complex. when a potential complex is detected and its subtomogram extracted as a rectangular cube then this subtomogram typically contains also fragments of other surrounding structures that occupy parts of the subtomogram. then, the center of mass estimation and subtomogram alignment are affected by the existence of the additional mass density in the subtomogram. it is necessary to focus only on the regions that contain the actual target complex. even when a subtomogram does not contain any surrounding structures, its mean intensity is often close to background intensity owing to the suppression of low frequency signal owing to the contrast transfer function (ctf) effect, which also makes the estimation of the center of mass of the complex inaccurate. applying our automatic target complex segmentation method, it is possible to estimate a center of mass based only on the target complex regions in the subtomogram (i.e. the constrained center of mass). once the constrained center of mass is detected, we design a fast subtomogram alignment method that uses real space signals and takes into account missing wedge corrections using reciprocal space signals. moreover, the alignment focuses exclusively on the target complex regions in each subtomogram, which significantly decreases the influence of background noise and surrounding structures to the alignment process. our experiments show that our new approach significantly increases the alignment accuracy compared with our previous proposed fast alignment method for highly distorted subtomograms. most importantly, the new method is highly robust to the influence of surrounding structures inside crowded subtomograms.
