learning subgroup-specific regulatory interactions and regulator independence with paradigm high-dimensional -omics profiling provides a detailed molecular view of individual cancers; however, understanding the mechanisms by which tumors evade cellular defenses requires deep knowledge of the underlying cellular pathways within each cancer sample. we extended the paradigm algorithm (vaske et al., 2010, bioinformatics, 26, i237i245), a pathway analysis method for combining multiple -omics data types, to learn the strength and direction of 9139 gene and protein interactions curated from the literature. using genomic and mrna expression data from 1936 samples in the cancer genome atlas (tcga) cohort, we learned interactions that provided support for and relative strength of 7138 (78) of the curated links. gene set enrichment found that genes involved in the strongest interactions were significantly enriched for transcriptional regulation, apop-tosis, cell cycle regulation and response to tumor cells. within the tcga breast cancer cohort, we assessed different interaction strengths between breast cancer subtypes, and found interactions associated with the myc pathway and the er alpha network to be among the most differential between basal and luminal a subtypes. paradigm with the naive bayesian assumption produced gene activity predictions that, when clustered, found groups of patients with better separation in survival than both the original version of paradigm and a version without the assumption. we found that this naive bayes assumption was valid for the vast majority of co-regulators, indicating that most co-regulators act independently on their shared target.high-throughput genomic technologies have created increasingly larger sets of data capturing the molecular status of cells, and these advances have had great impact in the identification and understanding of the cellular mechanisms altered in cancer. identification of key targets commonly altered within specific tumors has enabled the creation of 440 targeted therapies over the past 20 years; however, the response rate of many of these drugs is still550, which highlights our incomplete understanding of the pathways around these drugs . an example of such a resistance mechanism is activation of the ras pathway in egfr altered colon cancer tumors, where mutated kras constitutively activates the ras cascade offering growth signals independently of the egfr pathway, rendering egfr blocking therapies such as cetuximab ineffective . by obtaining a more complete understanding of the key routes through which oncogenic signals travel within the cellular signaling networks, it should be possible to predict new druggable targets and identify escape routes through which tumors can evade existing treatments. approaches for integrating-omics data at the level of pathways have been increasingly popular in the last few years, with algorithms such as gsea , spia and pathologist all capable of successfully identifying altered pathways of interest given pathways curated from literature . another approach has constructed causal graphs from curated interactions in literature and used these graphs to explain expression profiles . algorithms such as aracne , mindy and conexic take in gene transcriptional information (and copy-number, in the case of conexic) to identify likely transcriptional drivers across a set of cancer samples; however, these approaches do not attempt to group drivers into functional networks identifying singular targets of interest . some newer pathway algorithms such as netbox and mutual exclusivity modules in cancer (memo) attempt to solve the problem of data integration in cancer to identify networks across multiple data types that are key to the oncogenic potential of samples. giena looks for dysregulated gene interactions within a single biological pathway but does not take in to account the topology of the pathway or prior knowledge about the direction or nature of the interactions . probabilistic graphical models have been used extensively in network analysis with landmark uses in the form of bayesian networks and markov random fields . several methods have successfully learned interactions from data through many different means, including relevance networks . our algorithm, paradigm (pathway recognition algorithm using data integration on genomic models) , uses a probabilistic graphical model to integrate multiple genomic data types on curated pathway databases and is unique for its per-sample approach that allows individual samples to be assessed alone or within the context of a cohort of interest. to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2013. published by oxford university press. this is an

interactions is essential for paradigm to infer activities within each sample. in the original implementation of paradigm, expectationmaximization (em) parameter learning was only performed by default on observational data parameters, as the limited size of available datasets prevented robust estimation of interaction parameters. when using a standard conditional probability table with discrete variables, the size of the table, and therefore the number of parameters, grows exponentially with the number of regulators, presenting additional challenges to efficient estimation of interaction parameters. however, by assuming a conditional independence of the regulators, we can replace the conditional probability table with a product of independent regulatory factors, and the number of parameters grows linearly with the number of regulators. examination of statistics related to regulatory links, rather than individual gene activities, is a view related (but not directly correlated) to that which is normally examined in high-throughput studies. by identifying regulatory links that have significantly different usage distributions within a phenotype of interest in the cohort, we can begin to examine how different regulators within a network might produce similar cellular phenotypes despite using entirely different pathways to accomplish them. additionally, these learned parameters can then be used as the basis for statistical tests to establish how well individual samples or subsets of the cohort follow the distribution of learned parameter patterns for each regulatory node. this article describes in detail this new approach and shows the overall improvement and additional analysis capabilities when applied across the tcga data.we learned regulatory interactions on a dataset of 1936 tcga tumor samples with gene expression and copy number data, from 11 tissue types. we then assessed interaction significance by a g-test and interaction sign with a correlation value. of the 9139 interactions in the pathway model that regulate a protein, 7631 (83.5) were found to be significant at an fdr of 0.05. a principal component analysis (pca) of the wpmi vectors for each interaction learned across the entire tcga cohort reveals a gradient from strong inhibition to strong activation. k-means clustering of the wpmi vectors found clusters along this gradient representing canonical interaction types ranging from strong activation to strong inhibition. of 7631 significant links, 78 (1) were placed in a cluster where the centroid was i64 a.j.going the opposite direction of how the link was annotated in the pathway. the variety of wpmi vectors shows that em was able to learn new interaction regimes that resemble activators and inhibitors as well more complex regulatory patterns. using correlation measure (see section 2), we assessed each interaction as activation or inhibition and compared with the interaction type annotated in the pathway model. there were 7357 links with both significant correlation and g-scores and of those the correlation of 219 links (3) did not agree with the direction of regulation in the pathway. this leaves 7138 (78) links that are significant by both tests and agree with the curated links. we also found that that some links had high correlation values but low significance from our g-tests; this usually happened in cases where either the parent or child distribution greatly favored a single state. we compared these results to what could be found by a straightforward pearson correlation of gene expression profiles. because we can not look at expression profiles for families and complexes, we tried two different approaches for this comparison. first, we compared our results to the expression correlation of links not involving complexes or families. of the links learned by paradigm, 1197 had significant correlation and g-scores and did not include complexes or families. for 51 of these links (4.3), the sign of correlation coefficient disagrees with the literature. on the other hand, looking only at gene expression profiles, we found 1058 non-complex non-family links with significant correlation, but 470 (44) disagreed with the sign of the pathway entry. for our second comparison, we eliminated complexes and families in our pathway by connecting all genes that were components of families and complexes directly to any gene regulated by those families and complexes. this flattening procedure resulted in 200 921 links. we found that 165 258 of these links had significantly correlated gene expression profiles, and that 81 558 of the links (49.4) had correlation that disagreed with the direction of the link in the pathway. these results indicate that the links learned by paradigm are much more in agreement with the direction of the links in literature than the correlation of gene expression profiles is. running the pca and clustering analysis on only wpmi scores learned from tcga ovarian (ov) patients (n 416) and without complex and family activation regulation produced very similar results to the pca and cluster centers shown in figures 2a and c, but found fewer significant links and a higher proportion of links that were annotated as activators, and learned as inhibitors or vice versa . when we used a flat initialization of px i jy 1=3 , we found that the cluster centers again mapped to a gradient from activation to inhibition, and there were fewer significant links and a higher proportion of link direction disagreements than with initial settings that include direction information. we expected the reduction in significant links between the entire tcga cohort and just ov samples because datasetswith a larger number of samples have more evidence to support even subtle interaction trends. the increase in proportion of links in clusters that do not agree with their annotation could be explained by the difference in sample number because any outliers would have less effect on probabilities calculated across the entire dataset. in this setting, however, these changes of link significance or direction are of interest because the tcga cohort contains many different diseases and tissue types. the pathway does not include details about the tissue or disease in which a given interaction was observed in the literature, so it is possible that in a different tissue or disease state and interaction direction could change either through mutation or some other mechanism. these direction changes are worth studying because they may give us some insight into the mechanism of the disease. our tests with flat initialization show that even without starting the link parameters in linear activation/inhibition states, a gradient across these linear relationships can be learned. many of the links that lose significance come from the middle cluster, which has little positive or negative correlation, but we also lose most of the links from the clusters with the strongest activation and inhibition signals. this suggests that by not using prior knowledge about link type, we lost some of our strongest interactions that could have been biologically relevant and could also reduce the quality of our final protein activity predictions. to test the naive bayes independence assumption presented in, we ran paradigm with both the independent and codependent regulation models on the tcga ovarian cancer samples. we tested the conditional independence assumption on the expectations calculated at each em step of the paradigm run . at every step of training, fewer co-regulators were found to be dependent upon each other. because of small feedback loops in the pathway, such as a transcription factor that regulates its own transcription, we expect that the independence assumption will fail in some cases. additionally, it is quite common for two very similar complexes, differing by only one molecule, to co-regulate the same child node, in which case we also expect the conditional independence test to fail, despite there being little conflict. consequently, we divide the cases where two co-regulators fail the independence test into coherent and incoherent classes, as shown in. additionally, two co-regulators may fail the independence test even if one of the co-regulators is an insignificant regulator, owing to the strength of the other regulator. we therefore also consider the subset of cases where both co-regulators are significant on their own. our tests show that the initial parameters produced by the weighted vote method cause almost 50 of child nodes to fail the conditional independence test, but as the em algorithm learns more likely parameter settings, fewer and fewer nodes fail the test. combining all of our tests shows that only $5 of child nodes are likely to have codependent regulators in a meaningful way. using the ovarian cancer samples, we clustered the protein activity predictions produced by the original paradigm and those from both the co-dependent and independent regulation models. we then performed kaplanmeier analysis on these clusters to see whether they had significantly differential survival profiles . we found that the clusters produced using independent regulation model activity predictions were the most separable by their survival (log-rank p 2.0 10 04 ). we also performed this test using the independent regulation model with a flat initial setting for the px i jy parameters and found that it performed worse than the original paradigm model. again, this indicates that our learning method requires prior knowledge about the type of interaction that is lost when using a flat initial interaction setting.i. a test of the significance of conditional independence of any two parents given the child. ii. test i and at least one of the parents that fails is significantly linked to the child. iii. test i and the failing triplet is incoherent. iv. tests i, ii and iii. (b) examples of coherent versus incoherent triplets. the arrows correspond to correlation with a pointed head for positive correlation (activation) and a flat head for negative correlation (inhibition). the interactions between parents are not found in the literature, so we use double sided arrows because we can not know the direction of that interactionin a tissue and setting its saturation proportional to its significance. the strongest differential g-scores were seen for links regulated by key cancer genes and complexes, including tp53, myc/max, hif1a/arnt, tap73a, e2f1 and ppararxra. of particular interest are the links regulated by ppara-rxra primarily different within gbm [brain and kirc (kidney)] and the tap73a regulatory links in ov (ovarian) and to a lesser degree in ucec (uterine endometrioid).shows a plot of the wpmi signals grouped by tissue for the activating links from ppara-rxra and tap73a, where significantly increased weights are found on the activating diagonal, indicating increased use of these links as activators in those tissues. the signature of tap73 activity potentially indicates a female reproductive or hormonal pattern of pathogenesis associated with p73 expression. tap73 promotes the expression of cell cycle inhibitors and inducers of apoptosis, one of which is the tumor suppressor bax, which acts as an inhibitor of the activity of the oncogene bcl2. bcl2 is known to be highly expressed in serous ovarian cancer, and our results here show that although tap73 is highly expressed and is a strong promoter of bax expression (and thus bcl2 inhibition), it is nonetheless ineffective in retarding tumorigenesis, suggesting that small molecule inhibition of bcl2 may be equally ineffective. not surprisingly, single-agent treatments of ovarian cancer with small molecule inhibitors of bcl2, despite high bcl2 expression in serous ovarian cancer, have not succeeded to date , suggesting a downstream blockade or attenuation of tap73-mediated activity in this type of cancer. it is important to note that almost all of the serous ovarian samples here bore mutations in p53, perhaps suggestive of an upstream shunting of tumorigenesis as well that perhaps overcomes tap73 over-expression or increased activity. other groups have additionally shown the importance of ppararxra activity in both gbm and kirc and their sensitivity to fenofibrate, a ppara agonist . the tissue-specific signals identified through this analysis appear to reiterate recent biological discoveries that appear to be unique when examined in the context of the current tcga dataset. the most significant links learned across the entire tcga cohort are a number of known cancer genes including the forkhead box transcription factor a1, p53 and estrogen receptor alpha. to perform a gene set enrichment with david on the genes involved. heatmap of the g-score ranks colored by link correlation, with red tending towards activating and blue tending towards inhibiting. for visualization purposes, interactions were filtered if they had a standard deviation 50.2 across all samples or did not have at least one tissue with a score of !0.7, resulting in 211 interactions out of the original 10 307 i67we have shown that by extending paradigm, we can combine multiple-omics data to learn the strength and sign of regulatory interactions curated from the literature. the assumption of conditional independence enables a reduction in model complexity allows efficient estimation of regulatory parameters using existing datasets, and further, and we show that the independence assumption is valid for the vast majority of regulatory programs. in addition, where the independence assumption does not hold, future extensions would be able to replace the independent factors with more complex factors that properly model a co-dependent regulatory program. when these learned parameters are applied, biological insight can be gained from simply looking at the strongest links across a cohort of samples or by looking at how interactions change between phenotypes of interest. this regulatory learning improved paradigms overall protein activity predictions, resulting in better separation of survival across clusters of ovarian cancer patients. we find that though cancer subtypes use different interactions, an interaction generally has a consistent sign whenever it is used in a particular tumor. this indicates that our current level of knowledge of cofactors as able to account for the cases where a gene switches the direction of activity. further, the concordance of our learned interaction sign and the interaction sign in databases, despite the various ways that interaction sign is annotated in the biopax language across pathway databases, indicates that pathway databases have successfully and faithfully cataloged of thousands of wetlab experiments in the literature.note: edges are identified by !, and all edges found are annotated as transcriptional activators in the pathway.
