bioimage informatics automated annotation of developmental stages of drosophila embryos in images containing spatial patterns of expression motivation: drosophila melanogaster is a major model organism for investigating the function and interconnection of animal genes in the earliest stages of embryogenesis. today, images capturing drosophila gene expression patterns are being produced at a higher throughput than ever before. the analysis of spatial patterns of gene expression is most biologically meaningful when images from a similar time point during development are compared. thus, the critical first step is to determine the developmental stage of an embryo. this information is also needed to observe and analyze expression changes over developmental time. currently, developmental stages (time) of embryos in images capturing spatial expression pattern are annotated manually, which is time-and labor-intensive. embryos are often designated into stage ranges, making the information on developmental time course. this makes downstream analyses inefficient and biological interpretations of similarities and differences in spatial expression patterns challenging, particularly when using automated tools for analyzing expression patterns of large number of images. results: here, we present a new computational approach to annotate developmental stage for drosophila embryos in the gene expression images. in an analysis of 3724 images, the new approach shows high accuracy in predicting the developmental stage correctly (79). in addition, it provides a stage score that enables one to more finely annotate each embryo so that they are divided into early and late periods of development within standard stage demarcations. stage scores for all images containing expression patterns of the same gene enable a direct way to view expression changes over developmental time for any gene. we show that the genomewide-expression-maps generated using images from embryos in refined stages illuminate global gene activities and changes much better, and more refined stage annotations improve our ability to better interpret results when expression pattern matches are discovered between genes. availability and implementation: the software package is availableincreasingly higher throughput bio-imaging technologies are enabling scientists to capture the spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression, which promises to generate a more comprehensive picture of genome function and interaction . today, gene expression and protein localization patterns are being captured with unprecedented spatial resolution in numerous model organisms. for example, more than one hundred thousand images of gene expression patterns from early embryogenesis are available for drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) . these images are a treasure trove for identifying co-expressed and coregulated genes and for tracing the changes in a genes expression over time . knowledge gained from analyses of these drosophila expression patterns is widely important because a large number of genes involved in fruit fly development are commonly found in animal kingdom . consequently, many of the inferences made from studies of fruit flies have been shown to apply to humans and other species . overall, research efforts into the spatial and temporal characteristics of gene expression patterns of drosophila have been at the leading edge of scientific investigations into the fundamental principles of animal development . the comparative analysis of gene expression patterns is most biologically meaningful when images from a similar time point are compared (campos). based on morphological landmarks, the continuous process of drosophila embryogenesis is traditionally divided into a series of stages (1, 2, , 17) . however, the standard practice of manually inspecting images containing spatial patterns is a ratelimiting step, especially when it has to be done for large number to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2013. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative

of images produced by high-throughput techniques. images generated in some high-throughput experiments are currently given stage range assignments (e.g. 46) rather than individual stages . as the original developmental stage delineations are based on major morphological events in the fruit fly development, it is, in principle, possible to distinguish embryos in images at the level of individual stages . however, previous methods only predict stage ranges, and no methods currently exist to provide specific stage annotations for drosophila embryos. furthermore, no approach currently exists to annotate developmental stage for an embryo on a continuous numerical basis, which would be more biologically realistic because development is a continuous process that is reflected in the output of the high-throughput experiments. visually, it is possible to scan a set of embryonic expressions and arrange them into a progression of gene expression, which informs us about the change and direction of spatial expression over time. this indicates need for a system that has the ability to assign more finely graded stage information that enables one to conduct biological discovery using images with higher resolution of stage similarity. in this article, we report one such computational system and show how it enhances visualization and scientific discovery.in this article, we propose an automated system for the developmental stage annotation of drosophila embryo gene expression images. a pool of 1050 classification models is constructed using a variety of state-of-the-art sparse learning algorithms. based on this model pool, we design a voting scheme which not only produces accurate stage annotation but also a stage score for each embryo. this stage score can be used to more finely annotate each embryo into early and late periods of developmental stage. we use this system to annotate 36 802 images (lateral view) from the flyexpress database, and show that the refined stage and sub-stage annotations greatly improve our ability to view global gene activities and to interpret matching expression patterns. our current system is designed for size and orientation standardized images in the flyexpress database. to extend our system for annotating non-standardized images (e.g. disoriented ones) will be an interesting future direction.three evaluation criteria are used, namely, the sub-stage accuracy (acc 0.5 ), the stage accuracy (acc stage) and the plus-minus-half accuracy (acc ae0.5 ).
