rna-skim: a rapid method for rna-seq quantification at transcript level motivation: rna-seq technique has been demonstrated as a revolutionary means for exploring transcriptome because it provides deep coverage and base pair-level resolution. rna-seq quantification is proven to be an efficient alternative to microarray technique in gene expression study, and it is a critical component in rna-seq differential expression analysis. most existing rna-seq quantification tools require the alignments of fragments to either a genome or a tran-scriptome, entailing a time-consuming and intricate alignment step. to improve the performance of rna-seq quantification, an alignment free method, sailfish, has been recently proposed to quantify transcript abundances using all k-mers in the transcriptome, demonstrating the feasibility of designing an efficient alignment-free method for transcriptome quantification. even though sailfish is substantially faster than alternative alignment-dependent methods such as cufflinks, using all k-mers in the transcriptome quantification impedes the scalability of the method. results: we propose a novel rna-seq quantification method, rna-skim, which partitions the transcriptome into disjoint transcript clusters based on sequence similarity, and introduces the notion of sig-mers, which are a special type of k-mers uniquely associated with each cluster. we demonstrate that the sig-mer counts within a cluster are sufficient for estimating transcript abundances with accuracy comparable with any state-of-the-art method. this enables rna-skim to perform transcript quantification on each cluster independently , reducing a complex optimization problem into smaller optimization tasks that can be run in parallel. as a result, rna-skim uses 54 of the k-mers and 510 of the cpu time required by sailfish. it is able to finish transcriptome quantification in 510 min per sample by using just a single thread on a commodity computer, which represents 4100 speedup over the state-of-the-art alignment-based methods, while delivering comparable or higher accuracy. availability and implementation: the software is

resolution . though rna-seq sequencing exhibits itself as an efficient alternative to microarray techniques in gene expression study , it also brings unprecedented challenges, including (but not limited to) how to rapidly and effectively process the massive data produced by the proliferation of rna-seq high-throughput sequencing, how to build statistical model for accurate quantification of transcript abundances for transcriptome, etc. most of current rna-seq tools for rna-seq quantification contain two main steps: an alignment step and a quantification step. various aligners [tophat , splicemap , mapsplice (are devised to infer the origin of each rna-seq fragment in the genome. the alignment step is usually time-consuming, requiring substantial computational resources and demanding hours to align even one individuals rna-seq data. because there are multiple variations of rna-seq sequencing techniques, e.g. single-end sequencing and paired-end sequencing, to facilitate the discussion in this article, we simply refer to the read or the pair of reads from a rna-seq fragment as a fragment. more importantly, a significant percentage of the fragments cannot be aligned without ambiguity, which yields a complicated problem in the quantification step: how to assign the ambiguous fragments to compatible transcripts and to accurately estimate the transcript abundances. to tackle the fragment multiple-assignment problem, an expectation-maximization (em) algorithm is often used to probabilistically resolve the ambiguity of fragment assignments: at each iteration, it assigns fragments to their compatible transcripts with a probability proportional to the transcript abundances, and then updates the transcript abundances to be the total weights contributed from the assigned fragments, until a convergence is reached. the em algorithms simplicity in its formulation and implementation makes it a popular choice in several rna-seq quantification methods), scripture , rsem , express (. because all fragments and all transcripts are quantified at the same time in the em algorithm, it usually requires considerable running time. some studies), mmseq (reduced the scale of the problem by collapsing reads if they can be aligned to the same set of transcripts. it is also worth mentioning that rnaseq quantification is an important first step for differential analysis on the transcript abundances among different samples . the alignment step is a vital step in the rna-seq assembly study and has become the computational bottleneck for rna-seq quantification tasks. if users are only interested in rna-seq quantification of an annotated transcriptome, aligning rna-seq fragments to the genome seems cumbersome: not only do the rna-seq aligners take a long time to align fragments to the genome by exhaustively searching all to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed

results owing to repetitive regions in the genome or sequencing errors, introducing errors in the quantification results . from another perspective, the annotation databases of transcriptome, e.g. refseq and ensembl , play an increasingly important role in rna-seq quantification. for example, tophat/cufflinks supports a mode that allows users to specify the transcriptome by supplying an annotation database (a gtf file). rsem uses bowtie a dna sequence alignerto align fragments directly to the transcriptome. aligning rna-seq fragments to transcriptome avoids the computation to detect novel splice junctions in fragments and eliminates the non-transcriptome regions in the genome from further examination, and thus reduces the total running time of the quantification method and the number of erroneous alignments in the results. to further improve the performance, the utility of k-mers was recently proposed. the concept of k-mersshort and consecutive sequences containing k nucleic acidshas been widely used in bioinformatics, including genome and transcriptome assembly , error correction in sequence reads , etc. because the number of k-mers in the genome or transcriptome is enormous when k is large (e.g. k ! 25), the need to store all k-mers impedes their counting. most of existing methods save memory usage during the computation by using sophisticated algorithms and advanced data structures [bloom filter , lockfree memory-efficient hash table , suffix array (or relying on disk space to compensate memory space . thanks to the recent advances in both annotated transcriptome and algorithms to rapidly count k-mers, the transcriptomebased alignment-free method, sailfish , requires 20 times less running time and generates comparable results with alignment-dependent quantification methods. sailfish is a lightweight method: it first builds a unique index of all k-mers that appear at least once in the transcriptome, counts the occurrences of the k-mers in the rna-seq fragments and quantifies the transcripts by the number of occurrences of the k-mers through an em algorithm. regardless of being alignment-dependent or alignment-free, all methods need to recover the fragment depththe number of fragments that cover a specific locationacross the whole transcriptome as one of the initial steps. however, none of the existing methods exploit the strong redundancy of the fragment depth in rna-seq data. more specifically,shows a strong correlation between the fragment depth of any two locations that are a certain distance apart on the transcriptome, varying the distance from 1 to 100 bp. even when the two locations are 20 bp away from each other, the pearson correlation score is still as high as 0.985. in other words, if an rna-seq quantification method that is able to recover the fragment depths for every 20 bp and quantify the abundance levels based on such information, there should be no significant accuracy loss in the result. recently, uziela and honkela (2013) developed a method that simply counts the number of alignments that covers the locations of hybridization probes used in the gene expression studies. though these probes only represent a sparse sampling on every transcript in the transcriptome, the method still provides reasonably accurate results. the observation and the method inspire us to ask the following question: what is the minimum information we need to achieve comparable accuracy in rna-seq quantification to the state-of-the-art methods? more specifically, does there exist a subset of k-mers that can provide accurate transcriptome quantification? and if so, how do we identify and use them to quantify transcriptome efficiently? to answer these questions, we introduced a special type of k-mers called sig-mers, which only appear in a (small) subset of transcripts in the transcriptome. based on these sig-mers, we developed a method, rna-skim, which is much faster than sailfish and also maintains the same level of accuracy in the results. rna-skim includes two stages, preparation and quantification. in the preparation stage, rna-skim first partitions transcripts into clusters and uses bloom filters to discover all sig-mers for each transcript cluster, from which a small yet informative subset of sig-mers is selected to be used in the quantification stage. in the quantification stage, a rolling hash method is developed to rapidly count the occurrences of the selected sig-mers, and an em algorithm is used to properly estimate the transcript abundance levels using the sigmer counts. because no sig-mer is shared by two transcript clusters, the task can be easily divided into many small quantification problems, which significantly reduces the scale of each em process and also makes it trivial to be parallelized. while rna-skim provides similar results to those of alternative methods, it only consumes 10 of the computational resources required by sailfish. in this article, we first describe the rna-skim method, then discuss how we compared rna-skim with other methods, followed by the experimental results using both simulated and real data.in this section, we first compared alternative partition algorithms and how they impact sig-mer selections in rna-skim and then furnish a comparison with four alternative methods on both simulated and real data. at last, we demonstrated that rnaskim is the fastest method among all considered methods.
