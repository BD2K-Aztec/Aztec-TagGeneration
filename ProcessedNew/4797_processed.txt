uniref clusters: a comprehensive and scalable alternative for improving sequence similarity searches motivation: uniref databases provide full-scale clustering of uniprotkb sequences and are utilized for a broad range of applications, particularly similarity-based functional annotation. non-redundancy and intra-cluster homogeneity in uniref were recently improved by adding a sequence length overlap threshold. our hypothesis is that these improvements would enhance the speed and sensitivity of similarity searches and improve the consistency of annotation within clusters. results: intra-cluster molecular function consistency was examined by analysis of gene ontology terms. results show that uniref clusters bring together proteins of identical molecular function in more than 97 of the clusters, implying that clusters are useful for annotation and can also be used to detect annotation inconsistencies. to examine coverage in similarity results, blastp searches against uniref50 followed by expansion of the hit lists with cluster members demonstrated advantages compared with searches against uniprotkb sequences; the searches are concise ($7 times shorter hit list before expansion), faster ($6 times) and more sensitive in detection of remote similarities (96 recall at e-value 0.0001). our results support the use of uniref clusters as a comprehensive and scalable alternative to native sequence databases for similarity searches and reinforces its reliability for use in functional annotation. availability and implementation: web access and file download from uniprot website atthe uniref databases (uniprot reference clusters) provide clustered sets of sequences from the uniprot knowledgebase and selected uniparc records to obtain complete coverage of sequence space at several resolutions (100, 90 and 50 identity) while hiding redundant sequences . the uniref100 database combines identical sequences and subfragments from any source organism into a single uniref entry (i.e. cluster). uniref90 and uniref50 are built by clustering uniref100 sequences at the 90 or 50 sequence identity levels. uniref entries contain v c the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.932 doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu739 advance access publication date: 13 november 2014 original paper summary cluster and membership information, including the sequence of a representative (best-annotated) protein, member count and common taxonomy of the cluster, the accession numbers of all the merged entries and links to rich functional annotation in uniprotkb to facilitate biological discovery. the uniref databases have been produced for 10 years and are used worldwide for a broad range of applications. since first released in 2004, uniref has been cited over 400 times based on google scholar and unique citations from pubmed central. unirefs ability to reduce redundancy while preserving information on source and quality annotation has proven useful in many studies based on the citation analysis. the most common uses of uniref databases continue to be in functional annotation, family classification, systems biology, structural genomics, phylogenetic analysis and mass spectrometry. recent studies have also used uniref for improving protein sequence alignments through homology extension , increasing sequence search sensitivity with transitive alignments , developing representative proteomes and proteome clusters , predicting the functional effects of disease variants , performing functional screening of metagenomics data , developing large-scale hierarchical clustering algorithms , studying gene duplication and conducting genomic studies of peptide and oligonucleotide frequencies . based on the uniprot usage statistics, uniref web pages receive approximately 200 000 hits per month. the uniref file download has been increasing steadily since its inception with an annual growth rate of 20 in recent years, now reaching more than 3000 annual unique ip downloads. in this article, we present analysis of two additional qualities of uniref databases: that clusters bring together proteins with similar to identical functional annotation and that similarity searches are faster and as sensitive as searches on native sequence databases. we also provide an update on uniref database production and coverage.
