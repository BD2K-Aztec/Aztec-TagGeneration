gene expression samexplorer: exploring reproducibility and robustness of rna-seq results based on sam files motivation: data from rna-seq experiments provide us with many new possibilities to gain insights into biological and disease mechanisms of cellular functioning. however, the reproducibility and robustness of rna-seq data analysis results is often unclear. this is in part attributed to the two counter acting goals of (i) a cost efficient and (ii) an optimal experimental design leading to a compromise, e.g. in the sequencing depth of experiments. results: we introduce an r package called samexplorer that allows the subsampling (m out of n bootstraping) of short-reads based on sam files facilitating the investigation of sequencing depth related questions for the experimental design. overall, this provides a systematic way for exploring the reproducibility and robustness of general rna-seq studies. we exemplify the usage of samexplorer by studying the influence of the sequencing depth and the annotation on the identification of differentially expressed genes. availability and implementation: samexplorer is available as an r package from bioconductor.rna-seq data generated with nextgeneration sequencing (ngs) platforms are offering many new and exciting opportunities from basic biology to translational clinical research. however, one important problem that have these diverse applications in common is the question regarding the reproducibility and the robustness of obtained results . due to the novelty of rna-seq data, there are so far only a few studies investigating either the optimal sequencing depth in general v c the author 2016. published by oxford university press. all rights reserved. for permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com or for context specific problems, e.g. for identifying differentially expressed (de) genes . in this paper, we introduce an r package called samexplorer that allows the convenient exploration of reproducibility and robustness of rna-seq data analysis results. we demonstrate the utility of samexplorer by a case study for identifying de genes.to demonstrate the applicability of samexplorer for studying reproducibility and robustness we use an rna-seq dataset from mus musculus (mouse) . this dataset consists of two groups with three samples in each. aligning was performed with bowtie2 allowing 1 mismatch. for our analysis, we consider three different annotations . for obtaining information about the robustness and reproducibility of this dataset w.r.t. different metrics, we draw m out of n bootstrap short reads from the original sam files, whereas f m=n corresponds to the fraction of subsampled reads, i.e. f : fraction of subsampled reads subsampled reads total reads :the parameter f has the interpretation of a simulated sequencing depth of a virtual sequencing experiment. furthermore, for every value of f, we generate r 25 replicates (see loop in). each of these datasets is then analyzed with deseq2 to obtain a list of de genes. in.a, we show the number of de genes (y-axis) as a function of the simulated sequencing depth, f, (x-axis) for three annotations. the three included p-values correspond to results from a friedman test for dependent groups, comparing the results from r 3 user-specified values of f (horizontal slices; see arrows) for a fixed annotation, testing the null hypothesis of equal means. ideally, a nonsignificant friedman test corresponds to statistically robust results because a further increase of the (real) sequencing depth is unlikely to change the results. practically, the friedman test may give significant results indicating an imperfection in the robustness of the results w.r.t. variations of the parameter f, as is the case for the examples in.a. next, we study the reproducibility of different annotations for fixed f values (vertical slices; see arrows). as one can see from.a, the results for different annotations are diverging for increasing values of f making the results less reproducible w.r.t. different genome annotations. the choice of f values is explored in the suppl.file in order to emphasize that robustness as well as reproducibility are always defined w.r.t. to a specific metric, we repeat the above analysis for the common number of de genes between two annotations; results shown in.b. further questions that could be studied with samexplorer in a similar way would be the reproducibility of results of rna-seq data from different wet labs, sequencing platforms, gene summarizations (including introns), tissue preparations (ffpe versus ff samples) or statistical analysis methods. also the robustness of the summarization parameter for multiple gene hits or the number of mismatches for the alignments could be explored.a cornerstone of any scientific study is the question regarding the reproducibility and robustness of obtained results. unfortunately, for high-throughput data from rna-seq experiments such questionsare highly non-trivial to answer, which may be an explanation for the severe underrepresentation of this topic in the literature. samexplorer provides a flexible exploratory tool for investigating general rna-seq datasets w.r.t. user-defined metrics.
