sequence analysis rvboost: rna-seq variants prioritization using a boosting method motivation: rna-seq has become the method of choice to quantify genes and exons, discover novel transcripts and detect fusion genes. however, reliable variant identification from rna-seq data remains challenging because of the complexities of the transcriptome, the challenges of accurately mapping exon boundary spanning reads and the bias introduced during the sequencing library preparation. method: we developed rvboost, a novel method specific for rna variant prioritization. rvboost uses several attributes unique in the process of rna library preparation, sequencing and rna-seq data analyses. it uses a boosting method to train a model of good quality variants using common variants from hapmap, and prioritizes and calls the rna variants based on the trained model. we packaged rvboost in a comprehensive workflow, which integrates tools of variant calling, annotation and filtering. results: rvboost consistently outperforms the variant quality score recalibration from the genome analysis tool kit and the rna-seq variant-calling pipeline snpir in 12 rna-seq samples using ground-truth variants from paired exome sequencing data. several rna-seqspecific attributes were identified as critical to differentiate true and false variants, including the distance of the variant positions to exon boundaries, and the percent of the reads supporting the variant in the first six base pairs. the latter identifies false variants introduced by the random hexamer priming during the library construction. availability and implementation: the rvboost package is implemented to readily run in mac or linux environments. the software and user manual are available at http://bioinformaticstools.mayo. edu/research/rvboost/.rna-seq has become popular with the decreasing cost and its potential to quantify exon/transcript levels over a large dynamic range, discover novel transcripts, identify various splicing mechanisms and detect fusion genes . however, while the variant identification from dna sequencing is becoming a routine practice, the variant detection from rna-seq remains challenging because of the complexity of the transcriptome, the ambiguities in mapping exon boundary spanning reads and the artifacts introduced in rna-seq library protocols . because expressed genetic variants have more immediate impact on the protein function compared with the dna variants, we were motivated to develop a reliable rna-seq variant prioritization method. in general, variant detection from massive parallel sequencing data involves two steps. first is variant calling, which outputs all positions with any evidence of alternative alleles compared with reference. an essential next step is variant prioritization and filtering to obtain reliable variants of high confidence. for dna sequencing data, the most widely used variant prioritization method is a mixture model-based classifier, variant quality score recalibration (vqsr), within the genome analysis toolkit (gatk) . vqsr integrates multiple attributes/annotations of the variants, all of which are based on features of sequencing, including the depth of coverage, strand bias, mapping qualities and variant position bias toward the end of the reads. vqsr uses variants reported in hapmap as the training source to calculate a filtering criterion, and then predicts true novel variants. another method snpir proposes a series of arbitrary hard thresholds to filter and reduce the number of false variants . after careful examination of the rna-seq variant detection process, we proposed to include rna-specific attributes/annotations for the variant prioritization model in addition to the features included in gatk. furthermore, we observed that the gaussian mixture model and the parameter selection used in vqsr are not ideal for modeling these features and proposed to use a boosting method that uses generalized linear models as its base learners. this method, called the rna variant boosting (rvboost), is a ranking machine to (a) train a model based on common variants in hapmap and (b) rank the variants accordingly. to whom correspondence should be addressed. y the authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first two authors should be regarded as joint first

this workflow outputs called variants with detailed annotations in both the standard variant calling format (vcf) and the tab-delimited text format. we have shown that rvboost outperforms vqsr in 12 rnaseq samples with paired exome sequencing data. we also introduced a key concept of train-set quantile score, or the train-q score, to help users determine their preferred precision/recall trade-off.
