structural bioinformatics automated bond order assignment as an optimization problem motivation: numerous applications in computational biology process molecular structures and hence strongly rely not only on correct atomic coordinates but also on correct bond order information. for proteins and nucleic acids, bond orders can be easily deduced but this does not hold for other types of molecules like ligands. for ligands, bond order information is not always provided in molecular databases and thus a variety of approaches tackling this problem have been developed. in this work, we extend an ansatz proposed by wang et al. that assigns connectivity-based penalty scores and tries to heuristically approximate its optimum. in this work, we present three efficient and exact solvers for the problem replacing the heuristic approximation scheme of the original approach: an a, an ilp and an fixed-parameter approach (fpt) approach. results: we implemented and evaluated the original implementation , our a, ilp and fpt formulation on the mmff94 validation suite and the kegg drug database. we show the benefit of computing exact solutions of the penalty minimization problem and the additional gain when computing all optimal (or even suboptimal) solutions. we close with a detailed comparison of our methods. availability: the a and ilp solution are integrated into the open-source c++ lgpl library ball and the molecular visualization and modelling tool ballview and can be downloaded from our homepage www.ball-project.org. the fpt implementation can be downloaded fromcorrect bond order information is essential for many algorithms in computational structural biology and theoretical chemistry, since bonds do not only define the connectivity of atoms in a molecule but also define structural aspects like rotatability of individual parts. however, bond order information can often not be directly inferred from the available experimental data. even important molecular databases, like the protein data bank (pdb) and the cambridge structural database , are known to contain erroneous data for connectivity and bond to whom correspondence should be addressed. order information or to even omit them entirely. for proteins and nucleic acids, bond orders can be easily deduced due to their building block nature, but this does not hold for other kinds of molecules like ligands. the problem is made much worse by the fact that quite often, the bond order assignment for a given molecule is not unique, even when neglecting symmetries in the molecule. the chemical reasons for this effect are complex and out of scope of this work; here we just want to state that the concept of integer bond orders is only an approximation to a full quantum chemical treatment, and cannot explain all effects occurring in molecules. important examples are aromatic or delocalized bonds, leading to different resonance structures (cf.). in addition, formal charges are often not contained in the input files, but atoms carrying a formal charge will obviously show a different bonding pattern. one body of opinion tries to overcome these obstacles by hand curation, which clearly provides the highest reliability. on the other hand, manual data curation does not scale well to large numbers of molecules, and it does not help in conditions where modifications are systematically applied to molecules, e.g. in computational combinatorial chemistry. in the past decades, the problem of assigning bond orders automatically has been addressed by a number of different approaches. early methods in the field strongly rely on the correctness of atomic coordinates and focus on reference bond lengths and valence angles or additionally consider functional group detection and further molecular features like hybridization states and charges . the main drawbacks of those approaches are the dependence on correct atomic coordinates and the algorithms heuristic nature. in contrast, exact solvers proposed previously represent the bond order assignment problem as a maximum weighted matching for non-bipartite graphs or as an integer linear programming problem that generates valid lewis structures (electron dot structures) with minimal formal charge on each atom . recently,have presented an elegant novel approach to the problem, which is implemented in the established antechamber package, a suite of tools used for the preparation of input structures for molecular mechanics studies. in this approach, a chemically motivated, expert generated penalty function is used to score bond order assignments. this function is then heuristically optimized. however, this procedure has two drawbacks: the score of a resulting assignment is not guaranteed to be optimal and the algorithm provides only one solution while there can be more than one assignment with optimal score.exemplarily. top: different co-optimal bond order assignments. in the left structure, both nh 2 groups are connected via a single bond and thus freely rotatable. in the middle and right structure, one group is connected via a double bond. bottom: heuristic and optimal bond order assignments. the left structure is the solution provided by antechamber with a tps of 4. its 5-ring does not fulfill the aromaticity criterion of am1-bcc . the right structure is the solution computed with our exact solvers. its tps is 0 and the 5-ring meets the am1-bcc aromaticity criterion.shows two cases where theses two drawbacks may lead to a wrong interpretation of molecular properties (flexibility and aromaticity). unfortunately, the optimization problem introduced byis np-hard . in this work, we propose three exact approaches that solve the problem to provable global optimality by discrete optimization techniques: we give an integer linear program (ipl) formulation, and an a approach and a fixedparameter algorithm for enumerating all optimal or, if desired, all feasible solutions. in addition, our approach can easily be extended to, e.g. include structural information, add missing hydrogens or even missing bonds. the a and ilp solution are integrated into the opensource c++ lgpl library ball  and the molecular visualization and modelling tool ballview and can be downloaded from our homepage www.ball-project.org. the fpt implementation can be downloaded from http://bio.informatik .unijena.de/software/.for proteins and dna, bond orders can be simply inferred by matching the given state to a database containing the bond orders for all amino acids and nucleotides. hence, we focus the evaluation of our algorithms on small and medium-sized molecules (for instance, drug-like molecules). such molecules can be found in large numbers in several established ligand databases, such as zinc , astex , kegg ligand and kegg drug , the mmff94 validation suite or the cambridge structural database . but evaluating the correctness of our bond order algorithms poses certain constraints: we need ligand structures that contain not only the connectivity information but also preassigned bond orders and explicit hydrogens. as a further requirement, aromatic bonds should be given in kekulized form, i.e. replaced by a suitable pattern of single and double bonds. in contrast to structure-based bond assignment approaches, however, we can use databases that contain 3d ligand structures as well as those only storing structure diagrams or smiles expressions. to provide a diverse test dataset fulfilling those constraints, we chose the mmff94 validation suite and the kegg drug database to provide our ground truth. the mmff94 validation suite provides 761 small drug-like molecules, mainly derived from the cambridge structural database . the molecules were thoroughly prepared by the authors of the mmff94 force field by assigning bond orders, adding hydrogens where valences had to be completed, and minimizing the resulting complexes. the mmff94 validation suite was originally designed to test the mmff94 force field parameters, and thus yields a diverse set of molecules with hand-curated connectivity information, hydrogens and bond order assignment and 3d positions that we found very reasonable for testing bond order perception. the kegg drug database , provided by the kanehisa laboratories, offers a remarkable number of drug-like molecules for diverse applications in bioinformatics. the atoms molecular coordinates are 2d, which is suitable for representation by structure diagrams, but is unsuited for structure-based bond order assignment as performed by most of the former approaches. it thus represents a perfect test scenario for bond order assignment from topology alone. unfortunately, hydrogens are missing in the kegg data bases, and were added for our tests using standard rules for completing free valences as performed by openbabel . furthermore, 2550 files of the kegg drug set contain more than one molecule, and each molecule may appear in more than one file. to prevent a skewed analysis, we split up the dataset into unique connected components. ignoring molecules with less than four atoms (e.g. water), this preparation led to a test set of 7424 molecules from the kegg drug set. in section 4.1, we compare the total penalty score tps of the results of our exact solvers with that of the results of the original antechamber approach. in section 4.2, we compare the results of the different approaches to the expert generated, hand-crafted reference assignments and study the implications of the ambiguity of two or more co-optimal solutions. all algorithmsa, ilp, fpt and antechamberare applied to the two test sets such as mmff94 and kegg drug. computing all optimal solutions for all 761 molecules of the mmff94 dataset, the total running time was 252.0 s for the ilp, 227.1 s for the a algorithm and 24.9 s for the fpt algorithm. the antechamber heuristic took 7.9 s to compute one solution for all molecules (cf. supplementary material). all reported running times were averaged over 20 repetitions. thus, the ability to provide all optimal exact solutions and to use user-editable smarts strings for penalty class assignment takes its toll: the heuristic antechamber approach is the fastest of the methods, about an order of magnitude faster than ilp and a. still, all running times are sufficiently small to allow the routine usage in high-throughput applications.automated bond order assignment is an important problem when working with user-generated molecules, molecular databases or computational combinatorial chemistry. especially fully automated pipelines in high-throughput applications depend on reliable bond order assignments. the modern and extensible approach realized in antechamber is based on sound chemical principles and has proven to be a very valuable tool. in this work, we have shown three different exact solvers as alternatives to the heuristic approach pursued by: an a algorithm, an ilp formulation and a fixed parameter approach. while we found in our evaluations that the heuristic solver works surprisingly wellroughly 97 of all cases in our testsit still can be significantly improved using exact techniques. if we keep in mind that bond order assignments are in many cases non-uniquedifferent resonance structures, for instance, might have the same probability to occurthe ability to systematically enumerate all solutions becomes an invaluable tool. when bond order assignments are important, it might be worthwhile to enumerate all optimal assignments, run whatever procedure is supposed to work with the results in the next step, and average over the results. comparing the three different exact strategies, each of them has its advantages and disadvantages. if computational efficiency is required, the best choice is clearly the fpt, where running times are almost on par with the antechamber heuristic. the a algorithm, on the other hand, is even simpler to implement than the heuristic and can be very easily extended through the heuristic cost function. both approaches can compute co-optimal
