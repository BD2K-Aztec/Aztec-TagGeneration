mutadelic: mutation analysis using description logic inferencing capabilities motivation: as next generation sequencing gains a foothold in clinical genetics, there is a need for annotation tools to characterize increasing amounts of patient variant data for identifying clinically relevant mutations. while existing informatics tools provide efficient bulk variant annotations, they often generate excess information that may limit their scalability. results: we propose an alternative solution based on description logic inferencing to generate workflows that produce only those annotations that will contribute to the interpretation of each variant. workflows are dynamically generated using a novel abductive reasoning framework called a basic framework for abductive workflow generation (abfab). criteria for identifying disease-causing variants in mendelian blood disorders were identified and implemented as abfab services. a web application was built allowing users to run workflows generated from the criteria to analyze genomic variants. significant variants are flagged and explanations provided for why they match or fail to match the criteria. availability and implementation: the mutadelic web application is available for use at http://distinguishing harmful from benign variants in clinical exome or whole genome sequencing is comprised of two steps: variant annotation and interpretation. annotation involves the labeling of variants with diverse features, including population frequencies and effect on amino acid composition, which then guide interpretation for finding variants with damaging effect on protein function (what we call variant prioritization). there are several annotation systems that assist medical geneticists in the prioritization of a patients variants. some of the existing systems, including annovar and vax , can accommodate custom annotations for guiding a geneticists decision process. as most annotations can be precomputed and efficiently retrieved, these systems can rapidly annotate most or all variants in a human genome.while these existing systems are an invaluable tool for medical geneticists, they do have some shortcomings. first, they do not address the need to accommodate several variant filters based on disease-, and often expert-dependent interpretation rules. second, as some annotations cannot be easily pre-computed, like complex indels, or substrate binding properties, the computational cost of generating annotation for all observed variants is high. third, as the number of annotations increases, storing the complete set of annotations for all variants is progressively costly. fourth, as data resources are changing over time, there is a need to recompute the entire set of variants for retrieving the most current annotations. fifth, there is little emphasis on using standards or provenance when generating variant annotations. what we propose in this article is a fresh look at how we perform variant prioritization. rather than annotating all observedvariants, with subsequent interpretation, we propose to merge the two steps into a single process that reduces the necessary annotations to the minimum number necessary. to do so, we borrow from prior work in semantic workflows, and related fields such as hierarchical task network planning. in essence, we allow geneticist to formulate an objective (identify variants with a particular annotation combination), which is sufficient to generate an efficient plan for a series of annotation steps (a workflow) to which each variant is subjected. if at any point in the workflow it is determined that the objective cannot be reached, the variant under consideration is dropped from further consideration. using smart workflow planning, computationally cheap annotation steps are front-loaded. for example, if the objective states that the geneticist is interested in variants with a specific population frequency only (a simple database lookup), many variants with higher frequency can be discarded at an early stage and do not need further annotations. if a workflow completes successfully, only the absolute necessary annotations were computed to reach the objective. using elements from semantic workflow research, we treat each annotation step as a separate service with semantically defined input and output criteria. the use of a service-oriented architecture has distinct advantages; among them a straightforward procedure for determining whether a variant needs re-computing. for example, only variants that have been subjected to a particular annotation service need re-processing if the service is updated. finally, the use of a coherent semantic framework, expressed in rdf/owl, is not only helpful in workflow planning, but also for defining diverse sets of annotation objectives, for generating a provenance trail, and to link annotated variants to other resources using constrained data elements.the most notable disorders of red cell membranes in humans are hereditary spherocytosis (hs), hereditary elliptocytosis (he) and hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (hpp). they are inherited disorders, marked by genetic heterogeneity, that are linked to hemolytic anemia . hs is characterized by erythrocytes that are spherical in shape rather than the expected olive-shaped conformation . hs is a fairly common disorder, especially among northern european populations where it occurs in 1:10002500 individuals. it most frequently manifests itself in the form of mild to moderate anemia, although severe anemia can occur in some cases. hs is characterized by mutations in the following genes: ank1 (ankyrin 1, erythrocytic), slc4a1 (solute carrier family 4, anion exchanger, member 1 [erythrocyte membrane protein band 3, diego blood group)], sptb (spectrin, beta, erythrocytic), spta1 [spectrin, alpha, erythrocytic 1 (elliptocytosis)] and epb42 (erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.2). of these five, mutations in ank1 are most frequent, followed by slc4a1 and sptb . he results in elongated, cigar-shaped erythrocytes. it is most frequently asymptomatic but will occasionally lead to mild or even severe anemia . it is also fairly common (1:20004000), with higher incidence in african populations (estimated as high as 1:100). hpp is related to he but is much more severe. it is characterized by large numbers of fragmented and misshapen erythrocytes and results in severe hemolytic anemia. mutations in spta1, sptb and epb42 are associated with he and hpp, with spt1 being the most frequent. most documented mutations modify the self-association regions of spectrin proteins which causes damage to cell membrane structure .this work discusses clinical variant prioritization using dl reasoning, and bears similarities to existing ideas from the fields of semantic workflow generation, and related fields such as hierarchical task network planning. the key elements of our approach, in short, are the ability to express a goal or objective, and a system that decides whether an observed individual (variant) complies with the objective. to do so, we need, in a staging phase, means to automatically chain together existing variant annotation services, using semantic descriptions of these services. there is extensive prior work in this area , with several formalisms for web service description available, such as swasdl . there exists integrated systems that perform workflow generation based on such descriptions, including the wings system or taverna . these existing formalisms and systems are generic, and can be applied to diverse domains and research areas. unlike wings, which supports automated workflow generation, but delegates service execution to external systems such as pegasus , our system integrates workflow planning and execution in one formalism. while tavernas emphasis is less on automated workflow generation, it integrates workflow planning and execution in one platform. both systems do not provide the second requirement of our system, which uses instance checking to determine whether the output of a workflow (once executed), corresponds to some stated objective. there is some prior work that uses hierarchical task network (htn) planning on top of semantic web service descriptions, to achieve a similar goal. however, the described work is based on an existing task planning system, called shop2 , which is not easily applicable to the rdf/owl formalism used in our project. in the bioinformatics domain, our approach is similar to the semantic automated discovery and integration (sadi) framework . sadi describes web services for processing biomedical data in owl. as inabfab, owl classes with restrictions on input and output are used to model services. the semantic health and research environment (share) sparql query client also functions by connecting services to form a path of execution. mutadelic/abfab and sadi/ share differ however in terms of their focus and their means of implementing service paths. the focus of the share is on answering queries where data is spread out across multiple locations. abfab focuses instead on generation of workflows to process data where services are defined locally. share matches services based upon whether execution of them adds the predicate requested by the query to the kb . abfab uses consistency checking to determine fulfillment of input and output constraints. this approach allows for more flexible matching and it does not require the user to know the specifics of what triples services add to the kb. the share method requires that a step be executed before the next step may be determined. abfab generates the full path before execution, potentially saving considerable expense if a path to the goal criteria cannot be reached. abfab also offers the additional features of a cost-based determination of optimal path and structures (branches and conditions) to support complex paths. the ability to change execution flow based upon runtime output allows abfab to support use cases beyond workflow generation, including decision trees and the sort of query answering targeted by sadi/share. due to their similar structure, it would be relatively straightforward to create abfab services that act as wrappers for sadi services. the criteria used to highlight mutations of interest in mutadelic represents a single expert view on mutation prioritization within a particular context, in this case mendelian blood disorders. different criteria could be applied to the same context or criteria could be established for different contexts, e.g. a different disease or family of diseases. it is easy to imagine a scenario in which multiple criteria co-exist. in such a scenario, researchers could compare different methodologies for the same context or analyze patient data from multiple contexts. to do so, we hope, in the near future, to provide a ui framework to allow users to define their own criteria to identify significant variations. this would facilitate comparison of approaches to variant prioritization. the challenge would be creating a user-friendly interface with the owl representation of the logical constraints. this would be achieved using the current set of defined services allowing for (i) modification of the faceted restrictions (e.g. changing significant sift value from 0.05 to 0.01) and(ii) different combinations of conjunction, disjunction and negation (and, or and not). another optimization would be a framework, either a ui tool or an api for definition of new service classes. again, there is the challenge of hiding the complexity of owl representation from the user/developer.this article describes a new variant annotation paradigm that is based on the idea of generating the minimum necessary annotations for reaching a diagnostically relevant conclusion. it is a departure from existing solutions, which seek to annotate all observed variants. it is also, to our knowledge, the first attempt to use semantic workflows and abductive reasoning for this purpose. we believe that our solution will contribute to a more scalable informatics infrastructure that is appropriate for next-generation sequencingbased clinical genetics.
