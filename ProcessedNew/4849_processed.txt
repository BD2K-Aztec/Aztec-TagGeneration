genetics and population analysis vcf2networks: applying genotype networks to single-nucleotide variants data a wealth of large-scale genome sequencing projects opens the doors to new approaches to study the relationship between genotype and phenotype. one such opportunity is the possibility to apply genotype networks analysis to population genetics data. genotype networks are a representation of the set of genotypes associated with a single phenotype, and they allow one to estimate properties such as the robustness of the phenotype to mutations, and the ability of its associated genotypes to evolve new adaptations. so far, though, genotype networks analysis has rarely been applied to population genetics data. to help fill this gap, here we present vcf2networks, a tool to determine and study genotype network structure from single-nucleotide variant data.genotype networks can be used to describe the evolutionary properties of a set of genotypes associated with a qualitative phenotype. they are derived from genotypephenotype maps, and have been used in a wide range of systems, from genetic circuits , to rna folding , and to metabolic networks (matias rodrigues and wagner 2009). in these cases, genotype networks were used to predict the robustness of a phenotype to mutations, and the potential of the underlying genotypes to evolve new and innovative traits. there have so far been few applications of methods based on genotypephenotype maps to empirical data , even though the advent of new sequencing technologies provides large datasets of genotype data associated with phenotypes. to take advantage of such datasets, we developed vcf2networks, a tool to apply genotype networks analysis to next-generation sequencing data. the tool permits the determination of genomic regions with high robustness of a given phenotype, i.e. mutations in this region affect the phenotype little or have high potential to create novel phenotypes.
