systems biology near-optimal experimental design for model selection in systems biology motivation: biological systems are understood through iterations of modeling and experimentation. not all experiments, however, are equally valuable for predictive modeling. this study introduces an efficient method for experimental design aimed at selecting dynamical models from data. motivated by biological applications, the method enables the design of crucial experiments: it determines a highly informative selection of measurement readouts and time points. results: we demonstrate formal guarantees of design efficiency on the basis of previous results. by reducing our task to the setting of graphical models, we prove that the method finds a near-optimal design selection with a polynomial number of evaluations. moreover, the method exhibits the best polynomial-complexity constant approximation factor, unless p np. we measure the performance of the method in comparison with established alternatives, such as ensemble non-centrality, on example models of different complexity. efficient design accelerates the loop between modeling and experimentation: it enables the inference of complex mechanisms, such as those controlling central metabolic operation. availability: toolbox nearoed available with source code under gpl on the machine learning open source software web siteat the present level of development, investigations in biology require setting up complicated and expensive experiments . advances in measurement techniques prompted the recent growth of detailed mathematical models, which capture biological phenomena at different levels of detail. however, the employment of novel measurement techniques by itself is insufficient to achieve high predictive power. experimental design provides the necessary guidance to determine crucial observations. often, in fact, an important task is the selection of the most informative experiments. in systems biology, dynamical models express causeeffect relations between interacting components . designing optimal experiments for parameter estimation is challenging, but also well studied. at present, there already exist conclusive results and ready-to-use procedures . in contrast, modern research often consists of discriminating between alternative models , a task for which several questions remain open . design optimization for the selection of dynamic models proves especially challenging in the presence of nonlinear behavior . in classical statistics, ensemble non-centrality constitutes the reference technique to design experiments for model selection (; ponce de). recently, bayesian techniques have been applied with success to neuroimaging and biochemical modeling . existing methods are primarily limited by computational bottlenecks, as optimization is often practically intractable. this study introduces an efficient method to design informative experiments for selecting biological dynamical systems. building on previous results , we go beyond current limitations by constructing a method that yields near-optimal combinations of time points and measurable readouts. formal efficiency guarantees of the method are proved by reduction to a well-studied general setting . the method is generally applicable and has been primarily motivated by questions arising from the biological domain. we empirically evaluate the performance of the method with models of glucose tolerance and cell signaling. we apply the method to address challenging open problems of biological and medical relevance. the manuscript is organized as follows. we start by introducing relevant facts and notions to be used in the rest of the article. theoretical results are followed by empirical evaluation and numerical comparison with competing techniques. finally, the method is evaluated and verified with glucose tolerance and cell signaling. further details are presented in the supplementary material. to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2013. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.in a complex field in which noisy data and expensive experiments constitute the norm, it is crucial to guide experimentation through rational design. here, our main contribution is the introduction of a method that guarantees high informativeness with a polynomial number of evaluations of the information objective. the main motivation of this study is biological, but it is worth noting that the presented results for readout and time point selection are applicable to general dynamical systems. as a consequence of previous results from submodular optimization , we could prove that the greedy method exhibits the best constant approximation factor (unless p np) to design experiments for the selection among alternative dynamical systems. this study proves that entirely rational selections can be made a priori with efficiency and solely on the basis of the accumulated domain knowledge. reported results show that near-optimal experiments are effectively optimal in the application to glucose tolerance. the method outperforms the available alternatives in terms of empirical success rate, as shown for tor modeling. in a practical application, we used the method presented here in a study revealing nuclear phosphorylation as the key control mechanism for the transcription factor msn2 on stress release in saccharomyces cerevisiae . by optimization of equation (10), the experimental design was targeted to enable informative selection among 12 models representing various hypothetical mechanisms for the short-term msn2 dynamics. in this application, the combination of experimental design and model selection led to identification, and prediction, of previously unknown and potentially generic principles for transcription factor dynamics . a distinct but relevant question remains open: how to reliably identify the parameters of the candidate models? this issue goes beyond the scope of this study, as it strictly belongs to the domain of system identification . at the same time, it is an aspect that deserves special attention, as design and modeling are part of the same hypothetico-deductive process. we conclude that the introduced method may be useful to guide intuition through quantitative indicators and thus accelerate scientific discovery.
