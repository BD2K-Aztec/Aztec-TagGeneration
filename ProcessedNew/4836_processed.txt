genome analysis vague: a graphical user interface for the velvet assembler velvet is a popular open-source de novo genome assembly software tool, which is run from the unix command line. most of the problems experienced by new users of velvet revolve around constructing syntactically and semantically correct command lines, getting input files into acceptable formats and assessing the output. here, we present velvet assembler graphical user environment (vague), a multi-platform graphical front-end for velvet. vague aims to make sequence assembly accessible to a wider audience and to facilitate better usage amongst existing users of velvet.velvet was one of the first de novo genome assemblers, which handled short read sequences from the original illumina genome analyzer . it has become popular because it is relatively simple to install, has no dependencies, produces good results, runs fast and has a strong user community . the main drawback of velvet is its complex command line interface. projects consisting of multiple sequence libraries are challenging to specify correctly. the user needs to provide the exact file format and compression type of the input sequence files. standard paired-end read files need to be interleaved manually beforehand. to address these and other issues, we developed velvet assembler graphical user environment (vague), a graphical user interface to velvet.
