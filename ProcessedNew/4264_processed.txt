data and text mining simultaneous recognition and segmentation of cells: application in c.elegans motivation: automatic recognition of cell identities is critical for quantitative measurement, targeting and manipulation of cells of model animals at single-cell resolution. it has been shown to be a powerful tool for studying gene expression and regulation, cell lineages and cell fates. existing methods first segment cells, before applying a recognition algorithm in the second step. as a result, the segmentation errors in the first step directly affect and complicate the subsequent cell recognition step. moreover, in new experimental settings, some of the image features that have been previously relied upon to recognize cells may not be easy to reproduce, due to limitations on the number of color channels available for fluorescent imaging or to the cost of building transgenic animals. an approach that is more accurate and relies on only a single signal channel is clearly desirable. results: we have developed a new method, called simultaneous recognition and segmentation (srs) of cells, and applied it to 3d image stacks of the model organism caenorhabditis elegans. given a 3d image stack of the animal and a 3d atlas of target cells, srs is effectively an atlas-guided voxel classification process: cell recognition is realized by smoothly deforming the atlas to best fit the image, where the segmentation is obtained naturally via classification of all image voxels. the method achieved a 97.7 overall recognition accuracy in recognizing a key class of marker cells, the body wall muscle (bwm) cells, on a dataset of 175 c.elegans image stacks containing 14 118 manually curated bwm cells providing the ground-truth for accuracy. this result was achieved without any additional fiducial image features. srs also automatically identified 14 of the image stacks as involving 90 rotations. with these stacks excluded from the dataset, the recognition accuracy rose to 99.1. we also show srs is generally applicable to other cell types, e.g. intestinal cells. availability: the supplementary movies can be downloaded from our web site http://penglab.janelia.org/proj/celegans_seganno. the method has been implemented as a plug-in program within the v3d system (http://penglab.janelia.org/proj/v3d), and will be released in the v3d plugin source code repository. contact:one of the promises of bioimage informatics is to quantitatively measure and accurately target single cells, thus facilitating improved throughput for genetic and phenotypic assays . a number of 3d cell and gene expression image segmentation, recognition and tracking techniques have been developed and applied to widely used model animals, including caenorhabditis elegans , fruit fly and zebrafish . caenorhabditis elegans is well known for its invariant lineage and the unique identities of its cells. single-cell image recognition and tracking techniques for this animal have led to a deeper understanding of the genetic signatures of cells, and the relationship between cell lineage and cell types . this article focuses on a new method for recognizing and segmenting c.elegans cells that is more reliable and applicable to more sample protocols. existing image analysis pipelines for single-cell resolution studies typically start with a segmentation of the cells in a 3d image, followed by an ad hoc recognition or tracking process. it is typically hard to ensure an error-free segmentation of cells in an image sample, especially when (i) the image has an uneven background or low signal to noise ratio, or (ii) nuclei are so crowded as to touch each or have irregular morphology. our experience is that segmentation errors promote errors in the subsequent recognition task in a non-additive fashion. in addition, within this previous framework, useful prior information, such as the relative location relationship of cells, and useful statistics from the recognition phase, such as discrepancies between the predicted and a priori cells locations, are hard to incorporate in a way that improves the overall analysis. in addition, for a variety of experimental settings, it may be difficult to generate some of the currently used fiducial image features that are critical for accurately recognizing cells. for example, in the l1 larval stage of c.elegans, there are 81 body wall muscle (bwm) cells. these cells form four nearly symmetrical bundles, each of which has 20 or so cells in one of the ventral-left, ventral-right, dorsal-left and dorsal-right quadrants. recognizing these bwm cells is critical because they can serve as additional fiducial points for recognizing other cells in the animal. in experiments using fixed animals (e.g.) that also stain all nuclei, one can recognize these four bundles based on the asymmetry of the distribution of other cells (e.g. the 15 ventral
