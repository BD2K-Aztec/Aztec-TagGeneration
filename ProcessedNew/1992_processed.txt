genome analysis genetalk: an expert exchange platform for assessing rare sequence variants in personal genomes next-generation sequencing has become a powerful tool in personalized medicine. exomes or even whole genomes of patients suffering from rare diseases are screened for sequence variants. after filtering out common polymorphisms, the assessment and interpretation of detected personal variants in the clinical context is an often time-consuming effort. we have developed genetalk, a web-based platform that serves as an expert exchange network for the assessment of personal and potentially disease-relevant sequence variants. genetalk assists a clinical geneticist who is searching for information about specific sequence variants and connects this user to other users with expertise for the same sequence variant. availability: genetalk is available at www.gene-talk.de. users can login without registering in a demo account.exome sequencing has become an invaluably powerful tool in the identification of disease causing variants and the first patients are now already treated based on sequence variant information of their exomes . to date, the primary bottleneck in such clinical personal genome cases is not anymore data generation but data analysis. clinical geneticists therefore require efficient tools for filtering and interpreting the clinically meaningful sequence variants. currently, the most potent filters for reducing the set of novel and potentially causal mutations in rare diseases are based on variation data from population scale sequencing efforts such as the 1000 genomes project (www.1000genomes.org). only very few variants will be medically relevant, perhapsin case of a monogenic disorderjust one. bioinformatics tools such as annovar and mutationtaster may then be used for comprehensive annotations and predictions about the expected pathogenicity of a variant. however, such classifiers have high false-positive and-negative error rates. they may therefore serve only for prioritization but cannot replace the assessment of human experts.genetalk is an exchange platform that allows users to look for variant-specific information and makes human expertise searchable . any sequence variant with respect to the human reference genome, based on the grch37 assembly, is annotatable. the user decides to whom an annotation is visible. one user may link to scientific articles that are relevant in context with a certain variant or that even provide evidence that a mutation is disease causing. a second user might comment on this annotation to express her concern because she views the detected variant as an technical artefact. a third user might state that she has seen patients with this genotype and is not sure about the statistical significance of the association with the phenotype. all annotations and comments of genetalk users about a certain genomic position can be read like a locus-specific conversation thread. the trustworthiness of annotations can be rated by users as well as the likelihood of a mutation to be disease causing . if there is consensus in the genetalk community that to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2012. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license

pathogenic and its annotation is trustworthy, this mutation is added to the annotation track pathogenic. this annotation track is thus curated in a collaborative effort of all genetalk users. genetalk also assists users in filtering genetic variants from ngs projects. a user that has a patients informed consent to analyze the clinical data may upload sequence variants to genetalk in variant call format (vcf) , version 4.0 and above. in order to reduce the initial vcf to a set of potentially disease relevant mutations, the user can apply certain filter settings first: the list of variants could be restricted to, e.g. only nonsynonymous, homozygous variants with the functional and inheritance filter. common variants can be filtered out by a genotype frequency filter that is based on high-quality ngs data sets from hapmap, the 1000 genomes project and the 5000 exomes project. if a linkage analysis has been performed, a genomic interval may be set to limit the search space or gene panels may be applied as in silico filters to restrict the analysis to certain molecular pathways. in a rare recessive monogenic disease, the mode of inheritance and the genotype frequency filter that is set to 1/1000 usually reduce the number of candidate mutations down to a few hundreds in a patients exome. these variants may then be further analyzed for disease-causing annotations. if the pathogenic mutation of this case has not yet been described in the literature and no pathogenic annotation exists, the user can look for annotations that discuss patients with similar phenotypes or basic research scientists that talk about unpublished experimental data for this gene. such an annotation can serve as a conversation starter and the users can simply contact the author by clicking on the envelope symbol . currently, the annotation database contains over 32 000 clinically relevant entries from dbsnp. a video tutorial on www.genetalk.de illustrates how an exome dataset may be analyzed in genetalk: in a few easy steps, the variant data of a simulated patient with hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome are filtered down to the disease-causing mutation.
