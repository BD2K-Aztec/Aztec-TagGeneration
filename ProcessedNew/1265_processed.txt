gene expression data exploration, quality control and testing in single-cell qpcr-based gene expression experiments motivation: cell populations are never truly homogeneous; individual cells exist in biochemical states that define functional differences between them. new technology based on microfluidic arrays combined with multiplexed quantitative polymerase chain reactions now enables high-throughput single-cell gene expression measurement, allowing assessment of cellular heterogeneity. however, few analytic tools have been developed specifically for the statistical and analytical challenges of single-cell quantitative polymerase chain reactions data. results: we present a statistical framework for the exploration, quality control and analysis of single-cell gene expression data from micro-fluidic arrays. we assess accuracy and within-sample heterogeneity of single-cell expression and develop quality control criteria to filter unreliable cell measurements. we propose a statistical model accounting for the fact that genes at the single-cell level can be on (and a continuous expression measure is recorded) or dichotomously off (and the recorded expression is zero). based on this model, we derive a combined likelihood ratio test for differential expression that incorporates both the discrete and continuous components. using an experiment that examines treatment-specific changes in expression, we show that this combined test is more powerful than either the continuous or dichotomous component in isolation, or a t-test on the zero-inflated data. although developed for measurements from a specific platform (fluidigm), these tools are generalizable to other multi-parametric measures over large numbers of events. availability: all results presented here were obtained using the singlecellassay r package available on github (http://github.com/ rglab/singlecellassay).the development of fluorescence-based flow cytometry (fcm) revolutionized single-cell analysis. although populations of cells sorted by fcm using surface markers may appear monolithic, mrna expression of specific genes within these cells can be heterogeneous and could further discriminate cell subsets. on the other hand, classical gene expression experiments [microarrays, rna-seq, quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qpcr)] richly characterize a cellular population but at the cost of reporting a summation of expression from many individual cells. recent advances in microfluidic technology now permit performing thousands of pcrs in a single device, enabling gene expression measurements at the single-cell level across hundreds of cells and genes . this provides a technology that probes the stochastic nature of biochemical processes, resulting in relatively large cell-to-cell expression variability. this heterogeneity may carry important information; thus, single-cell expression data should not be analysed in the same fashion as population-level data. at the scale of a single cell, biological variability (the object of interest) and technical variability (a nuisance factor) are often of the same magnitude, making it difficult to distinguish between the two. no expression (i.e. the gene is off) may be detected in individual cells owing to real biological effects, resulting in zero-inflation of otherwise continuous measures. these features of single-cell data require special attention during analysis. here, we focus on the reverse-transcriptase qpcr (rt-qpcr)based fluidigm (san francisco, ca) single-cell gene expression assay, which provides simultaneous measurements of up to 96 genes on mrna sources as minute as a single cell. in traditional rt-qpcr, despite careful measurement of input cdna concentrations, differences in starting material below the limit of detection require correction for reliable results . subtraction of internal control genes, or averages thereof is typically used (e.g. the -ct method), and results are often reported in fold increase per cell . in array-based gene expression, differences in hybridization and washing of non-specific dna between chips require additional correction. such normalization schemes are not directly applicable in single-cell gene expression experiments, nor is it obvious that they are needed. for single cells, the individual cell is the atomic unit of normalization and the amount of starting material naturally measured in number of cells per reaction. even if one attempted direct application of traditional normalization to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2012. published by oxford university press. all rights reserved. for permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. approaches, the dichotomous nature of single-cell expression hinders their use. nonetheless, it is important to test for and address any technical biases. we present a filtering approach for removing outlying measurements at the single-cell level that accounts for the dichotomous nature of the data. using concordance measures derived from three datasets where gene expression was measured at the single-cell and 100-cell levels, we show that classical rt-qpcr type normalization is not necessary with single-cell multiplexed pcr data, and that our filtering step removes technical artifacts that most severely impact quantitation. a typical goal of gene expression experiments is to search for differential expression across groups. the zero-inflation of expression in fluidigm introduces problems for testing differential representation of cell subsets characterized by expression patterns, as well. traditional tests of differential expression such as the t-test or other approaches based on normality are likely inappropriate for zero-inflated data . approaches to this problem have varied.used a winsorized z-transformation of the expression values and then treated them as continuous.used the non-parametric, kolmorgovsmirnov test for differences in distribution to find differentially expressed genes after winsorizing.dichotomized the expression and worked with the binary trait. of these authors, onlymade use of formal tests of differential expression. however, as we will see later, both the continuous and discrete parts of the measurements are informative for differential expression and should be used. a parametric test allows directions of difference to be assessed. here, we propose a discrete/continuous model for single-cell expression data based on a mixture of a point mass at zero and a log-normal distribution. using this model, we derive a likelihood ratio test (lrt) that can simultaneously test for changes in mean expression (conditional on the gene being expressed) and in the percentage of expressed cells.
