sequence analysis janusâ€”a comprehensive tool investigating the two faces of transcription motivation: protocols to generate strand-specific transcriptomes with next-generation sequencing platforms have been used by the scientific community roughly since 2008. strand-specific reads allow for detection of antisense events and a higher resolution of expression profiles enabling extension of current transcript annotations. however, applications making use of this strandedness information are still scarce. results: here we present a tool (janus), which focuses on the identification of transcriptional active regions in antisense orientation to known and novel transcribed elements of the genome. janus can compare the antisense events of multiple samples and assigns scores to identify mutual expression of either transcript in a sense/ antisense pair, which could hint to regulatory mechanisms. janus is able to make use of single-nucleotide variant (snv) and methylation data, if available, and reports the sense to antisense ratio of regions in the vicinity of the identified genetic and epigenetic variation. janus interrogates positions of heterozygous snvs to identify strand-specific allelic imbalance. availability: janus is written in c/c and freely available at http:// www.ikmb.uni-kiel.de/janus/janus.html under terms of gnu general public license, for both, linux and windows 64. although the bin-aries will work without additional downloads, the software depends on bamtools (https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools) for compilation. a detailed tutorial section is included in the first section of the supplemental material and included as brief readme.txt in the tutorial archive. contactthe ancient greek historian plutarch writes about janus: for this janus, whether in remote antiquity he were a demigod or a king, was certainly a great lover of civil and social unity, and one who reclaimed men from brutal and savage living; for which reason they figure him with two faces, to represent the two states and conditions out of the one of which he brought mankind, to lead them into the other. (plutarchus, 75 a.c.e.). we decided to call our tool janus, as it observes transcription of the double-stranded dna, which often happens in opposite directions at a given locus. we term the transcription occurring on the strand opposite to the template strand antisense transcription. antisense transcripts may have a regulatory effect on the expression of the sense transcript, which has been reported for several sense/antisense (s/as) pairs before, for example, in the x-chromosomal inactivation involving xist and tsix . another example is given by morris et al., who reported that expression of the p21 antisense transcript mediates methylation of the p21 sense promoter by recruitment of epigenetic regulatory complexes and showed that this effect was reversible by small interfering rna (sirna)-induced knockdown of the antisense transcript . published data about antisense transcription are sometimes contradictory, underlining the high complexity of the matter.published an article in which they investigated s/as patterns in different human cell lines using the illumina ga, detecting a high abundance of antisense tags within exons . in contrast, in an article published byused the solid system, only few antisense tags were detected in the coding regions of genes . however, both articles agree on an abundance of antisense transcription occurring in promoter and terminator regions. to the best of our knowledge, no publicly available tool has been released to the scientific community to easily identify s/as pairs using next-generation sequencing data. to address this, we developed janus. it allows identification of s/as pairs on the genome-wide level, using common input formats of sequencing data from strand-specific experiments, and detects differences between multiple samples. it is capable of including methylation data in the results and investigates s/as ratios at single-nucleotide variant (snv) positions. janus was developed to work under linux and windows, but is restricted to 64-bit environments owing to the memory requirements. to whom correspondence should be addressed.simulated data have been used to assess the performance of janus (see supplementary material for generation of simulated data). using a coverage threshold of 3 per base for the detection of antisense events, $84.59 of simulated as events were detected with exact start and end position (supplementary). an additional 3.26 of simulated as events were detected with exact start or end position and 12.15 did not match any of the simulated ends exactly. however, these 12.15 include as events that are within simulated as events but do not fit the simulated start and end exactly. also, some as events were generated with less than three coverage per base, and thus will not bedetected. therefore, the 85 given above is a conservative estimation. additionally, we estimated the effect of different parameters on the detection of as events by janus (supplementary). the most important filter in the simulated dataset is the coverage per base threshold. using a higher coverage threshold effectively reduces the number of false-positive antisense events. however, it also removes lowly covered true-positive events. using a length cutoff and using the noise filter had only limited consequences on the detection of simulated antisense events. this is partially due to the minimum length requirement during simulation that is at least two times the read length for sense transcripts and 300 bp for the antisense transcripts. also, besides mismapped reads, no additional noise was added by the simulation. therefore, the effect of these parameters will be bigger in real datasets. janus performance to identify s/as transcript pairs with allelic imbalance was also assessed using simulated data (see supplementary material for data generation). data were only simulated for chromosome 1, which resulted in 59 transcript pairs that shared overlapping regions (supplementary). in these regions, snvs were introduced with varying numbers of alternative allele reads, resulting in 11 transcript pairs that showed a different major allele [valid allelic imbalance events (aie)]. janus identified a total of 46 aie including 8 valid simulated aie. the remaining 3 valid aie were generated with low numbers of alternative alleles (2, 1 and 1 for the as transcript, respectively), which were not detected owing to mapping problems. twenty-two of the aie detected by janus showed a p-value below 0.05, including six of the valid aie. of the remaining 16 aie, 15 can be traced back to mapping problems close to splice junctions (supplementary), where reads containing only one to five bases of the neighboring exons are mapped partially into the intron. the remaining false-positive aie with p-value below 0.05 is caused by other types of mismapping. although janus identifies most of the simulated aie, it is important to consider the results with care, as mismapping (especially close to splice-junctions) can easily lead to a falsepositive aie detection. solid rnaseq data from real experiments (see next section for more details about this data) was mapped using different tools to assess the effect of different mappers on the analysis of janus. the bioscope software of applied biosystems performed best when comparing the number of mapped reads of all mappers used (bioscope, bwa, bowtie/tophat) (supplementary). the number of identified antisense events is highly dependent on the number of mapped sequences, and thus the data mapped with bioscope yields more antisense events (supplementary). the run time of janus shows an almost linear increase with higher read numbers (supplementary), and the overlap of detected antisense events from the different mappings shows that there is almost complete overlap between different bioscope mappings, but far less overlap with the other two mappers (supplementary). therefore, the bioscope software seems to work best for the investigated color-space libraries., for which also methylation data based on infinium humanmethylation27 beadchips (illumina, san diego, usa) was available . these data were mapped against the human hg18 reference, and the corresponding gene annotation (knowngenes) from the ucsc was used (see supplementary material for mapping parameters). also stranded data for two different mouse cell types (small intestine, colon) was investigated (geo accession number gse21746) that has been mapped against the mm9 reference. duplicates in bam files were marked using picard tools. the two technologies [solid wtak and illumina ga iix (displayed different patterns. the illumina data show a high abundance of antisense tags in exonic regions that follow the intron exon structure of the sense transcript. we estimated a failure rate of $56 for illumina ga iix strand-specific data and 51 failure rate for solid wtak (whole transcriptome analysis kit) strand-specific data . to demonstrate the biological impact of janus, we focused the following analysis on the solid data, as it exhibits less background noise. for each sample, a large amount of antisense events was detected, one example for each s/as class is presented in supplementary. many unannotated transcripts were detected by janus, one such example is given in supplementary. antisense transcription occurring in promoter and terminator regions, here defined as 1 kb before and after the transcript start and end site, was investigated. of 32 110 (hg18, chl data) and 66 065 (hg19, lcl data) annotated transcripts, an average of 760 promoter and 980 terminator regions (hg18) and 2100 promoter and 2400 terminator regions (hg19) showed antisense transcription with a minimum length of 150 bp and a mean coverage per base of at least five (supplementary). a comparison of identified antisense events in promoter and terminator regions for different coverage limits is shown in supplementary. considering all occurring transcription, terminator and promoter regions show a high abundance of sense tags. by filtering for promoter and terminator regions, which show an antisense event of a certain size (here 150 bp), the amount of sense tags is dramatically reduced and the amount of antisense tags increases, which is not surprising. however, by further filtering for minimum antisense coverage, the amount of antisense tags increases stronger in the terminator regions relative to the promoter region. for both sets of human samples (1000 genomes individuals, chl cell lines), we were able to identify s/as pairs that show mutually exclusive expression of either transcript. in the lcl, only one lucid pair (sepp1/ccdc152, supplementaryand supplementary) could be identified. in contrast, despite being also derived from b-cells, the chl cell lines showed multiple such events that could indicate that asmediated gene silencing plays a role in the pathogenesis of these tumors (supplementaryand supplementary figs s14s16). supplementaryshows tissue-specific examples of differentially expressed antisense transcripts in the investigated mouse libraries. in the 1000 genomes samples, several s/as pairs that show a positively correlated expression pattern could be detected by the default parameters of the program (supplementaryand supplementary figs s18s24). three examples for s/as pairs that correlate in expression in the chl dataset are shown in supplementary figures s25s27. supplementaryillustrates an example of a tissue-specific co-expressed s/as pair in the investigated mouse libraries. one probably falsepositive example of a positive correlated s/as pair is shown in supplementary, the pair is occurring in a repeat region and has roughly the same size and shape on both strands, and thus it is unlikely to be real expression on both strands. the repeat region shows strong expression in the l-1236 dataset but not in the other samples. interestingly, it has been shown that derepression of a terminal repeat can lead to the activation of a proto-oncogene in human lymphoma . one case with a slight correlation of cpg methylation degree and differential expression of s/as pairs was detected in the chl data (supplementary). the mean methylation beta values at two distinct locations near the zscan16 promoter range from 0.02 to 0.15 for l-1236 and u-ho1 and 0.45 to 0.54 in km-h2 (supplementary). expression of a short antisense transcript occurs only in km-h2, while the sense transcript is only expressed in the other two cell lines. allele-specific expression data of known snvs did not show any s/as pairs with both transcripts expressed from different homologs exclusively. however, we identified some cases of allelic imbalance between the transcripts on the first and second strand (supplementary figs s30 and s31). the first example shows expression of ncaph2 and sco2. while most reads corresponding to ncaph2 expression show the g allele and only few show the t allele, the opposite was found for reads corresponding to sco2 expression. the second example shows expression of fan1 and mtmr10. reads corresponding to fan1 expression show both snv alleles (t/c), while the reads corresponding to mtmr10 expression show the c allele only. janus also identified several snvs (in the approach without a priori knowledge of snv positions) where both alleles are exclusively expressed on either strand. supplementaryshows one such example. the region transcribed in antisense direction is overlapping a vega annotated pseudogene, overlaps partially a non-repeat masked duplication and the identified snvs are not included in the well characterized snv list of the 1000 genomes project, and thus this example represents likely a false positive. considering antisense events with low coverage in the promoter and terminator regions, the amount of antisense tags in promoter regions is higher than in terminator regions, while this shifts toward more antisense tags in terminator regions when considering only higher covered antisense events. this could be caused by a higher mismapping in promoter regions, maybe due to conserved motifs of transcription factor binding sites and tata-like sequences, which generates a higher noise level. another explanation is that there is more low-level antisense transcription occurring in promoter regions and stronger antisense transcription in terminator regions. also, it is possible that s/as pairs in head-tohead conformation show lower expression than s/as pairs in tail-to-tail conformation. among the huge amount of detected s/as pairs, there are some pairs that show mutually exclusive expression of one strand in some samples, and expression of the other strand in others. the low number of these s/as pairs suggests that they are rare events in the population and/or affect only a small proportion of transcripts. it remains unclear if there is an inhibitory effect of one transcript on its counterpart or if other mechanisms such as epigenetic modifications are involved, as has been shown for the highly imprinted gnas locus in mice . we could identify several s/as pairs that are co-expressed and show an equal expression rate of both transcripts, but differ in expression between samples. it could be argued this is caused by different library performance (i.e. this region was just unlucky in some samples) or a coverage bias might persist despite normalizing for the total coverage per sample. however, as shown in supplementaryshows a similar expression rate in all samples, while trim71 and the unknown antisense event show a positively correlated expression, which differs between samples. it is unlikely that the observed co-expression is due to coverage effects.suggested that long non-coding rnas might be involved in s/as pairs, reasoned by a higher number of s/as pairs detected by random primed cap-analysis-gene-expression (cage) compared with oligo-dt primed cage. it could be speculated that the identified as event upstream of trim71 might present such a non-coding rna, as no exonintron structure is visible. interestingly, in the same article, katayama et al. reported a frequent concordant regulation of s/as pairs. another study byprovides further evidence of a high occurrence of positively correlated s/as pairs. the reason for this remains unclear, but it could be due to the fact that transcription of one strand makes the other strand more accessible as well. linked to this, palindromic sequences in regulatory regions, such as promoter regions, might be used by both strands. in this case, the observed transcript could be nonsense transcription, which ends by the first possible encountered transcription end signal. this might explain why antisense transcripts in promoter regions are often described as short and long non-coding rnas. however, it is not unlikely that these antisense transcripts have some function, as they do not occur in all promoter or terminator regions of every expressed gene. multiple studies showed that non-coding rnas might alter chromatin conformation or lead to a local change of methylation if they are located within promoter regions . using the data available to us, we could not link sense and antisense transcription to methylation of cpg islands, except weakly for one case, which might be coincidental. it is possible that the limited number of cpg islands interrogated by the chip
