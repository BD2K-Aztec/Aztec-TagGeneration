shifted hamming distance: a fast and accurate simd-friendly filter to accelerate alignment verification in read mapping motivation: calculating the edit-distance (i.e. minimum number of insertions, deletions and substitutions) between short dna sequences is the primary task performed by seed-and-extend based mappers, which compare billions of sequences. in practice, only sequence pairs with a small edit-distance provide useful scientific data. however, the majority of sequence pairs analyzed by seed-and-extend based mappers differ by significantly more errors than what is typically allowed. such error-abundant sequence pairs needlessly waste resources and severely hinder the performance of read mappers. therefore, it is crucial to develop a fast and accurate filter that can rapidly and efficiently detect error-abundant string pairs and remove them from consideration before more computationally expensive methods are used. results: we present a simple and efficient algorithm, shifted hamming distance (shd), which accelerates the alignment verification procedure in read mapping, by quickly filtering out error-abundant sequence pairs using bit-parallel and simd-parallel operations. shd only filters string pairs that contain more errors than a user-defined threshold, making it fully comprehensive. it also maintains high accuracy with moderate error threshold (up to 5 of the string length) while achieving a 3-fold speedup over the best previous algorithm (gene myerss bit-vector algorithm). shd is compatible with all mappers that perform sequence alignment for verification. availability and implementation: we provide an implementation of shd in c with intel sse instructions at: https://github.com/cmu-safari/shd.the emergence of massively parallel sequencing technologies, commonly called high-throughput sequencing platforms, during the past decade triggered a revolution in the field of genomics. these platforms enable scientists to sequence mammalian-sized genomes in a matter of days, which has created new opportunities for biological research. for example, it is now possible to investigate human genome diversity between populations 1000 genomes project), find genomic variants likely to cause disease and ancient hominids to better understand human evolution. however, these new sequencing platforms drastically increase the computational burden of genome data analysis. in the first step of data analysis, billions of short dna segments (called reads) are aligned to a long reference genome. each read is mapped to one or more sites in the reference based on similarity with a process called read mapping. read mappers typically fall into one of two main categories: suffix-array and backtracking-based (; langmead and salzberg 2012; li and durbin 2010) or seed-and-extend-based . suffix-array-based mappers use the burrows-wheeler transformation and are efficient at finding the best mappings of a read. mappers in this category use aggressive algorithms to build their candidate pools, which may miss potentially correct mappings. although mappers in this category can also be configured to achieve higher sensitivity by systematically inspecting all possible error scenarios of a read, such configuration increases their execution times superlinearly (; langmead and salzberg 2012; li and durbin 2010). alternatively, seed-and-extend-based mappers build comprehensive but overly large candidate pools and rely on filters and local alignment techniques to remove incorrect mappings (i.e. potential mappings with more errors than allowed) from consideration in the verification step. mappers in this category are comprehensive (find all correct mappings of a read) and accurate (do not provide incorrect mappings), but waste computational resources identifying and rejecting incorrect mappings. as a result, they are slower than suffix-array-based mappers. fast and accurate filters, which detect and reject incorrect mappings using cheap heuristics can increase the speed of seedand-extend mappers (by speeding up the verification procedure,) while maintaining their high accuracy and comprehensiveness. an ideal filter should be able to quickly verify the correctness of a mapping, yet require much less computation than rigorous local alignment, which precisely calculates the number of errors between the read and reference using dynamic programming methods. more importantly, a filter should never falsely remove a correct mapping from consideration, as this would reduce the comprehensiveness of the mapper. recent work has shown the potential of using single instruction multiple data (simd) vector execution units including general-purpose gpus and intel sse intel (2012) to accelerate local alignment techniques . however, these publications only apply simd units to existing scalar algorithms, which do not exploit the massive bitparallelism provided by simd platforms. in this article, we present shifted hamming distance (shd), a fast and accurate simd-friendly bit-vector filter to accelerate the local alignment (verification) procedure in read mapping. the key idea of shd is to avoid wasting computational resources on incorrect mappings by verifying them with a cheap, simd-friendly filter before invoking canonical complex local alignment methods. our studies show that shd quickly identifies the majority of the incorrect mappings, especially ones that contain far more errors than allowed, while permitting only a small fraction of incorrect mappings to pass shd which are later filtered out by more sophisticated and accurate filters or by local alignment techniques. this article makes the following contributions: @bullet we show that for seed-and-extend-based mappers, most potential mappings contain far more errors than what is typically allowed (section 2). @bullet we introduce a fast and accurate simd-friendly bit-vector filter, shd, which approximately verifies a potential mapping with a small set of simd-friendly operations (section 3). @bullet we prove that shd never removes correct mappings from consideration; hence, shd never reduces the accuracy or the comprehensiveness of a mapper (section 3). @bullet we provide an implementation of shd with intel sse (section 3) and compare it against three previously proposed filtering and local alignment implementations (section 4), including an sse implementation of the smithwaterman algorithm, swps3 ; an implementation of gene myerss bit-vector algorithm, seqan (d ring et al., 2008) and an implementation of our adjacency filtering algorithm, fasthash . our results on a wide variety of real read sets show that shd sse is both fast and accurate. shd sse provides up to 3 speedup against the best previous state-of-the-art edit-distance implementation (d ring et al., 2008) with a maximum false-positive rate of 7 (the rate of incorrect mappings passing shd).read mappers identify locations within a reference genome where the read and the reference match within a user-defined error (i.e. insertions, deletions or substitutions) threshold, e. in practice, e is usually 5 of the read length, but most aligners can be configured to return only the best mapping (the mapping with the fewest errors). as seen in(in supplementary materials), most potential location mappings tested by seed-and-extend based mappers are incorrect (having more errors than allowed); in fact, when e 5 of the read length, more than 98 of mappings are incorrect. since alignment is the primary computationally intensive task performed by seed-and-extend-based read mappers , it is crucial that incorrect mappings be rejected efficiently. many mechanisms have been proposed to efficiently calculate the edit-distance of strings and filter out incorrect mappings. these mechanisms can be divided into five main classes: (i) dynamic programming (dp) algorithms, (ii) simd implementations of dp algorithms, (iii) bit-vector implementations of dp algorithms, (iv) hamming distance calculation and (v) locality-based filtering mechanisms. notice that although mechanisms in both (ii) and (iii) are different implementations of (i), we separate them into two categories because they use different optimization strategies: while mechanisms in (ii) faithfully implement the dp algorithm in a simd fashion, mechanisms in (iii) use a modified bit-parallel algorithm to calculate a bit representation of the dp matrix . full descriptions of each strategy are provided in supplementary materials, section s1.3. in this article, we choose three representative implementations from (ii), (iii) and (v): swps3 , seqan and fasthash (for detailed analysis, see supplementary materials s1.3). these mechanisms were not designed as simd bit-parallel filters and are either fast or accurate (can filter out most incorrect mappings) but not both. conversely, we designed shd to leverage bit-parallelism and simd instructions to achieve high performance while preserving high accuracy.we implemented shd in c, using intel sse. we compared shd against three edit-distance calculation/filtering implementations, they are: seqan , an implementation of gene myerss bit-vector algorithm ; swps3 , a smith-waterman algorithm (smith and) implementation; and fasthash , an adjacency filtering (af) implementation. both seqan and swps3 are also implemented with sse and all implementations were configured to be single threaded. we used a popular seed-and-extend mapper, mrfast , to retrieve all potential mappings (read-reference pairs) from 10 real datasets from the 1000 genome project phase i (1000 genomes project consortium 2012).lists the read length and read size of each set. each read set is processed using multiple error thresholds (i.e. e from 0 to 5 errors). we benchmarked all four implementations using the same potential mappings (i.e. seed hits) produced by mrfast for a fair comparison of the four techniques.shows the execution time of the four techniques with different error thresholds across multiple read sets. notice that when the indel threshold is zero, shd reduces to bit-parallel hamming distance. a detailed comparison against bit-parallel hamming distance implementation is provided in supplementary materials, section s1.3. among the four implementations, shd is on average 3 faster than seqan and 24 faster than swps3. although shd is slightly slower than fasthash (af) when e is greater than two (e.g. 2:5 slower when e 5), shd produces far fewer (on average, 0:25) false positives than fasthash (seen in). note, the speedup gained by shd diminishes with greater e. this is expected since the number of bit-parallel/simd operations of shd increases for larger e.illustrates the false-positive rates of shd and fasthash (af). seqan and swps3 both have a 0 false-positive rate, compared with shd which has a 3 false-positive rate on average. that being the case, shd is only a heuristic to filter potential mappings while both seqan and swps3 must compute the exact edit distances of the potential mappings. as we discussed in section 3.3, the false-positive rate of shd increases with larger e. nonetheless, the false-positive rate of shd at e 5 is only 7, much smaller than the false-positive rate (50) of fasthash (af) asshows. with these results, a mapper can selectively combine multiple implementations together to construct an efficient multi-layer filter/ edit-distance calculator. for instance, a mapper can attach shd with fasthash, to obtain both the fast-speed of fasthash and the high accuracy of shd. a mapper can also combine shd with seqan to obtain 100 accuracy without significantly sacrificing the speed of shd. of course, there are many possibilities to integrate shd into a other mappers, but a comprehensive study of this topic is beyond the scope of this article and is part of our future work.most potential mappings that must be verified by seed-and-extendbased mappers are incorrect, containing far more errors than what is typically allowed. our proposed filtering algorithm, shd, can quickly identify most incorrect mappings (through our experiment, shd can filter 86 billion potential mappings within 40 min on a single thread while obtaining a false-positive rate of 7 at maximum), while preserving all correct ones. comparison against three other state-of-the-art edit-distance calculation/filtering implementations revealed that our intel sse implementation of shd is 3 faster than seqan , the previous best edit-distance calculation technique.
