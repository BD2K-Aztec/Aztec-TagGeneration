cas-analyzer: an online tool for assessing ge-nome editing results using ngs data genome editing with programmable nucleases has been widely adopted in research and medicine. next generation sequencing (ngs) platforms are now widely used for measuring the frequencies of mutations induced by crispr-cas9 and other programmable nucleases. here, we present an online tool, cas-analyzer, a javascript-based implementation for ngs data analysis. because cas-analyzer is completely used at a client-side web browser on-the-fly, there is no need to upload very large ngs datasets to a server, a time-consuming step in genome editing analysis. currently , cas-analyzer supports various programmable nucleases, including single nucleases and paired nucleases. availability: free access at http://www.rgenome.net/cas-analyzer/. contactprogrammable nucleases such as zinc finger nucleases (zfns), transcription-activator-like effector nucleases (talens), and rna-guided endonucleases (rgens) derived from crispr-cas9/cpf1 systems, which are adaptive immune responses in bacteria and archaea, are widely used for genome editing in many research fields including biology, biotechnology, agriculture, and medical science . the type ii cas9 nuclease from streptococcus pyogenes (spcas9) was the first crispr nuclease used for genome editing ; since that time, various orthogonal cas9 nucleases such as stcas9 , nmcas9 , and sacas9 have been developed. recently, putative type v cpf1 nucleases from acidominococcus and lachnospiraceae were reported to mediate efficient genome editing in human cells and mice . moreover, dimeric crispr nucleases such as rna-guided nickases and rna-guided foki nucleases , or biochemical improvement of wild-type spcas9 have been developed for genome editing to reduce off-target effects. programmable nucleases introduce dna double-strand breaks (dsbs) at user-defined target sites in the genome, ultimately inducing targeted gene knockout or knock-in via the cells own repair systems [error-prone non-homologous end joining (nhej) or homology-directed repair (hdr) in the presence of a dna template, respectively]. the induced mutation rates in cells can be estimated in a straightforward manner by using surveyor nuclease , the t7 endonuclease i (t7e1) assay , polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page) , or droplet digital pcr . however, these methods do not allow analysis of mutant sequences and are limited by relatively poor sensitivity. recently we and other groups have used targeted deep sequencing to detect programmable nucleaseinduced mutations with high sensitivity and precision and to analyze mutation patterns . however, analysis of next generation sequencing (ngs) data is difficult for many researchers. although a few web-based tools such as crispr-ga , ageseq , and crispresso are available, they are inconvenient to use because their web interfaces require a very long time to upload large associate editor: prof. alfonso valencia the author(s) 2016. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution non-commercial license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), which permits non-commercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. for commercial re-use, please contact journals.permissions@oup.com data files (supplementary note 1). ageseq and crispresso also support a command-line interface, but they are not accessible to researchers who are not familiar with bioinformatics. to address this issue, we present a web-based tool, cas-analyzer, that is constructed with a javascript-based algorithm; thus, it wholly runs on the client-side so that large amounts of sequencing data do not need to be uploaded to the server. thanks to the improvements in the newest javascript engines in the most recent web browsers (supplementary), this tool works in a reasonable time. currently, cas-analyzer supports a variety of nucleases, including single nucleases (spcas9, stcas9, nmcas9, sacas9, cjcas9, and ascpf1/lbcpf1) and paired nucleases (zfns, talens, cas9 nickases, and dcas9-foki nucleases).
