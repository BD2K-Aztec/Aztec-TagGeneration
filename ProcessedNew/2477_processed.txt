informed kmer selection for de novo transcriptome assembly motivation: de novo transcriptome assembly is an integral part for many rna-seq workflows. common applications include sequencing of non-model organisms, cancer or meta transcrip-tomes. most de novo transcriptome assemblers use the de bruijn graph (dbg) as the underlying data structure. the quality of the assemblies produced by such assemblers is highly influenced by the exact word length k. as such no single kmer value leads to optimal results. instead, dbgs over different kmer values are built and the assemblies are merged to improve sensitivity. however, no studies have investigated thoroughly the problem of automatically learning at which kmer value to stop the assembly. instead a suboptimal selection of kmer values is often used in practice. results: here we investigate the contribution of a single kmer value in a multi-kmer based assembly approach. we find that a comparative clustering of related assemblies can be used to estimate the importance of an additional kmer assembly. using a model fit based algorithm we predict the kmer value at which no further assemblies are necessary. our approach is tested with different de novo assemblers for datasets with different coverage values and read lengths. further, we suggest a simple post processing step that significantly improves the quality of multi-kmer assemblies. conclusion: we provide an automatic method for limiting the number of kmer values without a significant loss in assembly quality but with savings in assembly time. this is a step forward to making multi-kmer methods more reliable and easier to use. availability and implementation:a general implementation of our approach can be found under: https://github.com/schulzlab/kreation.with the massive amounts of rna-seq data produced for many non-model organisms, the interest for de novo analyses of rna-seq data has increased over the last few years. these analyses include the de novo assembly of full length transcripts, expression level computation of novel transcripts, detecting differentially expressed transcripts and detection of related genes in close species or polymorphism detection . due to the large number of applications, several methods have been proposed for the de novo transcriptome assembly. most of these methods are based on building a de bruijn graph (dbg) from the rna-seq reads. the nodes of the dbg are substring of length k (also know as kmers) obtained from the reads and two nodes are connected if they have k-1 overlap. after obtaining the dbg, various heuristic algorithms are used to predict alternative transcripts from each dbg component. these algorithms either use a single kmer value or merge transcripts generated from multiple kmer values to obtain a final non-redundant assembly . a multi-kmer based approach outperforms a single-kmer based approach as one kmer size rarely fits all genes . large kmer values resolve repeats and regions with many errors, whereas small kmer values are necessary to connect lowly expressed transcripts that have low-coverage regions. hence even for most single kmer methods it is beneficial to run the assembler for different kmer values and merge the final results. but the question about the core set of kmer sizes that are needed to achieve a good quality assembly has received little attention for multi-kmer methods. currently, approaches (i) use the default kmer series of the assembler which is tuned on a limited number of datasets, (ii) select an arbitrary subset of kmer sizes or (iii) use all possible kmer sizes for the assembly. in practice that means that most often the resulting assembly is suboptimal. either important kmer sizes are missed (cases 12) and therefore the sensitivity is reduced or the complete assembly contains more misassemblies than necessary and has wasted computational resources (case 3). selecting a suitable kmer size for de novo assembly has been previously explored in the context of genomic sequencing. for example devised a method to select the best kmer size for de novo genome assembly. simpson devised a method to estimate a number of interesting characteristics like paths with variations or repeats in the dbg for different kmer sizes from a fmindex over the reads . further, computing an optimal kmer range for de novo read error correction was also proposed . however, all these methods assume a uniform coverage distribution and are not applicable to nonuniform rna-seq data. here we investigate in detail how the number of kmer assemblies can be minimized to save computational resources, without a large loss in sensitivity and without using a reference annotation for assembly quality assessment. we introduce the kreation (kmer range estimation) algorithm that is based on two novel contributions: (i) a comparative clustering of single kmer assemblies to define extended clusters which gives a notion of the assembly quality and (ii) a heuristic model assessment that allows to predict the optimal stopping point for a multi-kmer assembly method. we show that our new de novo strategy automates the choice of kmer sizes to explore, while achieving close to optimal performance.
