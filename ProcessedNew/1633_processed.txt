estimating the activity of transcription factors by the effect on their target genes motivation: understanding regulation of transcription is central for elucidating cellular regulation. several statistical and mechanistic models have come up the last couple of years explaining gene transcription levels using information of potential transcriptional regulators as transcription factors (tfs) and information from epigenetic modifications. the activity of tfs is often inferred by their transcription levels, promoter binding and epigenetic effects. however, in principle, these methods do not take hard-to-measure influences such as post-tran-scriptional modifications into account. results: for tfs, we present a novel concept circumventing this problem. we estimate the regulatory activity of tfs using their cumulative effects on their target genes. we established our model using expression data of 59 cell lines from the national cancer institute. the trained model was applied to an independent expression dataset of melanoma cells yielding excellent expression predictions and elucidated regulation of melanogenesis. availability and implementation: using mixed-integer linear programming , we implemented a switch-like optimization enabling a constrained but optimal selection of tfs and optimal model selection estimating their effects. the method is generic and can also be applied to further regulators of transcription.understanding regulation mechanisms of a cell is fundamental for biomedical research, and transcription factors (tfs) are the central regulators of gene expression. through identification of tf binding, the regulatory role of tfs can be inferred. hence, chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) techniques pulling down dna fragments binding to the tf were developed and scaled up using microarrays (chip-chip) and sequencing techniques (chipseq). genome-wide data have been produced from this for a large set of tfs and several cell systems stored in larger data repositories [e.g. (. however the specific cellular context under study usually does not match the experimental background of the deposited data. in addition, tf binding need not necessarily lead to a regulatory impact of the tf, in particular if the target gene is not expressed at all. hence, computational approaches have been developed using these data to apply it to gene expression data of the studied cells. for instance, cheng and co-workers used machine learning methods and a linear model to predict regulators explaining gene expression. they used chip-seq/chip-chip data from the encode project and identified distinctive regulation principles of generic and specific tfs, tfs binding preferentially to cpgs and cell type specificity. interestingly, their method was challenged when predicting transcription levels of genes under complex cellular control, such as cell cycle genes. chip data have been used to compile position-weight matrices, which were used to scan the genome for tf-specific binding motifs independent of the cellular context. however, this method comes along with high false-positive rates. modelling techniques were applied to filter out such non-functional predictions.used a sparse linear model explaining gene expression. their model was based on tf binding site predictions in promoters and mirnas in the 3 0 utr (utr, untranslated region) aiming to predict regulators leading to glioblastoma tumour formation. techniques were designed to elucidate regulation principles between tfs and their putative target genes. the algorithm for the reconstruction of accurate cellular networks [aracne (and the context likelihood of relatedness [clr (both use the transcription level of a tf to estimate its activity by calculating pearsons correlation or mutual information to its target genes. aracne and clr were combined and successfully applied to identify target genes for nrf2 in murine lungs in response to oxidative stress . however, there are many steps between mrna translation of a tf and the actual transcriptional regulation of target genes. the tf can be post-translationally modified, i.e. it can be methylated, ubiquinated or phosphorylated. phosphorylations are often necessary for dimerization and binding to the target genes promoter. it was shown that such modifications can have a substantial impact on tfs regulating their target genes . the underlying concept that expression of the target genes depends mainly on the mrna gradients of their regulating tfs is often violated, in particular in higher eukaryotes. it was shown to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative

furthermore, tfs can interact, they can regulate other tfs directly, if a tf binds to a promoter of another regulator, or indirectly, if the expression of modifying enzymes such as kinases is altered. hence, the expression level of a tf is often not suitable to describe its activity. more suitable readouts are the expression levels of the tfs targets because all these effects are integrated. in contrast to previous attempts, we based our predictions on the effects to the direct target genes of the tfs. we estimated the activity of a tf using a global approach, i.e. regarding the regulation of all its target genes. it is to note that this also accounts for the fact that in different cells a tf can have a different impact on its targets . typically, several tfs can bind to a genes promoter and different tfs may compete for binding sites. to model this, we used a linear approach. similarly to previous studies , the models were optimized by predicting gene expression based on putative regulators (tfs) and their predicted impact. more than a decade ago, one of the first systems biology approaches was established using constraintbased modelling to integrate stoichiometric equations under equilibrium conditions . for this, the mathematical concept of mixed-integer linear programming (milp) was used. shachar and co-workers used milp for calculating steiner trees combining shortest paths in signalling networks of yeast . we used the same mathematical concept to assemble signalling and biochemical pathways for recognition of transcriptional patterns . now, we used this technique for elaborated regulation models to elucidate regulation mechanisms. in contrast to a sparse lasso approach, milp allowed us to (i) get an optimized selection of tfs for a predefined number of parameters and to (ii) use a switching concept, which enabled the optimization algorithm to decide for each tf to be modelled by its cumulative effect on the target genes (activity) or its gene expression level (tf-gene expression). this concept allowed an unbiased and tf-specific comparison of the two approaches.several elaborated methods have been developed and established the past couple of years to elucidate cellular regulation of transcription. the models range from highly non-linear approaches using e.g. support vector machines and random forests to mathematically rather simple linear models . common to these approaches is the straightforward concept to gain a better mechanistic understanding if the models can well predict known transcript levels after concise selection of putative regulatory information. this information ranges from tfs binding at promoters and enhancers, mirna seeds and, now highly investigated, a large variety of epigenetic modifications of histones and dna. the task is challenging, as transcriptional regulation is highly complex, and all these approaches cover only the tip of the iceberg. assuming that regulation principles are redundant, they may well be modelled even if basing on data that gives insight to only parts of this machinery. however, these investigations often do not cover post-transcriptional control as this comes along with more demanding experimental efforts, and such control is intrinsically distinct from functional genomics regulation. our activity concept is one approach to circumvent this. it integrates the underlying general influence of a single regulator by using the information of differential expression of all its putative targets, assuming to be e.g. highly active when strong effects at the targets are observed. of course, this approach is only a starting point for more elaborate models as this, again, is based on putative regulatory interactions inferred from other cellular contexts. a future aspect is to iteratively improve the initial regulation assumptions by e.g. using bayesian statistics, coupled with an expectation-maximization algorithm. nevertheless, we obtained excellent performance results when validating our predictions by cross validation, and even when applying our trained machines to a completely unseen dataset (e.g. for dct gene: pcc r = 0.8 when comparing the model predictions to the measured gene expression). astonishingly, our approach was the method of choice to predict regulation of cell cycle genes. it was mentioned previously that regulation of cell cycle genes is difficult to model, as these genes are involved in a complex, post-transcriptional machinery . at least to some extent, our method may approach this challenge. to keep the model simple, it was restricted to regions proximal to the transcription start site (tss). however, distal binding at enhancers support transcriptional regulation. a future task can be the inclusion of distal binding information provided by the encode project in addition to the encode data we used for proximal binding to the tss. new coefficients could be added for enhancers with a positively restricted-value, due to the activating effect of enhancers, and negative-values for silencers. phenotypic traits can be inferred by transcriptional gene signatures. for example, kerwin et al. used gene signatures known to associate with defined circadian time phases to examine natural variation of the circadian clock . in contrast to these approaches, we rather constructed a mechanistic model of cellular regulation. we used signatures of gene groups (target genes of a tf) mostly basing on experimental evidence of a direct physical interaction (chip) with the mediator (tf), which itself interacts directly with the gene causing the investigated trait (its gene expression). we used a linear approach to infer regulation principles. linear models are commonly applied for this [e.g. (. dong et al. (2012) compared linear with non-linear models (random forests, multivariate adaptive regression splines) and got similar prediction accuracies. in contrast, cheng and co-workers compared four different approaches and got better results using the non-linear methods. as an outlook, we plan to investigate the activity approach within linear and non-linear models.followed a similar modelling concept, i.e. estimating the effect of a tf by minimizing the error term of prediction and measured gene expression. as experimental data, they used binding site information, concentration data of the tfs and the promotersequence for the investigated target genes. interestingly, they also modelled co-operativity of tfs assuming that the strength of such interactions depends on the distance between the bound tfs. we plan to integrate such an approach in future studies. we used the established framework of milp. milp facilitated (i) the selection of tfs and (ii) the individual selection how to optimally model them (by their cumulative effects we termed activity or by their transcript levels). with this, the biological diversity of gene expressions regulation could be modulated more precisely. but still, several assumptions were made to keep the model simple, neglecting e.g. epigenetic modifications. new coefficients and parameters can be added to include those factors. but this may come along with increased complexity of the model and may lead to wrong conclusions due to misleading arrangements of redundant information. if the final aim was only to predict gene expression, such an extension is straightforward. but the task of this regulation model was mainly to reveal regulators with high impact on the regulation of the gene under study. for example, for the genes tyr and dct, which are the pacemaker enzymes of melanin biosynthesis in melanocytes, a regulation model based on a tf network was successfully generated. using this regulation model, already well known tfs were identified as substantial regulators, but, for dct, also the less prominent regulator sox5 was found. it has been reported that sox5 interferes activation of dct by sox10, hence inhibiting expression of dct . however, for the cell lines in our study, we found positive terms for sox5 in our model (positive-values, data not shown). subsequent specific experimental validation may elucidate sox5s regulatory role for dct in these cell lines. milp allowed us to introduce several switches into our originally linear models (switches: selection of tfs, selection of the models of their effects). note that embedding such switches lead to a non-linear and non-convex topology of the search space for these models. this may be compared with a piecewise linear slope (linear part of the model) with substantial breakpoints coming from an abrupt error reduction when switches are used. to some extent, this compares with drastic observations in cell biology as e.g. apoptosis and immortalization at which smoothly (linear) a point-ofno-return is approached after which the destiny of the cellchanges (apoptosis: cell death, in turn, immortalization: malignancy). to our knowledge, such events have not been elaborately described for transcriptional regulation and this would be intriguing research for the future. our approach is generic and can be employed also using other sources of regulation information such as epigenetic modifications and mirna regulation.
