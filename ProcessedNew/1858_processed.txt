systems biology fluxmodecalculator: an efficient tool for large-scale flux mode computation elementary flux mode (efm) analysis is a powerful technique for determining the metabolic capacities and robustness of stoichiometric networks. recently, several improvements have been made to the algorithm for enumerating the efms, making the study of large models possible. however, currently these tools require high performance workstations to perform large-scale efm computations, thus limiting their applicability. we developed a more time and memory efficient implementation of the algorithm for efm enumeration in matlab, called fluxmodecalculator, which enables large-scale efm computation on ordinary desktop computers. availability and implementation: fluxmodecalculator is open source and freely available under the terms of the gnu general public license v3.0 at http://www.lumc.nl/jan-bert-van-klinken contact: j.b.van_klinken@lumc.nl supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online. due to recent advances in genomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic technologies, it has become possible to reconstruct detailed metabolic maps of a wide range of organisms and tissue types. elementary flux mode analysis is a powerful method for investigating the metabolic capacities of these networks, listing the complete set of physiological states that are feasible given mass balance and thermodynamic constraints. efms are defined as the minimal reaction sets that are able to operate at steady state (schuster and hilgetag, 1994) and provide a natural and unbiased definition of a metabolic pathway. efm analysis has been applied for several different purposes, such as designing knockout strategies for bacteria (trinh et al., 2008), analyzing network robustness to perturbations (stelling et al., 2002), determining substrate cycles (gebauer et al., 2012), and investigating network flexibility in optimal growth states (kelk et al., 2012). formally, efm analysis corresponds to enumerating the extreme rays of the polyhedral cone that is formed by the intersection of the right null space of the stoichiometric matrix and the positive orthant
