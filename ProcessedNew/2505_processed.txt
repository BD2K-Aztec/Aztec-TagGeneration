integrating genome assemblies with maia motivation: de novo assembly of a eukaryotic genome with next-generation sequencing data is still a challenging task. over the past few years several assemblers have been developed, often suitable for one specific type of sequencing data. the number of known genomes is expanding rapidly, therefore it becomes possible to use multiple reference genomes for assembly projects. we introduce an assembly integrator that makes use of all available data, i.e. multiple de novo assemblies and mappings against multiple related genomes, by optimizing a weighted combination of criteria.next-generation sequencing (ngs) platforms, such as 454 (roche, branford, ct), solid (ab, foster city, ca) and solexa (illumina, san diego, ca) allow for gigabytes of data generation at an affordable cost. the third generation sequencing platforms (helicos, cambridge, ma; pacific biosciences, menlo park, ca) may even let the cost per megabase drop under $1 per megabase . considering the relatively low cost of these platforms, compared with classical sanger sequencing, it becomes possible to use them for de novo sequencing projects. however, the millions of short dna sequences generated by ngs platforms, called reads, are still relatively small. given this limited read length and the many repetitive regions in a eukaryotic genome, de novo assembly is still a challenging task. to alleviate this problem it is essential to design algorithms that make full use of all available data. over the past few years, several assemblers have been developed for ngs data. assemblers pull millions of reads together into larger contiguous sequences, called contigs. a typical assembly of a eukaryotic genome is a set with thousands of contigs. these contigs are unordered as well as unoriented, i.e. it is unknown whether they come from the forward or reverse strand. the process to determine orientation and relative ordering of contigs is called scaffolding. to whom correspondence should be addressed.some assemblers have built-in scaffolders; otherwise, an external scaffolder can be used, such as bambus . an alternative to de novo assembly is mapping the reads against a finished or draft genome from a close relative (a template). from such a mapping a consensus can be called, generating a comparative assembly . as the number of known genomes is growing rapidly, in the future, it will be more often the case that multiple close relative genomes are available to create such assemblies. however, mapping against a closely related genome will only yield those parts that are identical in target and template genome. to get the unique components in the target genome, a de novo assembly will always be required. assemblers are often specialized for a specific type of reads. de bruijn graph-based assemblers, such as velvet , abyss and allpaths are most suitable for short reads (solid; solexa), whereas overlap-layout-consensus algorithms, such as newbler (roche) and cabog , are more suitable for the longer 454 sequences. it is not trivial to deal efficiently with different read types simultaneously or to combine outputs of different assemblers. hybrid strategies (using two types of sequencing data) mostly work by altering the output of a first assembler to make it suitable for application on a second.generated contigs with vcake using solexa data, which were subsequently used as input to the newbler assembler together with 454 data.simulated sanger reads from a set of contigs assembled by newbler with 454 data. these reads were subsequently used as input to the celera assembler combined with true sanger reads. we are aware of only one de novo assembler designed to integrate sanger and ngs data, called forge . however, forge does not allow for integration of comparative assemblies. other hybrid strategies combine assemblies using minimus . minimus is restricted to only two assemblies, so to combine three or more assemblies it has to be applied iteratively. minimus also does not allow for weighted combinations of contigs. in this article, we describe maia (multiple assembly integrator), a graph-based algorithm for integration of several de novo and comparative assemblies. assembly integration is related to both de novo assembly and scaffolding, but differs in its input. an assembler deals with short sequences (reads) and high genome coverage to account for read errors and repeats in the genome. a scaffolder tries to determine the relative ordering and orientation of large sequences (contigs) of a single de novo assembly, assuming the target genome is covered once. an integrator is a hybrid ofan overlap graph is constructed, in which nodes represent contigs and edges represent overlaps. a forward and a reverse edge is added between the pairs of nodes, but these are indicated by an undirected edge for simplicity. a start node and an end node is determined using a reference genome. edges are assigned weights based on several properties of the alignments and contigs, combined using weighted z-scores. (d) an orientation is assigned to the contigs by traversing the graph depth-first in order of weight (indicated by the numbers). edge 9 [dashed box in (b)] assigns reverse orientation to the blue node, while a forward orientation has already been assigned via edge 1, therefore it is recognized as conflicting and it is removed. (e) oriented contigs and end-to-end overlaps form a directed graph. (f) the highest scoring path is found using a tabu search procedure, which leads to the assembly of a chromosome. these, dealing both with contigs and manifold genome coverage, allowing a number of assemblies to be considered simultaneously. maia is not restricted in the number of assemblies and uses the full contigs produced, not requiring these to be broken into reads or k-mers of any type. pairwise alignments of contigs are calculated to generate an overlap graph. in this graph nodes represent contigs and edges represent alignments. these edges are weighted with several properties of the contigs and alignments, which are combined using weighted z-scores. assemblies are integrated at chromosome level by finding the combination of contigs which yields the highest score. this is achieved by optimizing a path in the overlap graph between the contigs that align closest to the 5 and 3 ends of a reference genome. the assembled chromosome directly follows from this path. the maia approach has two main advantages. first, multiple known related genomes can be used simultaneously in the assembly process. second, different ngs sources can be assembled with specific de novo assemblers, to be integrated afterwards with maia. as a demonstration of the algorithm, maia is applied to the saccharomyces cerevisiae strain cen.pk 113-7d, a strain widely used for systems biology research and metabolic engineering . its genome is assembled using solexa reads, 454 reads and three genomes of previously sequenced, closely related s.cerevisiae strains. the method is compared with two other hybrid approaches, using minimus and velvet.
