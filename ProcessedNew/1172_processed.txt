cormut: an r/bioconductor package for computing correlated mutations based on selection pressure correlated mutations constitute a fundamental idea in evolutionary biology, and understanding correlated mutations will, in turn, facilitate an understanding of the genetic mechanisms governing evolution. cormut is an r package designed to compute correlated mutations in the unit of codon or amino acid mutation. three classical methods were incorporated, and the computation results can be represented as correlation mutation networks. cormut also enables the comparison of correlated mutations between two different evolutionary conditions. availability and implementation: cormut is released under the gnu general public license within bioconductor project, and freely available atin genetics, the ka/ks ratio (or !, dn/ds) is the ratio of the number of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (ka) to the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (ks) , which can be used as an indicator of selective pressure acting on a protein-coding gene. the selection pressure may reflect a change in the function of a gene or a change in environmental conditions that forces the organism to adapt. for example, the mutations to confer resistance of a highly variable virus, e.g. hiv or hcv, to new antiviral drugs may be expected to undergo positive selection in a patient population treated with the drugs against the corresponding virus. the concept of correlated mutations is a fundamental idea in evolutionary biology. the amino acid substitution rates are expected to be limited by functional constraints . given the functional constraints operating on genes, a mutation in one position can be compensated by an additional mutation. as a result, mutation patterns can be formed by correlated mutations responsible for specific conditions. here, we developed an r/bioconductor package to detect the correlated mutations among positive selection sites by combining ka/ks ratio and correlated mutations analysis. cormut is suitable for computing the correlated mutations of highly variable genomes, such as hiv and hcv. random variables, making it possible to measure the correlated mutations between two positions . jaccard index measures the similarity between two variables, and it has been widely used to measure correlated mutations . the computation for correlated mutations consists of two steps: first, the positive selection sites are detected using the selection pressure-based method. second, the mutation correlations are computed among the positive selection sites using the three methods described above. it should, however, be noted that cormut can also be used to compute correlated mutations without considering selection pressure at all. meanwhile, cormut facilitates the comparison of the correlated mutations between two conditions by means of a correlated mutation network.the cormut package provides simple and flexible functionality to compute and display the correlated mutations between codons or amino mutations. the representation of correlation mutations as a network and the ability to compare correlated mutations between two conditions make it possible to understand the genetic mechanisms governing evolution.
