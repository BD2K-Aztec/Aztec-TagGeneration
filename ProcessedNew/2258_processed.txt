databases and ontologies iann: an event sharing platform for the life sciences we present iann, an open source community-driven platform for dissemination of life science events, such as courses, conferences and workshops. iann allows automatic visualisation and integration of customised event reports. a central repository lies at the core of the platform: curators add submitted events, and these are subsequently accessed via web services. thus, once an iann widget is incorporated into a website, it permanently shows timely relevant information as if it were native to the remote site. at the same time, announcements submitted to the repository are automatically disseminated to all portals that query the system. to facilitate the visualization of announcements, iann provides powerful filtering options and views, integrated in google maps and google calendar. all iann widgets are freely available.getting a clear overview of bioinformatics events is not a trivial task . although several efforts have been made in this direction (e.g.), ensuring that information is accurate and reliable, yet secure from malicious attack, requires curators to sift carefully through internet content to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2013. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution non-commercial license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/ by-nc/3.0/), which permits non-commercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. for commercial re-use, please contact journals.permissions@oup.com to identify and annotate pertinent events. in addition to collecting information from other portals, emitting sources typically create announcements about their own events. current methods for dissemination of events in the life sciences are, however, fragmented and uncoordinated: some announcements never reach parts of their intended target audience, and many spam unintended recipients. ideally, announcements should reach all potential event participants, without troubling those for whom they are irrelevant or inappropriate. in practice, however, announcements are typically posted simultaneously to several different sites in an attempt to reach the widest possible audience. this process is both time-consuming for those posting the announcements and bombards recipients with duplicate information about the same event from multiple sites; it also makes it difficult to change the announcement details (e.g. a deadline extension for submission of posters), as it is practically impossible to ensure that updates are propagated to every resource to which the original announcement was sent. in consequence, recipients may be misinformed or confused by announcements of the same event with contradictory dates, speaker changes and so on, which may ultimately damage the reputation of the emitting source. a central point that collects data from event organizers would address many of these problems and provide a valuable resource for life science event organizers and participants, course trainers and so on.
