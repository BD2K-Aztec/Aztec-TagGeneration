genome analysis lep-map: fast and accurate linkage map construction for large snp datasets motivation: current high-throughput sequencing technologies allow cost-efficient genotyping of millions of single nucleotide polymorph-isms (snps) for hundreds of samples. however, the tools that are currently available for constructing linkage maps are not well suited for large datasets. linkage maps of large datasets would be helpful in de novo genome assembly by facilitating comprehensive genome validation and refinement by enabling chimeric scaffold detection, as well as in family-based linkage and association studies, quantitative trait locus mapping, analysis of genome synteny and other complex genomic data analyses. results: we describe a novel tool, called lepidoptera-map (lep-map), for constructing accurate linkage maps with ultradense genome-wide snp data. lep-map is fast and memory efficient and largely automated, requiring minimal user interaction. it uses simultaneously data on multiple outbred families and can increase linkage map accuracy by taking into account achiasmatic meiosis, a special feature of lepidoptera and some other taxa with no recombination in one sex (no recombination in females in lepidoptera). we demonstrate that lep-map outperforms other methods on real and simulated data. we construct a genome-wide linkage map of the glanville fritillary butterfly (melitaea cinxia) with over 40 000 snps. the data were generated with a novel in-house solid restriction site-associated dna tag sequencing protocol, which is described in the online supplementary material. availability and implementation: java source code under gnu general public license with the compiled classes and the datasets are available from http://sourceforge.net/users/lep-map.current high-throughput sequencing technologies, such as whole-genome sequencing and restriction site-associated dna (rad) tag sequencing , allow cost-efficient detection of millions of snps (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and other markers for hundreds of samples. linkage maps constructed from these large datasets would have significant potential in de novo genome assembly, especially in the case of the genomes of non-model species assembled with short sequencing reads. linkage maps can be used to order scaffolds and contigs as well as to validate and refine genomes by detecting chimeric scaffolds. however, current tools for constructing linkage maps are not well suited for large datasets. here, we describe a novel tool, called lep-map (lepidoptera-map) (lm), to construct linkage maps for ultradense genome-wide snp datasets. apart from their use in genome assembly, genome-wide linkage maps are valuable in family-based linkage and association studies and quantitative trait locus mapping by providing increased power and accuracy through multipoint and haplotype-based analyses. morever, genome-wide linkage map enables the analysis of genome synteny and other complex genomic data analyses. traditionally, linkage maps are constructed using crosses of inbred lines . however, such lines are difficult and expensive to create for many non-model species. for example, the glanville fritillary butterfly (melitaea cinxia), a well-established study system in population ecology , has only one generation per year and an obligatory winter diapause. lm was developed for the purposes of the glanville fritillary genome project and was designed to be applied to full-sib families, crosses of individuals sampled from natural populations and their offspring. the present approach is cost-efficient for many non-model species. other novel features of lm include the following. (i) it is largely automated and requires minimal user interaction; (ii) it is fast and memory efficient and produces accurate maps; (iii) it can handle large whole-genome sequencing datasets; (iv) it can analyze multiple outbred families as well as typical inbred crosses; (v) it can select necessary parameters based on their significance; and (vi) it can combine genotype data and genome scaffold information in the construction of linkage maps. finally, lm (vii) can take into account achiasmatic meiosis (recombination in one sex only), a special feature of lepidoptera (recombination in males only) and some other taxa, to correct and impute genotypes.we have described a novel tool, lep-map, which can be used to construct accurate linkage maps for large snp datasets with high rates of noise and missing values, commonly generated by nextgeneration sequencing. lep-map outperformed other methods compared in this study in accuracy on real and simulated data. it is light-weight in computation burden and highly automated, allowing fast and objective linkage map construction.
