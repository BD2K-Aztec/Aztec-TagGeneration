sequence analysis in-depth annotation of snps arising from resequencing projects using ngs-snp ngs-snp is a collection of command-line scripts for providing rich annotations for snps identified by the sequencing of whole genomes from any organism with reference sequences in ensembl. included among the annotations, several of which are not available from any existing snp annotation tools, are the results of detailed comparisons with orthologous sequences. these comparisons can, for example, identify snps that affect conserved residues, or alter residues or genes linked to phenotypes in another species. availability: ngs-snp is available both as a set of scripts and as a virtual machine. the virtual machine consists of a linux operating system with all the ngs-snp dependencies pre-installed. the source code and virtual machine are freely available for download atthe latest sequencing instruments in conjunction with snp discovery tools can be used to identify huge numbers of putative snps. whether the snps are discovered through genome or transcriptome sequencing the next problem after identification is often annotating and choosing functionally important snps. here, we describe a collection of scripts called ngs-snp (next-generation sequencing snp), for performing in-depth annotation of snps identified by popular snp discovery programs such as maq and samtools . ngs-snp can be applied to data from any organism with reference sequences in ensembl, and provides numerous annotation fields, several of which are not available from other tools.
