genome analysis metainter: meta-analysis of multiple regression models in genome-wide association studies motivation: meta-analysis of summary statistics is an essential approach to guarantee the success of genome-wide association studies (gwas). application of the fixed or random effects model to single-marker association tests is a standard practice. more complex methods of meta-analysis involving multiple parameters have not been used frequently, a gap that could be explained by the lack of a respective meta-analysis pipeline. meta-analysis based on combining p-values can be applied to any association test. however, to be powerful, meta-analysis methods for high-dimensional models should incorporate additional information such as study-specific properties of parameter estimates, their effect directions, standard errors and covariance structure. results: we modified method for the synthesis of linear regression slopes recently proposed in the educational sciences to the case of multiple logistic regression, and implemented it in a meta-analysis tool called metainter. the software handles models with an arbitrary number of parameters, and can directly be applied to analyze the results of single-snp tests, global haplotype tests, tests for and under gene gene or geneenvironment interaction. via simulations for two-single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp) models we have shown that the proposed meta-analysis method has correct type i error rate. moreover, power estimates come close to that of the joint analysis of the entire sample. we conducted a real data analysis of six gwas of type 2 diabetes , available from dbgap (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap). for each study, a genome-wide interaction analysis of all snp pairs was performed by logistic regression tests. the results were then meta-analyzed with metainter. availability: the software is freely available and distributed under the conditions specified on http://metainter.the need to summarize the results of related genome-wide association studies (gwas) has encouraged the rapid development of new meta-analytic methods and tools, see e.g. (;). meta-analysis of summary statistics is expected to deliver new susceptibility loci without additional genotype and phenotype data being required . application of the general fixed effects model to single-marker 1 degree of freedom (df) association tests has become a standard practice. more complex models involving multiple parameters have been used much less frequently, presumably in view of power issues but also because of the absence of a respective meta-analysis pipeline. the need for meta-analysis multiple parameter methods has been recognized in the field , and new approaches for performing meta-analysis of rare variant association tests have recently been described in . fishers combination test , stouffers method (or inverse normal method;) and stouffers method with weights are common approaches for combining p-values. however, by design, they do not take advantage of additional information available in high-dimensional models. results of multiple regression analysis, such as parameter estimates, their standard error and covariance, have rarely been used in meta-analysis owing to the complexities underlying the process of their synthesis. in this context, a method for the synthesis of linear regression slopes has been proposed in the educational sciences . the method has been recognized to be useful in genetic epidemiology and has been adapted for linear regression 2 df geneenvironment tests in . the method by involves model parameter estimates and their correlation and provides the overall meta-analytic estimates of regression slopes together with meta-analysis p-values. here, we elaborate the method by for multiple logistic regression model. we introduce the analysis tool metainter, which, besides fishers and stouffers methods, implements the method by for an arbitrary number of model parameters. thereby, metainter enables meta-analysis, for instance, of the single-marker 2 df association test, global haplotype tests and tests for and under genegene or geneenvironment interaction. the synthesis of regression slopes relies on the availability of the covariance matrix of the model parameters. because the covariance matrix is not always provided by genetic analysis tools, we support the analysis framework presented here with an update of our own genetic interaction to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. all rights reserved. for

nucleotide polymorphisms (snp) models and evaluated the data with 8 df logistic regression test under interaction and 4 df logistic regression test for interaction. we show that the method for the synthesis of regression slopes (msrs) has correct type i error. moreover, its power is nearly equal to that of the analysis of the joint sample with covariate parameters indicating sub-study membership. furthermore, we performed a real data analysis of six gwas of type 2 diabetes (t2d), available from dbgap (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap). at first, we conducted a genome-wide interaction analysis (gwia) with 8 and 4 df logistic regression tests in each study, and then meta-analyzed the results with metainter.new methods to meta-analyze genetic data are obviously of growing demand . meta-analysis of summary statistics of single-marker tests applied in gwas is an established standard, which however needs to be extended to more complex multiple parameter testing strategies. in context of rare variant analysis, which typically addresses multiple parameters from a genomic region, an important improvement of p-values combination methods has recently been made by . the method presented there is based on the correlation structure of single-variant test statistics, and, in terms of power, comes close to power of the rare variant analysis of the combined sample. the method for the synthesis of linear regression slopes has been applied to meta-analyze the results of a linear regression geneenvironment interaction test . here, we presented a general framework that enables application of msrs to meta-analysis of both linear and logistic multiple regression models. in addition, a test that assesses across-study heterogeneity can easily be formulated within msrs framework and is a part of our implementation. the method can be used to filter out signals that are driven byp-fisher is p-value of the fishers method; p-stouf is p-value of the stouffers method with weights; p-stoufdir is p-value of the stouffers method with weights and effect directions; p-msrs is p-value of the msrs; p i is p-value of the sub-study i in the primary analysis, i=1;. .. ; 6;

metainter allows efficient computation. meta-analysis of 2.2 million snp pairs analyzed in six studies took metainter 23 min. we supported the analysis by updating our intersnp tool . intersnp provides now the necessary covariance matrix of parameter estimates in multiple regression models. the implementation of msrs in metainter allows efficient meta-analysis for multiple linear and logistic regression models. however, the method should be used with caution, if the evidence of strong dependence between predictor variables exists. the phenomenon of multicollinearity can manifest itself, for example, when the inverse covariance matrix has to be computed. if the model is well specified in each sub-study, there should be no strong multicollinearity. otherwise model reduction can be useful to get around this problem. for gwas with small samples and for snps with low allele frequencies (e.g. both50.2 or for one snp 50.05) a test with fewer parameters, for instance, 3 df allelic test under interaction, might be a reasonable choice. msrs assumes that the multicollinearity issue was checked in sub-studies and that any of them is relatively free from this problem. if the covariance matrix is non-invertible for a particular snp pair (or snp, or snp set) in a sub-study, metainter will exclude the sub-study from the meta-analysis for the respective pair. msrs is an appropriate generalization of the existing techniques in the following sense: in case of one parameter models, the method is equivalent to the fixed effect model, and in the multiple parameter case its power comes close to that of the analysis of the joint sample, as we have shown in our simulation study. moreover, power comparison of msrs with the fishers and the stouffers methods re-emphasizes the importance of going beyond p-valuebased meta-analysis for higher-dimensional models.
