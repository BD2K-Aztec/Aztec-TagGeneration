integrated pathway-level analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics data with impala pathway-level analysis is a powerful approach enabling interpretation of post-genomic data at a higher level than that of individual biomolecules. yet, it is currently hard to integrate more than one type of omics data in such an approach. here, we present a web tool impala for the joint pathway analysis of transcriptomics or proteomics and metabolomics data. it performs over-representation or enrichment analysis with user-specified lists of metabolites and genes using over 3000 pre-annotated pathways from 11 databases. as a result, pathways can be identified that may be disregulated on the transcriptional level, the metabolic level or both. evidence of pathway disregulation is combined, allowing for the identification of additional pathways with changed activity that would not be highlighted when analysis is applied to any of the functional levels alone. the tool has been implemented both as an interactive website and as a web service to allow a programming interface. availability: the web interface of impala is available atsystems biology aims at the concerted analysis of biological systems at different levels, for example the combination of transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. biochemical pathways are the primary focus of systems biology. pathways are extensively used to interpret omics data, for example to gain mechanistic insight into gene disregulation, which is causative or indicative of complex diseases. in particular, pathway over-representation (ora) and enrichment analyses have become important tools for the interpretation of data from transcriptomics and metabolomics experiments.
