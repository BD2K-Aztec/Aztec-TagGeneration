optimal seed solver: optimizing seed selection in read mapping motivation: optimizing seed selection is an important problem in read mapping. the number of non-overlapping seeds a mapper selects determines the sensitivity of the mapper while the total frequency of all selected seeds determines the speed of the mapper. modern seed-and-extend mappers usually select seeds with either an equal and fixed-length scheme or with an inflexible placement scheme, both of which limit the ability of the mapper in selecting less frequent seeds to speed up the mapping process. therefore, it is crucial to develop a new algorithm that can adjust both the individual seed length and the seed placement, as well as derive less frequent seeds. results: we present the optimal seed solver (oss), a dynamic programming algorithm that discovers the least frequently-occurring set of x seeds in an l-base-pair read in ox l operations on average and in ox l 2 operations in the worst case, while generating a maximum of ol 2 seed frequency database lookups. we compare oss against four state-of-the-art seed selection schemes and observe that oss provides a 3-fold reduction in average seed frequency over the best previous seed selection optimizations. availability and implementation: we provide an implementation of the optimal seed solver in c at: https://github.com/cmu-safari/optimal-seed-solverthe invention of high-throughput sequencing (hts) platforms during the past decade triggered a revolution in the field of genomics. these platforms enable scientists to sequence mammalian-sized genomes in a matter of days, which have created new opportunities for biological research. for example, it is now possible to investigate human genome diversity between populations (1000 genomes), find genomic variants likely to cause disease , and study the genomes of ape species and ancient hominids to better understand human evolution. however, these new sequencing platforms drastically increase the computational burden of genome data analysis. first, billions of short dna segments (called reads) are aligned to a long reference genome. each read is aligned to one or more sites in the reference based on similarity with a process called read mapping . reads are matched to locations in the genome with a certain allowed number of errors: insertions, deletions, and substitutions (which usually constitute less than 5 of the reads length). matching strings approximately with a certain number of allowederrors is a difficult problem. as a result, read mapping constitutes a significant portion of the time spent during the analysis of genomic data. pigeonhole principle based seed-and-extend mappers are one kind of popular mappers that have been widely used to aid many biological applications . in pigeonhole based seed-and-extend mappers such as mrfast , razers3 , gem , shrimp and hobbes , each read is partitioned into one or more short segments called seeds. here we define seeds as substrings of a read. this definition is different from the spaced seeds definition (which can be a subsequence, rather than a substring)a concept we will explain in the related works section. seeds are used as indices into the reference genome to reduce the search space and speed up the mapping process. since a seed is a substring of the read that contains it, every correct mapping for a read in the reference genome will also be mapped by the seed (assuming no errors in the seed). therefore, mapping locations of the seeds generate a pool of potential mappings of the read. mapping locations of seeds in the reference genome are pre-computed and stored in a seed database (usually implemented as a hash table or burrows-wheeler-transformation (bwt) (with fm-indexing ) and can be quickly retrieved through a database lookup. when there are errors in a read, the read can still be correctly mapped as long as there exists one seed of the read that is error free. the error-free seed can be obtained by breaking the read into many non-overlapping seeds; in general, to tolerate e errors, a read is divided into e 1 seeds, and based on the pigeonhole principle, at least one seed will be error free. alternatively, a mapper can use overlapping seeds. such mappers follow the q-gram approach in order to achieve full mapping sensitivity (finding all valid mappings that have fewer errors than permitted) or simply select overlapping seeds without guaranteeing the full mapping sensitivity under the given error threshold (e.g. bowtie2 , bwa-mem . compared to the pigeonhole principle (a special case of the q-gram approach), selecting overlapping seeds using the q-gram approach could generate longer, less frequent seeds. however, in order to guarantee full mapping sensitivity, this approach requires selecting a larger number of seeds, which may increase the total number of potential mappings, there by reducing the speed of a mapper. in this work, we focus on seed selection mechanisms based on the pigeonhole principle that provide full mapping sensitivity by selecting non-overlapping seeds. for each selected non-overlapping seed, its locations are further verified using weighted edit-distance calculation mechanisms (such as smithwaterman and needleman wunsch algorithms), to examine the similarity between the read and the reference at each potential mapping site. locations that pass this final verification step (i.e. contain fewer than e substitutions, insertions and deletions) are valid mappings and are recorded by the mapper for use in later stages of genomic analysis. computing the edit-distance is an expensive operation and is the primary computation performed by most read mappers. in fact, speeding up this computation is the subject of many other works in this area of research, such as shifted hamming distance , gene myers bit-vector algorithm and simd implementations of edit-distance algorithms . to allow edits, mappers must divide reads into multiple seeds. each seed increases the number of locations that must be verified. furthermore, to divide a read into more seeds, the lengths of seeds must be reduced to make space for the increased number of seeds; shorter seeds occur more frequently in the genome which requires the mapper to verify even more potential mappings. therefore, the key to building a fast yet error tolerant mapper with high sensitivity is to select many seeds (to provide greater tolerance) while minimizing their frequency of occurrence (or simply frequency) in the genome to ensure fast operation. our goal, in this work, is to lay a theoretically-solid foundation to enable techniques for optimal seed selection in current and future seed-and-extend mappers. selecting the optimal set of non-overlapping seeds (i.e. the least frequent set of seeds) from a read is difficult primarily because the associated search space (all valid choices of seeds) is large and it grows exponentially as the number of seeds increases. a seed can be selected at any position in the read with any length, as long as it does not overlap with other seeds. we observe that there is a significant advantage to selecting seeds with unequal lengths, as possible seeds of equal lengths can have drastically different levels of frequencies. our goal in this paper is to develop an inexpensive algorithm for seed-and-extend mappers based on the pigeonhole principle that derives the optimal placement and length of each seed in a read such that the overall sum of frequencies of all seeds is minimized. this paper makes the following contributions: @bullet it examines the frequency distribution of seeds in the seed database and provides how often seeds of different frequencies are selected using a navenave seed selection scheme. we confirm the discovery of prior works that frequencies are not evenly distributed among seeds and frequent seeds are selected more often under a navenave seed selection scheme. we further show that this phenomenon persists even when using longer seeds. @bullet it provides an implementation of an optimal seed finding algorithm, optimal seed solver, which uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the least-frequent non-overlapping seeds of a given read. we prove that this algorithm always provides the least frequently-occurring set of seeds in a read. @bullet it provides a comparison of the optimal seed solver and existing seed selection optimizations, including adaptive seeds filter in the gem mapper , cheap k-mer selection in fasthash , optimal prefix selection in the hobbes mapper and spaced seeds in patternhunter . we compare the complexity, memory traffic, and average frequency of selected seeds of optimal seed solver with the above four state-of-the-art seed selection mechanisms. we show that the optimal seed solver provides the least frequent set of seeds among all existing seed selection optimizations at reasonable complexity and memory traffic.to build a fast yet error tolerant mapper with high mapping coverage, reads need to be divided into multiple, infrequently occurring seeds. in this way, a mapper can find all correct mappings of the read (mappings with small edit-distances) while minimizing the number of edit-distance calculations that need to be performed. to achieve this goal, we have to overcome two major challenges: (i) seeds are short, in general, and therefore frequent in the genome; and (ii) the frequencies of different seeds vary significantly. we discuss each challenge in greater detail. assume a read has a length of l base-pairs (bp) and x of it is erroneous (e.g. l 80 and x 5 implies that there are 4 edits). to tolerate x l errors in the read, we need to select x l 1 seeds, which renders a seed to be l x l 1-base-pair long on average. given that the desired error rates for many mainstream mappers have been as large as 0.05, the average seed length of a hash-table based mapper is typically not greater than 16-bp . seeds have two important properties: (i) the frequency of a seed is monotonically non-increasing with larger seed lengths and (ii) frequencies of different seeds typically differ (sometimes significantly) .shows the static distribution of frequencies of 10-bp to 15-bp fixed-length seeds from the human reference genome (grch37). this figure shows that the average seed frequency decreases with the increase in the seed length. with longer seeds, there are more patterns to index the reference genome. thus each pattern, on average, is less frequent. from, we can also observe that the frequencies of seeds are not evenly distributed: for seeds with lengths between 10-bp to 15bp, many seeds have frequencies below 100. as the figure shows, a high number of unique seeds, often over 10 3 , correspond to seed frequencies below 100. however, there are also a few seeds which have frequencies greater than 100k (note that such unique seeds are very few, usually 1 per each frequency). this explains why most plots infollow a bimodal distribution; except for 10-bp seeds and perhaps 11-bp seeds, where the frequency of seeds peaks at around 100. although ultra-frequent seeds (seeds that appear more frequently than 10 4 times) are few among all seeds, they are ubiquitous in the genome. as a result, for a randomly selected read, there is a high chance that the read contains one or more of such frequent seeds. this effect is best illustrated in, which presents the numbers of frequencies of consecutively selected seeds, when we map over 4 million randomly selected 101-bp reads from the 1000 genomes project (1000 genomes) to the human reference genome. unlike in, in which the average frequency of 15-bp unique seeds is 5.25, the average frequencies of selected seeds in, we can observe that the ultra-frequent seeds are selected far more often than some of the less frequent seeds, as the selected seed count increases with seed frequencies higher than 10 4 (as opposed to, where seed frequencies over 10 4 usually have seed counts below 10). this observation suggests that the ultra-frequent seeds are surprisingly numerous in reads, especially considering how few ultra-frequent seed patterns there are in total in the seed database (and the plots inno longer follow a bimodal distribution as in). we call this phenomenon the frequent seed phenomenon. the frequent seed phenomenon is explained in previous works . to summarize, highly frequent seed patterns are ubiquitous in the genome, therefore they appear more often in randomly sampled reads, such as reads sampled from shotgun sequencing. frequency distributions of other seed lengths are provided in the supplementary materials section 1.1. the key takeaway from figures 1 and 2 is that although longer seeds on average are less frequent than shorter seeds, some seeds are still much more frequent than others and such more frequent seeds are very prevalent in real reads. therefore, with a navenave seed selection mechanism (e.g. selecting seeds consecutively from a read), a mapper selects many frequent seeds, which increases the number of calls to the computationally expensive verification process during read mapping. to reduce the total frequency of selected seeds, we need an intelligent seed selection mechanism to avoid using frequent patterns as seeds. more importantly, as there is a limited number of base-pairs in a read, we need to carefully choose the length of each seed. extension of an infrequent seed does not necessarily provide much reduction inupon selection, each seed contributes to the frequency counter individually (duplicating seeds will be counted multiple times by each selection) the total frequency of all seeds, but it will consume base-pairs that could have been used to extend other more frequent seeds. besides determining individual seed lengths, we should also intelligently select the position of each seed. if multiple seeds are selected from a small region of the read, as they are closely packed together, seeds are forced to keep short lengths, which could potentially increase their seed frequency. thus, seed selection must be done carefully to minimize the total frequency of seed occurrence. based on the above observations, our goal in this paper is to develop an algorithm that can calculate both the length and the placement of each seed in the read such that, the total frequency of all seeds is minimized. we call such a set of seeds the optimal seeds of the read as they produce the minimum number of potential mappings to be verified while maintaining the sensitivity of the mapper. we call the sum of frequencies of the optimal seeds the optimal frequency of the read.as shown in the section 5, oss requires ol 2 seed-frequency lookups in order to derive the optimal solution of a read. for a non-trivial seed database implementation such as bwt with fm-index, this can be a time consuming process. for reads that generate equally frequent seeds in oss and other seed selection mechanisms, oss could be less beneficial as it generates more queries of seed frequencies to the seed database without reducing the total seed frequency. when such reads are prevalent (very unlikely), oss might not be the ideal seeding mechanism. one workaround under this event is to combine oss with other greedy seed selection algorithms (e.g. cks, ops). in such a configuration, oss will only be invoked when greedy seed selection algorithms fail to deliver infrequent seeds. however, how to combine different seeding mechanisms is beyond the scope of this paper and will be explored in our future research. the optimal seed solver also revealed that there is still great potential in designing better greedy seed selection optimizations. from our experiment, we observe that the most effective greedy seed selection optimization still provides 3 more frequent seeds on average than optimal. better greedy algorithms that provide less frequent seeds without a large number of database lookups are also part of our future research.optimizing seed selection is an important problem in read mapping. the number of selected non-overlapping seeds defines the error tolerance of a mapper while the total frequency of all selected seeds in the reference genome determines the performance of the mapper. to build a fast yet error tolerant mapper, it is essential to select a large number of non-overlapping seeds while keeping each seed asoptimal seed solverinfrequent as possible. in this paper, we confirmed the frequent seed phenomenon discovered in previous works , which suggests that in a navenave seed selection scheme, mappers tend to select frequent seeds from reads, even when using long seeds. to solve this problem, we proposed the optimal seed solver (oss), a dynamic-programming algorithm that finds the optimal set of seeds that has the minimum total frequency. we further introduced four optimizations to oss: optimal divider cascading, early divider termination, divider sprinting and optimal solution forwarding. using all four optimizations, we reduced the average-case complexity of oss to ox l, where x is the total number of seeds and l is the length of the read; and achieved a ox l 2 worst-case complexity. we compared oss to four prior studies, adaptive seeds filter, cheap k-mer selection, optimal prefix selection and spaced seeds and showed that oss provided a 3-fold seed frequency reduction over the best previous seed selection scheme, optimal prefix selection. we conclude that oss is an efficient algorithm that can find the best set of seeds, which can potentially improve the performance of future read mappers.
