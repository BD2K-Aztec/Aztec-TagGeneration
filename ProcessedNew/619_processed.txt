structural bioinformatics automatic generation of protein structure cartoons with pro-origami protein topology diagrams are 2d representations of protein structure that are particularly useful in understanding and analysing complex protein folds. generating such diagrams presents a major problem in graph drawing, with automatic approaches often resulting in errors or uninterpretable results. here we apply a breakthrough in diagram layout to protein topology cartoons, providing clear, accurate, interactive and editable diagrams, which are also an interface to a structural search method. availability: pro-origami is available via a web server at
