somaticsniper: identification of somatic point mutations in whole genome sequencing data motivation: the sequencing of tumors and their matched normals is frequently used to study the genetic composition of cancer. despite this fact, there remains a dearth of available software tools designed to compare sequences in pairs of samples and identify sites that are likely to be unique to one sample. results: in this article, we describe the mathematical basis of our somaticsniper software for comparing tumor and normal pairs. we estimate its sensitivity and precision, and present several common sources of error resulting in miscalls. availability and implementation: binaries are freely available for download atsecond-generation sequencing technologies have been applied to several cancer types to identify somatic mutations in an unbiased, genome-wide manner . in terms of raw numbers, the most common somatic alteration is the single nucleotide variant (snv). these studies have proceeded by utilizing a variety of methods for identifying somatic snvs, and have used the number and distribution of such changes in the genome to infer the driving forces behind tumorigenesis, as well as the degree to which tumors have been altered . in addition, the detection of these changes within coding regions led to the discovery of candidate driver mutations in genes such as: dnmt3a , idh1 , foxl2 and arid1a (the strategy used to identify somatic snvs has varied among studies, but ultimately has hinged on the direct comparison of sequences from the tumor and matched normal tissue either during discovery or validation. previous studies have relied on simple subtractions of tumor and normal genotype calls to determine somatic status , hard thresholds on read support or individual processing of genomes followed by comparison of likelihoods . our own approach has revolved around the whole genome sequencing (wgs) of the tumor and matched normal to depths of 25x30x and subsequent comparison to discover mutations specific to the tumor. in addition, our initial focus on leukemia prompted consideration of sample impurities and their implications for the detection of snvs. here we present our software, somaticsniper, which employs a bayesian comparison of the genotype likelihoods in the tumor and normal, as determined by the germline genotyping algorithm implemented in the maq software package. we test the algorithm on simulated data to estimate its detection power. additionally, we evaluate our associated somatic snv detection pipeline on external data for sensitivity and on internal validation data for an estimation of precision. finally, we examine sequence features associated with an elevated false positive rate, especially the beginning of illuminas read segment quality control indicator, which is an extended run of base quality 2 (q2) bases at the 3 end of a read.as a result of our work sequencing leukemia genomes, we developed a method for identifying potentially somatic mutations. our algorithm, previously referred to as glfsomatic (manuscript category: original paper), explicitly calculates the likelihood of genotype difference between two genomes at all positions with coverage in both and reports variants in the tumor along with a somatic score, a phred-scaled value indicating the likelihood that the site is not somatic.the detection of somatic snvs in tumors is an important part of tumor resequencing because these mutations can be directly relevant to the disease and are the most numerous. one method of discovering somatic snvs is to compare the sequencing results between a matched tumor and normal pair. to this end we developed somaticsniper to directly compare the tumor and normal reads and calculate the probability that the two samples have identical genotypes in both samples.our simulations on the algorithm show that it should be able to detect most mutations if the mutation is present in the majority of cells, and the normal is relatively pure. we have evaluated somaticsniper on external data and found it to be more sensitive than other methods and, based on the total number of calls, of comparable specificity. additionally, we have explored the precision of our algorithm by validating predicted somatic mutations on internally generated data. in contrast to our simulations, which suggested an fdr 15 if mapping error is non-existent, this validation experiment demonstrated a higher fdr. our subsequent investigations revealed a number of reliable indicators that a predicted variant was, in fact, not real. most interestingly, we identify an association of false positive bases with the illumina q2 base quality designation. this new feature may also prove useful in other false positive reduction techniques, such as base quality recalibration. by implementing some statistical and empirical filters, we were able to greatly increase the validation rate on both our training set and four independent datasets with only a small number of validated somatic mutations failing the filters. while our precision is low on the aml sample, this is expected since there are a smaller number of detectable events due to both tumor cells in the normal sample and a lower mutation rate for this cancer type. in solid tumors, where neither problem is likely to be as severe, we expect that the precision should be similar to that observed on the tested breast cancer tumors. despite the success of somaticsniper on the colo-829 data, this dataset represents an ideal case for somatic snv calling and there remains room for improvement in future work. since colo829 is a cell line, it represents the simple case of a perfectly pure, homogenous tumor with a perfectly pure, homogenous matched normal. cancer projects will rarely work with such an ideal sample and tumors can be expected to contain multiple subclones with varying expected allele frequencies depending on their site-specific copy number and abundance within the tissue sample. indeed, the internal data with which we evaluated our precision were obtained from a patient with a high white blood cell count (105 000 cells per microliter) and our data indicate that 30 of the cells from the normal sample were, in fact, tumor . in addition, the tumor sample will likely be impure in many cases. while the matched normal can be expected to be free of tumor cells for most samples, this may not always be the case (especially for liquid tumors that circulate into all tissues, and for solid tumors where the matched normal tissue is obtained from adjacent tissue). our simulation studies demonstrate the rapid decline of detection power that occurs when the normal sample contains tumor cells. this is due, in part, to the assumptions of the maq genotyping model underlying somaticsniper, which currently operates by ignoring the copy number state and sample purity. this is true for snvmix2 as well, since it derives its expected genotype frequencies from training on germline variants. optionally, our caller can take into account the prior knowledge that somatic snvs are expected to be rare, although our testing suggests that incorporating such a penalty significantly reduces the sensitivity of the algorithm at current wgs coverage levels (supplementary). as outlined above, these assumptions are inappropriate for optimal somatic snv calling and future improvements in somatic snv calling must take these issues into account. sites predicted to be somatic by our method will include both true mutations and some false positives. the number of false positives is likely to be a function of the quality of the reference sequence, the alignments, the data quality and the ability to accurately provide error estimates to the software. while our filters increase precision, fully specified error models or adjustments to the error estimates provided in the mapping qualities and base qualities of the data ought to improve the specificity and sensitivity of these filters.
