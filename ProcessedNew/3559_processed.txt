sequence analysis picmi: mapping point mutations on genomes motivation: several international collaborations and local projects are producing extensive catalogues of genomic variations that are supplementing existing collections such as the omim catalogue. the flood of this type of data will keep increasing and, especially, it will be relevant to a wider user base, including not only molecular biologists, geneticists and bioinformaticians, but also clinical researchers. mapping the observed variations, sometimes only described at the amino acid level, on a genome, identifying whether they affect a gene andif sowhether they also affect different isoforms of the same gene, is a time consuming and often frustrating task. results: the picmi server is an easy to use tool for quickly mapping one or more amino acid or nucleotide variations on a genome and its products, including alternatively spliced isoforms.the availability of novel high-throughput technologies for identifying variations, both pathological and physiological, in sequenced genomes is producing a wealth of data that is readily available to researchers. these data will continue to be produced at an unprecedented speed not only in projects based on large international collaborations, but also in individual labs and will add to existing collections such as omim , swissprot (the uniprot) and the related mutation portal swissvar . it can be easily foreseen not only that more and more data will be available, but also that the scientists who will need to access and analyze them will not be limited to molecular biologists, geneticists and bioinformaticians, as it has been mostly the case so far, but will include clinical researchers and in the future also medical doctors. this implies that tools to easily access and interpret these data should be provided to the community and that they have to be simple, reliable and user-friendly. given one or more variations of interest, one needs to map them back to the corresponding genome, verify in which region they fall and, if they map to a coding region, understand whether they affect, and in which way, one or more of the isoforms of the gene. this task is not made easier by the fact that the version of the genome might have changed since the time of identification of the mutation.
