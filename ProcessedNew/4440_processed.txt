systems biology stringgaussnet: from differentially expressed genes to semantic and gaussian networks generation motivation: knowledge-based and co-expression networks are two kinds of gene networks that can be currently implemented by sophisticated but distinct tools. we developed stringgaussnet, an r package that integrates both approaches, starting from a list of differentially expressed genes. contact: henri-jean.garchon@inserm.fr availability and implementation: freely available on the web at http://cran.r-project.org/web/pack-ages/stringgaussnet.analysis of genes differentially expressed (de) depending on a condition has become a standard procedure in current biology. however, identification of biologically relevant de genes is far from being trivial. yet efficient prioritization of de genes is an essential step before undertaking rate-limiting wet lab experiments . in this regard, the network theory appears as a powerful framework. the aim is to connect genes (the nodes) by means of their interactions, the edges . these interactions may be based on prior knowledge, curated and stored in databases, or extracted from the experimental dataset, e.g. using coexpression information . sophisticated but distinct tools are available to implement either one of these approaches separately. we introduce stringgaussnet, an r package that allows inferring gene networks starting from a list of de genes by integrating both of these approaches with ease and flexibility.
