improved synapse detection for mgrasp-assisted brain connectivity mapping motivation: a new technique, mammalian green fluorescence protein (gfp) reconstitution across synaptic partners (mgrasp), enables mapping mammalian synaptic connectivity with light microscopy. to characterize the locations and distribution of synapses in complex neuronal networks visualized by mgrasp, it is essential to detect mgrasp fluorescence signals with high accuracy. results: we developed a fully automatic method for detecting mgrasp-labeled synapse puncta. by modeling each punctum as a gaussian distribution, our method enables accurate detection even when puncta of varying size and shape partially overlap. the method consists of three stages: blob detection by global thresholding; blob separation by watershed; and punctum modeling by a variational bayesian gaussian mixture models. extensive testing shows that the three-stage method improved detection accuracy markedly, and especially reduces under-segmentation. the method provides a goodness-of-fit score for each detected punctum, allowing efficient error detection. we applied this advantage to also develop an efficient interactive method for correcting errors. availability: the software is available on http://an important challenge in neuroscience is to map the synaptic connectivity of neuronal networks in mammalian brains. among advanced technologies for mapping connectivity, the fluorescencebased mgrasp stands as a markedly powerful tool for comprehensive studies of synaptic circuits in mammalian brains. the mgrasp technique is based on fluorescence that is reconstituted when two non-fluorescent split gfp fragments targeted to the synaptic membranes in two separate neuronal populations are closely opposed across the synaptic cleft; thus, fluorescence uniquely indicates a synapse. computational methods including image stitch, neuron reconstruction and synapse detection have been applied successfully to investigate the locations and distributions of synapses in dendritic compartments and in neurons labeled with mgrasp. in our previous study, computational analysis for synapse detection achieved 93 accuracy. here we introduce optimizations to improve synapse detection and other tasks. detecting mgrasp-labeled synapses is complicated by the low signal-to-noise ratios of the original images, the variety of the sizes and shapes of fluorescent puncta, and signal overlap from neighboring puncta . to overcome these difficulties, we previously applied a method based on gaussian template matching followed by blob merging . but, lacking a to whom correspondence should be addressed.splitting procedure, this method frequently suffered from undersegmentation, which is the error of counting multiple puncta as one. although no other method had been developed specifically for punctum detection in mgrasp images, the problem is closely related to fluorescent particle detection (e.g. gfp-labeled peroxisomes and glut4), for which several methods have been published . however, most of these methods are not suitable for mgrasp-labeled punctum detection because they cannot accommodate particles featuring a wide range of sizes, irregular shapes and degrees of overlap or they are not readily extended into three dimensions. for example, evaluated several 2d particle detection methods and found that multiscale variance-stabilizing transform (msvst) and h-dome transform based methods offered the best performance among unsupervised methods. however, both these methods assume that the particles are well separated. msvst takes any connected foreground feature as a particle without providing any splitting correction, and h-dome based method treats foreground clusters as noise. neither methodwe developed a fully automated puncta-like object detection algorithm based on distinctive morphological features of puncta, i.e. a punctum has a convex shape and its center is brighter than surrounding voxels. marker-controlled watershed is used to detect puncta with clear centers and mean-shift modified vbgmms is used to separate puncta by exploiting their convex shapes. simple gmms often emphasize the distribution of data. the mean-shift and merge procedure in post-processing can make sure that fitted gaussians not only have appropriate shapes but also have stable centers. our method achieved very high accuracy from the detection of puncta in real images. parameters needed for our algorithm are intuitive and easy to choose. only t m used for watershed marker selection needs to change for different application or data. it represents the expected center voxel number which is proportional to average puncta size. however, post-processing of the detected result is necessary since our method may pick up some image noise. this procedure is relatively easy because we can compute many kinds of features for each detected punctum. in our experience, maximum intensity and radius are good choices for filter conditions. we process our detection result by removing punctum with radii smaller than 1 and maximum intensity less than t +. t is global image threshold we calculated in the binarization stage. sigma is an empirical choice based on the visibility of corresponding puncta. typically it is chosen from 10 to 20 for an 8-bit image. although only rarely, we found some cases in which our algorithm did not work as expected. based on our analysis of testing data, we found under-segmentation usually occurs when several small elongated puncta are clustered together, like the position marked in. since such a feature is elongated and consists of few voxels, it tends to be fitted by a gaussian with an axis larger than its actual radius. then mean-shift uses this overestimated radius value to adjust the gaussian position, which can end up in the middle of several small puncta. over-segmentation occurs when large saturated puncta have unusual shapes. our method might separate it into several convex shapes. in such cases, the actual number of puncta can be hard to determine, even by an expert biologist. fortunately, these saturated big puncta are easy to spot and can be treated differently. our method for calculating the confidence scores of puncta can readily help us locate these problematic regions.
