data and text mining predicting biodegradation products and pathways: a hybrid knowledge-and machine learning-based approach motivation: current methods for the prediction of biodegradation products and pathways of organic environmental pollutants either do not take into account domain knowledge or do not provide probability estimates. in this article, we propose a hybrid knowledge-and machine learning-based approach to overcome these limitations in the context of the university of minnesota pathway prediction system (um-pps). the proposed solution performs relative reasoning in a machine learning framework, and obtains one probability estimate for each biotransformation rule of the system. as the application of a rule then depends on a threshold for the probability estimate, the trade-off between recall (sensitivity) and precision (selectivity) can be addressed and leveraged in practice. results: results from leave-one-out cross-validation show that a recall and precision of 0.8 can be achieved for a subset of 13 transformation rules. therefore, it is possible to optimize precision without compromising recall. we are currently integrating the results into an experimental version of the um-pps server.in silico methods to predict products and pathways of microbial biotransformations of chemical substances are increasingly sought due to rapidly growing data requirements for regulatory chemical risk assessment at the european (cf. reach) and global level. existing methods for the prediction of biotransformation products and pathways can be categorized as either knowledge-or machine learning-based approaches. each of the two approaches has its strengths and weaknesses. knowledge-based approaches, such as meteor for the prediction of mammalian metabolism or the university of minnesota pathway predictionpage: 815 814821
