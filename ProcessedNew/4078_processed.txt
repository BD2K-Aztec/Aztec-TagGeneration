bioinformatics discovery note gene expression rrna:mrna pairing alters the length and the symmetry of mrna-protected fragments in ribosome profiling experiments motivation: ribosome profiling is a new technique that allows monitoring locations of translating ribosomes on mrna at a whole tran-scriptome level. a recent ribosome profiling study demonstrated that internal shinedalgarno (sd) sequences have a major global effect on translation rates in bacteria: ribosomes pause at sd sites in mrna. therefore, it is important to understand how sd sites effect mrna movement through the ribosome and generation of ribosome footprints. results: here, we provide evidence that in addition to pausing effect, internal sd sequences induce a caterpillar-like movement of mrna through the ribosome cavity. once an sd site binds to the ribosome, it remains attached to it while the ribosome decodes a few subsequent codons. this leads to asymmetric progressive elongation of ribosome footprints at the 3 0-end. it is likely that internal sd sequences induce a pause not on a single, but on several adjacent codons. this finding is important for our understanding of mrna movement through the ribosome and also should facilitate interpretation of ribosome profiling data. contact: brave.oval.translation initiation sites in bacteria usually consist of a start codon (most frequently aug, gug or uug) and a purine reach region 610 nt upstream, termed a shinedalgarno (sd) sequence . the sd sequence binds to the small ribosomal subunit through complementary interactions with an anti-shinedalgarno (asd) sequence located at the 3 0end of 16s rrna (3 0-auuccuccac). the importance of sd sequences for translation initiation is well known; its presence is routinely verified in algorithms for start codon prediction in bacteria . until recently, the known role of internal sd sequences was limited to its stimulatory effect on ribosomal frameshifting inbacteria . recent single-molecule studies revealed that internal sd sites can arrest ribosome movement along mrna . application of the ribosome profiling technique (2009) to the analysis of protein synthesis in bacteria demonstrated that this effect is pervasive . it was shown that ribosome density is positively correlated with the presence of strong sd sequences, and strong sdasd interactions cause pausing of elongating ribosomes. under conditions of fast growth, the sd site effect on translation rates seems to be more significant than that of other known coding sequence features, such as codon bias . however, the pausing effect of sd sequences on elongating ribosomes cannot explain all the empirical observations regarding its stimulation of ribosomal frameshifting. indeed the effect of an sd site on frameshifting is strictly determined by its position relative to the frameshift site. for stimulation of 1 ribosomal frameshifting, an sd site needs to be located just 3 nt upstream of the p-site codon , whereas stimulation of 1 frameshifting requires a distance of 1014 nt . in bacterial release factor 2 gene, which has a programmed frameshift site, not only the sd site but also its distance from the frameshift site is highly conserved . in addition to interference with a trna in the e-site , the position specificity of sd site effect on frameshifting could be due to tensions imposed on the bulk of mrna located between the decoding center and an sd:asd duplex. a simple analogy for such tensions is a spring effect illustrated on. a short spacer is expected to produce a stretched spring effect promoting a movement of codons in the 5 0 direction relative to trnas (trnas move forward). a long spacer is expected to produce the opposite compressed spring effect. the model illustrated inrequires sd site to be able to interact with asd at a range of distances from the decoded codon. such interactions would force mrna to move through a ribosome in a caterpillar-like rippling fashion. this could occur only if ribosomes are capable of accommodating variable amount of mrna between the sd:asd duplex and the decoding center. in this case, ribosomes would remain bound to the same sd site while decoding several subsequent codons leading to asymmetric progressive extension of ribosome footprints as shown in. in this work, we analyzed ribosome profiling data obtained for escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis and have shown that the length and distribution of ribosome footprints at sd site-containing mrna regions is consistent with the caterpillar model of progressive footprint extension. to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author(s) 2013. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.
