shrimp2: sensitive yet practical short read mapping we report on a major update (version 2) of the original short read mapping program (shrimp). shrimp2 primarily targets mapping sensitivity, and is able to achieve high accuracy at a very reasonable speed. shrimp2 supports both letter space and color space (ab/solid) reads, enables for direct alignment of paired reads and uses parallel computation to fully utilize multi-core architectures.high throughput sequencing (hts) machines produce datasets of 50200 million reads of 32400 base pairs (bp) per run. the first step in the analysis of hts datasets is mapping the reads to a reference genome, which is followed by specialized processing tools that aim to identify signals (e.g. genomic variants or high coverage peaks) from the mappings. mapping hts reads to a large reference genome is a non-trivial computational task, and the various read mapping programs that have been developed in recent years target different speed-accuracy trade-offs. programs that primarily target speed are typically based on (near-)exact string matching methods, whereas programs that primarily target sensitivity (alignment of reads with high polymorphism, or to a distant reference) are often based on projections with spaced seeds. for a recent survey of the current read mapping programs, see . here we report on a major update (version 2) of the short read mapping program . shrimp2 primarily targets mapping accuracy, enabling the alignment of reads with extensive polymorphism and sequencing errors, while featuring a significant speedup over previous versions. shrimp2 supports fasta and fastq input, sam output, illumina/solexa, roche/454 and ab/solid reads, a paired mapping mode, parameters for mirna mapping, and parallel computation.
