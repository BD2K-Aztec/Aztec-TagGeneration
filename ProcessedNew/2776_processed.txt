gene expression magi: a node.js web service for fast microrna-seq analysis in a gpu infrastructure magi is a web service for fast microrna-seq data analysis in a graphics processing unit (gpu) infrastructure. using just a browser, users have access to results as web reports in just a few hours4600 end-to-end performance improvement over state of the art. magis salient features are (i) transfer of large input files in native fasta with qualities (fastq) format through drag-and-drop operations, (ii) rapid prediction of microrna target genes leveraging parallel computing with gpu devices, (iii) all-in-one analytics with novel feature extraction, statistical test for differential expression and diagnostic plot generation for quality control and (iv) interactive visu-alization and exploration of results in web reports that are readily available for publication.micrornas (mirnas) are short, single-stranded and nonprotein-coding rnas, with an average size of 22 bases that silence target genes either by degradation of mrna level or repression of a translated protein. mirnas have generated great interest by the biomedical community because of their implications in human disease and development. the advent of high-throughput short-read sequencing has enabled comprehensive mirna studies. there are several web services for mirna-seq data analysis targeting the needs of non-technical users. deep-sequencing small rna analysis pipeline (dsap) quantifies known mirnas, while miranalyzer , computational platform analysis of small rna deep sequencing data (cpss) and waprna perform novel mirna prediction and and enriched pathways. in this article, we introduce four novel features of magi. technical details are provided in the supplementary material. 1magi natively accepts large fastq format files as input, requiring no additional file processing by the user. for instance, in, with a simple drag and drop into the browser, six fastq files are added to the processing queue using html5 webworkers that scan over the short reads and compress each sequence from a 3gb fastq file down to a 3 mb read-count hash-table file, completely within the browser. this process makes the processed data small enough to reach our server in just a few seconds. the adoption of webworkers technology reduced the end-to-end analysis time of 24 micrornaseq samples (total size 48 gb) down to 4 h using a 2012 macbook air with 1.3 ghz dual core cpu, 4 gb ram, 500 gb hdd. comparatively, when using omiras, the fastq input file transfer time alone took 5 h. miranalyzer and mirtools require file preprocessing that alone took 57 h before uploading them to the web service. 2magi uses our parallel implementation of miranda , a widely used cpu algorithm for mirna target identification. its compute unified device architecture c implementation modifies and parallelizes the smithwaterman algorithm to return multiple alignment results with the corresponding trace-back sequences plus heuristic rules for mirnas. four nvidia m2090 gpu devices (6 gb memory) are installed in our magi server and reduced the prediction time from hours using just the cpu to a few minutes using the gpu devices additionally. 3magi predicts novel mirs using a novel feature-extraction algorithm and random forest-based classifier in just minutes . with mirdeep2 , a widely used novel mir prediction algorithm, the prediction module alone took 1216 h with the same 24 samples. then, a list of differentially expressed mirnas between two groups is tabulated using the deseq r package that performs a statistical test for both known and novel mirnas with multiple samples. for quality control, magis web-socket module collects diagnostic statistics and plots such as average quality score, length distribution of trimmed reads and guanine-cytosine contents at the time of fastq file drag and drop by a user. 4magi generates d3 and jquery-enabled charts where users can zoom in/out, mouse over for actual numbers and export them as separate image files. tables and pile-up charts are interactive as users can sort and filter with different cutoff values. such powerful visualization features enable users to discover signals and patterns.
