efficient bayesian inference under the structured coalescent motivation: population structure significantly affects evolutionary dynamics. such structure may be due to spatial segregation, but may also reflect any other gene-flow-limiting aspect of a model. in combination with the structured coalescent, this fact can be used to inform phylogenetic tree reconstruction, as well as to infer parameters such as migration rates and subpopulation sizes from annotated sequence data. however, conducting bayesian inference under the structured coalescent is impeded by the difficulty of constructing markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) sampling algorithms (samplers) capable of efficiently exploring the state space. results: in this article, we present a new mcmc sampler capable of sampling from posterior distributions over structured trees: timed phylogenetic trees in which lineages are associated with the distinct subpopulation in which they lie. the sampler includes a set of mcmc proposal functions that offer significant mixing improvements over a previously published method. furthermore, its implementation as a beast 2 package ensures maximum flexibility with respect to model and prior specification. we demonstrate the usefulness of this new sampler by using it to infer migration rates and effective population sizes of h3n2 influenza between new zealand, new york and hong kong from publicly available hemagglutinin (ha) gene sequences under the structured coalescent. availability and implementation: the sampler has been implemented as a publicly available beast 2 package that is distributed under version 3 of the gnu general public license at http://compevol. github.io/multitypetree. contact:model-based phylogenetic inference has become one of the principal methods of using genetic sequence data to test scientific hypotheses pertaining to evolving populations. its wide-spread adoption has been driven not only by improvements in computational and sequencing hardware but also by advances in methods of statistical inference. an important initial step in this development was the derivation of the n-coalescent process , which probabilistically ties the shape of a rooted phylogenetic tree of n randomly chosen individuals to the parameters of an underlying wrightfisher population genetics model. in conjunction with felsensteins pruning algorithm , this allowed for the computational inference of the sample genealogy itself alongside population genetic parameters, such as the effective population size. since these beginnings, an array of sophisticated models and inference methods has been developed, allowing molecular mutation rates, population size histories and other population genetic parameters of interest to be inferred alongside increasingly sophisticated phylogenetic tree reconstructions, which, for example, do away with the assumption of a strict molecular clock . rapidly evolving populations such as viruses and bacteria are of particular interest, as such populations may undergo significant demographic variation over timescales comparable with the age of the genealogy of sampled data. such data form the basis of the emerging field of phylodynamics , which exploits these overlapping timescales by using the genetic data to select and infer parameters of sophisticated epidemiological models. many of the models that are of interest to population geneticists and epidemiologists are structured in some way. this structure may represent the spatial subdivision of a population into several distinct demes, or it may represent some other logical categorization of individuals such as the temporal subdivision used in compartmental epidemiological models. such structure can strongly affect the shape of inferred genealogies , and can provide a source of statistical bias when ignored. a time-tested means of including this structure in phylogenetic analyses is through the use of the structured coalescent , an extension of kingmans coalescent in which the unstructured wrightfisher model is replaced by a structured equivalent encompassing a number of discrete subpopulations. phylogenetic analyses based on this model are capable of both (i) reducing model misspecification bias in the inference of the genealogy and (ii) estimating parameters specific to structured models such as migration rates and effective subpopulation sizes. while similar, this model is distinct from the character-based treatment of lineage locations used by, in that the structured coalescent allows to whom correspondence should be addressed.schemes for conducting inference under the structured coalescent exist in the literature. both of these schemes use an mcmc algorithm to explicitly sample both the demographic and evolutionary model parameters and the structured genealogy: a phylogenetic tree annotated with individual migration events. the first of these schemes is the method of beerli and felsenstein , which is implemented in the software package migrate-n. at its core, this method involves a single proposal function, which updates the structured tree by dissolving a randomly selected edge and drawing a new edge by simulating from the structured coalescent conditional on the remaining edges. the other scheme is the work of, who have published a set of simple and fast proposal functions that act solely on the migration events on the structured genealogy. in combination with those for traversing the space of unstructured trees , ewing et al. showed that an mcmc algorithm based on these moves is capable not only of jointly inferring the structured tree and migration model parameters, but also of exploiting the additional information contained in serially sampled data to infer absolute migration rates. while certainly functional and useful, this scheme suffers from performance issues, which arise in the form of slow mixing, meaning that mcmc calculations must be run for a long time to obtain useful information about the posterior probability distribution. an additional issue is that no implementation of the sampler has been made widely available. in this article, we introduce a new set of mcmc proposal functions (or operators) that provide an efficient means of using serially sampled sequence data to infer the full structured tree and related model parameters (including mutation rates) under the structured coalescent. these operators, together with the data structure representing the structured tree itself and the probability density calculation algorithm for the structured coalescent, are implemented and distributed as a package extension to beast 2 (; http://www.beast2.org). when applied to equivalent data, and assuming equivalent evolutionary models and parameter priors, this new package yields posterior distributions, which are exactly equivalent to those obtained using migrate-n. however, the use of the beast 2 platform for our implementation gives our sampler access to a large array of molecular evolution models and parameter priors not yet available in migrate-n. additionally, we have implemented the operators described by ewing et al., allowing direct comparison between the two sampling methods. this comparison shows that the new operators achieve significantly faster mixing when applied to simulated data, with an order of magnitude improvement in some cases. we go on to demonstrate the practicality of the new sampler by using it to infer mutation rates, effective population sizes and the structured tree from geographically annotated ha gene sequences derived from the influenza a subtype h3n2 strain. we interpret these results in light of recent work by).taken together, the results above are strong evidence that our new algorithm and its implementation are correct, computationally efficient and capable of analysing large datasets. however, the algorithm presented here does not address problems that are fundamental to the structured coalescent. as discussed in detail by, the structured coalescent tree density. summary of results from spatial h3n2 influenza analysis, including (a)
