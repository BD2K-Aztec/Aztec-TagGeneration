genome analysis maldiquant: a versatile r package for the analysis of mass spectrometry data maldiquant is an r package providing a complete and modular analysis pipeline for quantitative analysis of mass spectro-metry data. maldiquant is specifically designed with application in clinical diagnostics in mind and implements sophisticated routines for importing raw data, preprocessing, non-linear peak alignment and calibration. it also handles technical replicates as well as spectra with unequal resolution. availability: maldiquant and its associated r packages readbrukerflexdata and readmzxmldata are freely available from the r archive cran (http://cran.r-project.org).mass spectrometry profiling is increasingly becoming an important tool in clinical diagnostics, for example to identify biomarkers for cancer (e.g.). similarly as with other high-throughput technologies, sophisticated statistical algorithms are essential in the analysis of spectrometry data . we have developed maldiquant to provide a complete opensource analysis pipeline on the r platform (r development) comprising all steps from importing of raw data, preprocessing (e.g. baseline removal), peak detection and non-linear peak alignment to calibration of mass spectra. maldiquant is written as a standalone package using s4 object-oriented programming to facilitate further extension. maldiquant was initially developed for clinical proteomics using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (maldi) technology. however, the algorithms implemented in maldiquant are generic and may be equally applied to other 2d mass spectrometry data.
