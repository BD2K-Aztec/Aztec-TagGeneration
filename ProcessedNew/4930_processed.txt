genome analysis wrangling galaxy's reference data thegalaxy is a web-based platform for performing large-scale data analysis. it is a completely open-source project that supports accessible, reproducible and transparent computational research and is available through the use of free public servers, private local installations and by launching instances in the cloud. at the heart of galaxy is its ability to integrate disparate data sources and analysis tools into a unified interface. galaxy comes prepackaged with a default set of analysis tools, but additional tools can be defined locally or installed from a community-curated resource known as the galaxy toolshed (https://usegalaxy.org/toolshed). when a tool is executed within galaxy, all of the users selections and parameters are recorded, providing provenance and enabling reproducible data analysis. when executing a tool installed from the galaxy toolshed, not only are input parameters recorded, but specific tool and dependency versions are also controlled; this enables reproducibility across time and between different galaxy instances. one weakness in this reproducibility is the reliance of many tools on built-in reference data, such as reference genome sequences or short-read mapper indexes (see supplementary). until now, galaxy administrators have been responsible for downloading, building and installing these important reference data. for example, to make the ucsc hg19 build of the human reference genome available to the burrows-wheeler aligner (bwa) short-read mapper , a galaxy administrator would need to (i) download the reference genome fasta file, (ii) make it available as a reference genome via the all_fasta table (optional), (iii) build bwa alignment indexes via proper command-line calls, (iv) register the location and availability of the indexes within the bwa_indexes data table (by adding an additional entry to the tool-data/bwa_index.loc file on disk) and (v) finally, restart the galaxy server. although not technically challenging, each one of the previously mentioned manual steps is prone to error and lacks any provenance; any incorrectness or incompleteness of built-in data will have a severe impact on the correctness of a subsequent analysis. worse yet, it may not even be apparent that something has been configured incorrectly, creating a situation where invalid results are trusted. data manager tools remove the technical burdens of ensuring the reproducibility and provenance of built-in reference data from the hands of the galaxy administrator and make it an automated point-and-click process. a new menu option, manage local data, has been added to the galaxy administrator interface. accessing this option enables an administrator to run data manager tools, inspect the results of individual data manager executions and view the current state of galaxys built-in data registries. running a data manager uses the same familiar interface as a standard galaxy tool, allowing an administrator to configure the data manager with desired options (e.g. dbkey, source reference fasta file, indexing algorithm). on completion of a data manager tool run, the datathis is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. and values. these values are enabled in real time and persisted to disk. restarting the galaxy server is not required for enabling the new entries; however, the new entries will remain after a restart. although the data manager framework negates the need for the manual curating of reference data, it is compatible with any previously existing policy or process in-use for a galaxy installation.
