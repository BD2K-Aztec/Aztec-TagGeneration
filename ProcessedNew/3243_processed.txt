structural bioinformatics networkview: 3d display and analysis of protein √Å rna interaction networks networkview is an application for the display and analysis of protein rna interaction networks derived from structure and/or dynamics. these networks typically model individual protein residues and nucleic acid monomers as nodes and their pairwise contacts as edges with associated weights. networkview projects the network onto the underlying 3d molecular structure so that visualization and analysis of the network can be coupled to physical and biological properties. networkview is implemented as a plugin to the molecular visualization software vmd.the usefulness of 2d contact network visualization in the study of protein function has already been demonstrated leading to the development of software to display these networks . the networkview extension to the visual molecular dynamics (vmd) program was developed to help structural biologists study allostery and molecular signaling through network models of protein rna complexes in translation . residues essential for molecular recognition and reaction mechanisms at different states of the system can be determined by using molecular dynamics (md) simulations to calculate variations in contacts and displaying the resulting interaction networks and their properties directly onto the 3d structure . as networks are increasingly used to study the function and dynamics of biological macromolecules, the informative display of network data directly onto 3d representations of biomolecules is needed .networkview provides high-level, interactive views of dynamic and/or structure networks that enable the analysis and interpretation of molecular signaling. projection of these networks onto 3d biomolecular structures is useful for rapidly identifying residues which can be targeted in mutagenesis experiments to test mechanistic hypotheses.
