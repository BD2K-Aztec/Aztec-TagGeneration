discovering transcriptional modules by bayesian data integration motivation: we present a method for directly inferring transcriptional modules (tms) by integrating gene expression and transcription factor binding (chip-chip) data. our model extends a hierarchical dirichlet process mixture model to allow data fusion on a gene-by-gene basis. this encodes the intuition that co-expression and co-regulation are not necessarily equivalent and hence we do not expect all genes to group similarly in both datasets. in particular, it allows us to identify the subset of genes that share the same structure of transcriptional modules in both datasets. results: we find that by working on a gene-by-gene basis, our model is able to extract clusters with greater functional coherence than existing methods. by combining gene expression and transcription factor binding (chip-chip) data in this way, we are better able to determine the groups of genes that are most likely to represent underlying tms.approaches to the elucidation of gene regulatory networks have often relied on the use of clustering methodologies, grouping genes on the basis of expression patterns over time, treatments and/or tissues. the genes in a given cluster are usually assumed to be potentially functionally related or to be influenced by common upstream factors. for example,found that in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, genes that clustered together did indeed often share similar biological function, and a large number of subsequent authors have found the same, sometimes even being able to verify the results experimentally (e.g.). application of these approaches to gene expression data have led to the recognition that gene regulation is often performed by regulatory programmes or transcriptional modules (tms); sets of co-regulated genes that share a common biological function and are regulated by a common set of transcription factors.devised a method for identifying tms by assigning genes to clusters in a context-dependent manner. a gene could be assigned to several clusters, resulting in overlapping tms, a feature which is biologically meaningful since a gene could be involved in multiple biological processes. clustering on the basis of expression data alone, however, only indicates co-expression, and does not directly identify co-regulation. to whom correspondence should be addressed.the expression patterns of genes in the same cluster may be correlated for reasons other than co-regulationthe effects of experimental measurement error may be important, for example. due to the complexity of gene regulatory networks, as well as the limitations of any given source of noisy experimental data, it is advantageous to make tm inferences using multiple sources of data. in addition to gene expression data, a range of other data types have been used to enhance the reconstruction of gene networks. these include information about transcription factor binding derived from experimental techniques such as chip-chip, sequence data and even information derived from relevant scientific literature. bothhave described methods to integrate expression and sequence data within the framework of a probabilistic graphical model, using the method of expectation maximization a statistical technique for maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters from incomplete data.applied a variant of this approach to infer regulatory modules in s.cerevisiae, together with their component regulators, under the assumption that the regulators themselves are transcriptionally regulated, at least under a subset of conditions.described a method to integrate chip-chip and expression data based on an exhaustive iterative search over possible combinations of regulators, which identifies a subset of gene targets with highly correlated expression patterns. dirichlet process mixture models are a class of bayesian non-parametric models that has been widely used for clustering . dpms have the interesting property that the prior probability of a new data point joining a cluster is proportional to the number of points already in that cluster, thus encoding a natural clustering tendency. clustering strength is controlled via a hyperparameter , which sets the expected number of clusters as a function of the number of clustered items. by inferring we can therefore determine the posterior distribution of the number of clusters. hierarchical dirichlet process models [hdpms as defined byare the hierarchical extension of dpms. they consist of a dpm for each of a number of different contexts, with the mixture components for each context being drawn from a master list of mixtures from the next level of the hierarchy. a wider range of hdpms are reviewed in teh and jordan (2010).use a type of hdpm to identify tms from transcription factor binding site sequence data.use hdpms to model gene expression programs in a variety of tissues. effective combination of different datasets can be an effective way to identify tms.introduced a hdpm that assigns a dpm to each of a pair of datasets (e.g. gene expressionthe results of each data integration analysis are rich and detailed. in this section, we consider a number of metrics and highlight significant aspects of the results for each dataset. for comparison, we also run clustering analyses using the bhc algorithm to analyse the gene expression data alone. this gives us a baseline result with which to compare the data integration results. it is important to assess the convergence of any mcmc analysis. all analyses on the galactose dataset comprise 20 mcmc chains, each of 50 000 samples (after removal of 10 000 burn-in samples). all analyses on the cell cycle data set comprise 20 mcmc chains, each of 5000 samples (after removal of 1000 burn-in samples). to speed up our subsequent analyses, we sparse sample each chain by a factor of 10. we include as supplementary material plots of 1d hyperparameter posterior pdfs, both overall and for each mcmc chain. these demonstrate that the mcmc analyses are converging adequately. we also perform geweke convergence tests on the hyperparameters of each chain ( 0 and ) for the w = 0.5 case. for the galactose dataset, we find 30 of 40 tests (20 chains, 2 hyperparameters) have a z-score 2, with a maximum outlier of 3.48. for the cell cycle dataset, we find 28 of 40 tests have a z-score 2, with a maximum outlier of 5.53. we conclude that our chains are reasonably well (although not perfectly) mixed, although in both cases it is important that we combine multiple chains. the algorithm is implemented in matlab and run on 3 ghz cluster nodes (20 in parallel, one per mcmc chain). on the galactose utilization dataset (205 genes), the code produces 500 samples per chain per hour. on the cell cycle dataset (1165 genes), the code produces 40 samples per chain per hour. on a larger sample of 2332 genes [from the stress data of, the code produces 10 samples per chain per hour. this scaling suggests that for large (genome-scale) datasets it may be of value to investigate (for example) fast variational methods as an alternative to mcmc.both gene expression and chip-chip data contain information about the biological functions of different genes, but it is non-trivial to combine them in a sensible way, both due to their noisy nature and also because co-expression and co-regulation may not necessarily be equivalent for all genes. our results show that by treating data fusion on a geneby-gene basis, the model we present here is able to produce superior extraction of functionally coherent groups of genes from a combination of gene expression and chip-chip data. our model also has special cases (given by w = 0 and w = 1) that produce data integration results that outperform the single dataset analyses (including a fast bhc clustering using expression data only). however, the model we present is both more flexible and outperforms these special cases in both the examples we have considered in this article. the key innovation in our model is that the data integration is treated on a gene-by-gene basis. this allows crucial flexibility because we can distinguish between genes that are likely to be fused and those that are not. we can extract genes that are closely related on the basis of both datasets, while rejecting those that are not. it is these genes that are most likely to represent the underlying tms.
