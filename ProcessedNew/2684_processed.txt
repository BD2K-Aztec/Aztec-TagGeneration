structural bioinformatics lddt: a local superposition-free score for comparing protein structures and models using distance difference tests motivation: the assessment of protein structure prediction techniques requires objective criteria to measure the similarity between a computational model and the experimentally determined reference structure. conventional similarity measures based on a global super-position of carbon atoms are strongly influenced by domain motions and do not assess the accuracy of local atomic details in the model. results: the local distance difference test (lddt) is a superposition-free score that evaluates local distance differences of all atoms in a model, including validation of stereochemical plausibility. the reference can be a single structure, or an ensemble of equivalent structures. we demonstrate that lddt is well suited to assess local model quality, even in the presence of domain movements, while maintaining good correlation with global measures. these properties make lddt a robust tool for the automated assessment of structure prediction servers without manual intervention. availability and implementation: source code, binaries for linux and macosx, and an interactive web server are available at http://swissthe knowledge of a proteins 3d structure enables a wide spectrum of techniques in molecular biology, ranging from rational design of mutagenesis experiments for the elucidation of a proteins function to drug design. while the rapid development of dna sequencing techniques has been providing researchers with a wealth of genomic data, experimental structure determination techniques require substantially more effort, and consequently the gap between the number of known protein sequences and the number of known protein structures has been growing continuously. to fill this gap, various computational approaches have been developed to predict a proteins structure starting from its amino-acid sequence . despite remarkable progress in structure prediction methods, computational models often fall short in accuracy compared with experimental structures. the biannual casp experiment (critical assessment of techniques for protein structure prediction) provides an independent blind retrospective assessment of the performance of different modeling methods based on the same set of target proteins . one of the main challenges for the casp assessors is to define appropriate numerical measures to quantify the accuracy with which a prediction approximates the experimentally determined structure. in the course of the casp experiment, model comparison techniques have evolved to reflect the current state of the art of prediction techniques: in the first installments of casp, root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) between a prediction and the superposed reference structures was used in various forms as the main evaluation criterion . however, rmsd has several characteristics that limit its usefulness for structure prediction assessment: the score is dominated by outliers in poorly predicted regions while at the same time it is insensitive to missing parts of the model, and it strongly depends on the superposition of the model with the reference structure. to overcome some of the limitations of rmsd in the context of casp, the global distance test (gdt) was introduced in casp4 . in contrast to rmsd, the gdt is an agreement-based measure, quantifying the number of corresponding atoms in the model that can be superposed within a set of predefined tolerance thresholds to the reference structure. for each threshold, different superpositions are evaluated and the one giving the highest number is selected. the final gdt score is then calculated as the average fraction of atoms that can be superposed over a set of predefined thresholds (0.5, 1, 2 and 4 a for gdt-ha and 1, 2, 4 and 8 a for gdt-ts, respectively). one of the advantages of gdt is that strongly deviating atoms do not considerably influence the score. at the same time, missing segments in the predictions lead to lower scores. besides gdt, several other scores for model comparison have been developed to overcome the limitations of rmsd . one of the main limitations of measures based on global superposition becomes evident when applied to flexible proteins composed of several domains, which can change their relative orientation naturally with respect to each other . typically in those cases, the global rigid-body superposition is dominated by the largest domain, and as a consequence, the smaller domains are not correctly matched, resulting in artificially unfavorable scores. in casp, the effects of domain to whom correspondence should be addressed. ythe authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first two authors should be regarded as joint first authors. the author 2013. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the

evaluated separately. the definition of aus is carried out by visual inspection, and is therefore time-consuming. furthermore, the criteria used to define the au are often subjective . grishin et al. have proposed an approach to numerically support this decision by analyzing the variability among the predictions for a specific target . local superposition-free measures based on rotation-invariant properties of a structure are an attractive alternative to overcome several of the shortcomings outlined before. for example, drmsdthe distance-based equivalent of rmsdis used in chemoinformatics to assess differences in ligand poses in binding sites . in casp9, the local distance difference test (lddt) score was introduced, assessing how well local atomic interactions in the reference protein structure are reproduced in the prediction . more recently, other nonsuperposition-based scores have been proposed, e.g. cad score based on residueresidue contact areas , measures using residue contact similarity or the recall, precision, f-measure (rpf)/dp score, which was initially developed to evaluate the quality of nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) structures . also, the spheregrinder score was used for the assessment of local accuracy of refinement targets in casp9 . initially, most of the scores used in structure prediction assessment aimed at the evaluation of the protein backbone or fold, thereby focusing on carbon (c) atom positions. however, with increasing accuracy of prediction methods for templatebased models, the focus of the assessment has shifted to the evaluation of the atomic details of a model. in casp7, the first scores based on local atomic interactions were introduced in the form of hbscore, which quantifies the fraction of hydrogen bond interactions in the target protein correctly reproduced in the model . in casp8, several scores for assessing the local modeling quality were introduced (main chain reality score, hydrogen bond correctness, rotamer correctness and side-chain positioning) , as well as an evaluation of the stereochemical realism and plausibility of models using the molprobity score . in this article, we expand the initial concept of lddt. because the lddt score considers all atoms of a prediction including all side-chain atoms, it is able to capture the accuracy of, e.g. the local geometry in a binding site, or the correct packing of a proteins core. we discuss its properties with respect to its low sensitivity to domain movements, and the significance that can be assigned to the absolute score values. furthermore, we introduce the concept of using multiple reference structures simultaneously, and incorporate stereochemical quality checks in its calculation. we finally illustrate how lddt can be used to highlight regions of low model quality, even in models of multidomain proteins where domain movements are present.
