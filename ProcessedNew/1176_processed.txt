systems biology correcting for link loss in causal network inference caused by regulator interference motivation: there are a number of algorithms to infer causal regulatory networks from time series (gene expression) data. here we analyse the phenomena of regulator interference, where regulators with similar dynamics mutually suppress both the probability of regulating a target and the associated link strength; for instance, interference between two identical strong regulators reduces link probabilities by $50. results: we construct a robust method to define an interference-corrected causal network based on an analysis of the conditional link probabilities that recovers links lost through interference. on a large real network (streptomyces coelicolor, phosphate depletion), we demonstrate that significant interference can occur between regulators with a correlation as low as 0.865, losing an estimated 34 of links by interference. however, levels of interference cannot be predicted from the correlation between regulators alone and are data specific. validating against known networks, we show that high numbers of functional links are lost by regulator interference. performance against other methods on dream4 data is excellent. availability and implementation: the method is implemented in r and is publicly available as the niacs package at http://www2. warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/systemsbiology/research/software.the falling costs of global gene expression (transcriptome) measurement by microarrays, and more recently next-generation sequencing, has spurred the development of network inference techniques . of particular interest, given their direct bearing on mechanisms of regulation and information flow through the cell, is the identification of causal regulatory signals, the associated directed (causal) networks and regulatory pathways. time series experiments potentially capture these signals, but because of low temporal resolution of transcriptome data, only simple models can be used for analysis. the most basic is a linear auto-regression model ,where x t i is the (log) expression level of gene i (i=1;. .. ; g) at time t (t=1;. .. ; t), b ij is the connectivity strength, i the additive constant and t i gaussian noise n0; 1 i , (precision i ). despite the simplicity of these models, inference is computationally intensive given the high number of regressors; expression data on 100010 000s of genes is typical depending on the experimental conditions and organism, and potentially greater if gene models (rna splicing/transcripts) are distinguished. a factor that considerably aids identification of regulatory links in these systems is the fact that biological networks are sparse, i.e. the connectivity matrix b=b ij is sparse with the average number of regulators per gene being much smaller than the number of genes. part of this sparsity results from the fact that only a subset of genes (more specifically, their associated proteins) can be regulators; the set of potential regulators can thus be restricted a priori to those identified from bioinformatic/literature considerations as potential regulators, thereby reducing computation considerably. sparse network models use gibbs variable selection methods to determine which elements of the matrix b are present in the regression; specifically, the prior on b ij allows it to be zero with finite probability. the indicator ij 2 f0; 1g of a link j ! i determines if b ij is non-zero (when ij =1), while b ij = 0 if ij =0. the indicator is modelled as a bernoulli distribution with a prior probability of being non-zero, ij j$ber ij j, while has a beta prior $b ej 0:5; 0:5 . let d denote the time series gene expression data fx t i g and the model parameters f i ; i ; ij ; b ij g. the likelihood is then given bythe associated posterior can then be sampled using the bioconductor package grenits (http://www.bioconductor.org/ packages/2.12/bioc/html/grenits.html). in network models, interference has a direct bearing on the posterior probability of links being present. specifically in these to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. sparse network models, ij =1 j d is reduced if there is another regulator k with similar dynamics to j. in the case of an exact identity between the dynamics of j and k, there are three identical regression models: ij =1; ik =0; ij =0; ik =1 and ij =1; ik =1, and thus the probability of any one, and therefore of ij =1j d is reduced. the relative weighting of these three states is determined by the prior link probability , which is low in sparse networks, thereby downweighting the double link case; therefore, only the two states ij =0; ik =1 and ij =1; ik =0 need to be considered, effectively halving ij =1jd relative to the case when k is excluded from the network (proof in section 2.1.1). a key problem is gauging when regulators might interfere, specifically how interference decreases with a diminishing correlation between these regulators and thus deciding how to select which regulators to use in the regression. failing to deal with this appropriately means that key regulators might be missed because they are part of a correlated set of regulators, and their link probabilities fall below threshold through mutual interference. we developed a framework for solving this problem based on the analysis of conditional posterior link probabilities that identifies the interfering sets of regulators. this allowed us to define an interference-corrected causal network and, further, the relative weights of the interfering regulators reflecting their likely contribution to the control of a given gene. the article is organized as follows. in section 2, we analyse the impact of identical regulators on network links, demonstrating that the link probabilities of identical strong regulators are essentially additive. we give a numerical demonstration of the theory on an augmented experimental dataset, doubling up a key regulator. in section 3, we develop a framework to correct for interference in network construction, a post-processing step that clusters regulators and calculates regulator interference within clusters for each target. in section 4, we illustrate our method on three experimental datasets that give rise to networks with distinct architectures and demonstrate that interference is data specific, there being no simple relationship between interference and regulator correlation. further, we provide evidence that the recovered links are functional. in section 5, we discuss the impact of these issues and the generality to other inference/ fitting methods.in this article, we have proposed a method for dealing with the problem of regulators with similar dynamics suppressing causal link signals in the auto-regression model equation (1). by analysis of the level of interference between highly correlated regulators (computed from the posterior conditional link probabilities), we are able to correct for link suppression by near identical regulators, and thus recover regulator links that would otherwise be lost because their posterior link probabilities are reduced below threshold. we defined an icn n! ; that includes as a subnetwork the original network n1; , i.e. our method only adds links lost by interference. the icn is defined at the value of the correlation threshold ! where interfering regulators are judged to be optimally clustered as measured by a score that sums over weighted-links; our score punished clustering of inconsistent regulators through a lack of mutual interference or no interference. our approach avoids a subjective subselection of the set of predefined regulators, i.e. all regulators should be included in the inference in absence of prior information, and, by a postprocessing step, interference is corrected. in effect, we are assuming that there are potentially multiple regulators for a target, but network inference is hampered by insufficient dynamic data to separate signals from (individual) regulators with similar dynamics. determining whether there are two true regulators as opposed to one is not possible without additional experimental data, e.g. experiments under conditions where the regulators have distinct dynamics or conducting experiments with strains where either regulator is expressed under an inducible promotor. our method crucially prevents loss of both regulators from the inferred network. we demonstrated that the recovered-links for phop and the arabidopsis circadian clock are functional, with precision at least as good as that for the predicted-links. in a comparison against other network inference methods on simulated data (dream4), grenits is already highly competitive, while performance is further improved when coupled with niacs to correct for regulator interference, the area under precision recall curve increasing on average by 10 (supplementary). most of the improvement is in the crucial high confidence predictions (supplementary). niacs outperformed the other methods in 10 of 14 cases. for the icn n! ; , we assign the link probability as the maximum of the posterior link probability and the conditional probability (if applicable). however, we do not expect the conditional probability ij =1jd; ik =0; 8k 2 cr s ! nfjg to truly reflect the probability of regulator j regulating i, as this is dependent on the clustering set cr s ! . in essence, if there are multiple regulators, they all affect the dynamics (if on), and a true measure of their regulatory effects is in the presence of the other regulators. therefore, we recommend that-links arising from interference remain distinguished because their probabilities are corrected and thus a direct comparison with-links may be misleading. however, the relative weighting within a cluster of regulators according to their conditional posterior probabilities is a reflection of the evidence in the data as to the identity of the true regulator. the identity of this true regulator may also be discerned by using additional experiments or gene annotations. these data can also be used as prior information in grenits restricting allowable links, thereby removing some of the regulator ambiguity. our analysis on three real datasets demonstrated that interference is not simply a function of regulator correlation. in the phosphate depletion causal network (example 1), for two highly correlated regulators, we found a spread of interference among their targets comprising a set of targets on which interference is mutual, whereas other targets have only a sole regulator despiteregulator interference their high correlation; interference is thus heterogeneous on the set of targets. these observations mean that interference must be analysed on a per experiment, per target basis and the optimal correlation threshold determined in each case. in addition to regulator interference, we also observed another phenomenon in our networks, whereby two (or more) regulators enhance the causal signals of each other; specifically, the regulators have elevated posterior link probabilities in the presence of each other. we define pairwise synergistic regulators j, k on target i as regulators with ij =1jd; ik =1jd4, ij = 1 jd; ik =0; ik =1jd; ij =05 (this definition can be easily generalized to the case of multiple regulators). causal signal synergy between regulators was rare, with 3, 3 and 1 synergistic regulators in examples 1, 2 and 3, respectively (supplementary). we emphasize that neither interference nor synergy between the causal signals implies that a mechanistic interference/synergy exists. link suppression/ enhancement from interference/synergy in our context arises because of similarity (correlation) in the regulator dynamics. interference between dynamically similar regulators in causal network inference is a general problem. it will occur in any statistical hypothesis testing methodology for the model in equation 1. for instance, as the weights b ij in equation 1 are suppressed under interference, and their variance increases under a lack of (a posteriori) identifiability, any test for a non-zero coefficient will be subject to loss of highly correlated regulator links (see section 4.2 of supplementary material). in this article, we have provided a methodology to recover missing (suppressed) links within a bayesian context through a post-processing of the network posterior samples.
