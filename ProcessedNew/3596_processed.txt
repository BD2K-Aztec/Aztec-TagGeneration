poly(a) motif prediction using spectral latent features from human dna sequences motivation: polyadenylation is the addition of a poly(a) tail to an rna molecule. identifying dna sequence motifs that signal the addition of poly(a) tails is essential to improved genome annotation and better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and stability of mrna. existing poly(a) motif predictors demonstrate that information extracted from the surrounding nucleotide sequences of candidate poly(a) motifs can differentiate true motifs from the false ones to a great extent. a variety of sophisticated features has been explored, including sequential, structural, statistical, thermodynamic and evolutionary properties. however, most of these methods involve extensive manual feature engineering, which can be time-consuming and can require in-depth domain knowledge. results: we propose a novel machine-learning method for poly(a) motif prediction by marrying generative learning (hidden markov models) and discriminative learning (support vector machines). generative learning provides a rich palette on which the uncertainty and diversity of sequence information can be handled, while discriminative learning allows the performance of the classification task to be directly optimized. here, we used hidden markov models for fitting the dna sequence dynamics, and developed an efficient spectral algorithm for extracting latent variable information from these models. these spectral latent features were then fed into support vector machines to fine-tune the classification performance. we evaluated our proposed method on a comprehensive human poly(a) dataset that consists of 14 740 samples from 12 of the most abundant variants of human poly(a) motifs. compared with one of the previous state-of-the-art methods in the literature (the random forest model with expert-crafted features), our method reduces the average error rate, false-negative rate and false-positive rate by 26, 15 and 35, respectively. meanwhile, our method makes $30 fewer error predictions relative to the other string kernels. furthermore, our method can be used to visualize the importance of oligomers and positions in predicting poly(a) motifs, from which we can observe a number of characteristics in the surrounding regions of true and false motifs that have not been reported before.roughly speaking, when dna is transcribed to rna, a string of adenine (a) nucleotides, referred to as the polyadenylation tail or the poly(a) tail, is added to the 3 0-end of the primary rna transcript. such a process is called polyadenylation, which is a step to protect rna stability, nuclear export and translation . a poly(a) tail is $1030 nt downstream of a signaling site that consists of 6 nt, which in human cells most commonly is aauaaa . this signaling site is known as a poly(a) signal and the corresponding 6 nt subsequences in dna are called poly(a) motifs. mutations in poly(a) signals can be associated with diseases, e.g. colorectal cancer and compromised immunodeficiency . the poly(a) signal prediction problem has been studied for decades . there are two versions of the problem: predicting poly(a) signals in mrna sequences and predicting poly(a) motifs in dna sequences. intuitively, the former version is much simpler than the latter one because once the mrna sequence is given, the poly(a) tail can be identified relatively easily and we need only to search for the poly(a) signal(s) in a window of at most 30 nt upstream the poly(a) tail. in dna, however, the presence of introns in eukaryotes and the absence of poly(a) tails make the recognition much more challenging. a number of studies have demonstrated that information from relatively short upstream and downstream sequences of the candidate poly(a) motifs can specify the true poly(a) motifs to a great extent (;). statistical properties of the surrounding sequences were explored in different species, such as yeast (van), fly , arabidopsis and rice and human . although significant progress has been made to the accuracy of poly(a) motif predictors, especially in human dna sequences, such methods are all based on using sophisticated features that require additional efforts to extract and are highly dependent on domain knowledge. we therefore ask the following question: can we use machine-learning techniques to automatically extract useful features from human dna sequences and achieve state-of-the-art poly(a) motif classification results? if the answer to this question is yes, then we can automate this genome annotation task to a great extent and to whom all correspondence should be addressed. the author 2013. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution non-commercial license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/ by-nc/3.0/), which permits non-commercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. for commercial re-use, please contact journals.permissions@oup.com potentially speed up our understanding of the underlying biology. automatic feature extraction techniques have been explored in many other sequence classification problems. by far, the most successful methods are hidden markov models (hmms), e.g. in gene finding , and string kernels with support vector machines (svm), e.g. in protein classification , transcription start-site recognition and splice-site prediction . the former methods are generative models that capture the uncertainty in data using probabilistic languages, while the latter are discriminative methods that optimize specifically for the classification results. the advantages of each class of methods have rarely been combined systematically to yield even better feature extractors. in this article, we propose a novel method for poly(a) motif prediction by marrying generative learning (hmms) and discriminative learning (svms). generative learning provides us with a rich palette for handling the uncertainty and diversity of sequence information, while discriminative learning allows us to directly optimize performance for the classification task. here, diversity means that for the same position in the surrounding sequence of a candidate poly(a) motif, there may be multiple subsequences indicating the class label (a true motif or a false one), and uncertainty means that each of these subsequences does not give deterministic information about the class label. in particular, we use hmms as a probabilistic generative model for dna sequences, and develop an efficient spectral algorithm for extracting latent variable information from these models. the hmms model not only the diversity and uncertainty of sequence information, but also long-range dependencies between subsequences at different positions, which cannot be simultaneously captured by string kernels as is discussed in section 2.2. the spectral latent features are then fed into support vector machines to fine-tune the classification performance.
