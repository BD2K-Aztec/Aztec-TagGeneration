genetics and population analysis popoolation2: identifying differentiation between populations using sequencing of pooled dna samples (pool-seq) sequencing pooled dna samples (pool-seq) is the most cost-effective approach for the genome-wide comparison of population samples. here, we introduce popoolation2, the first software tool specifically designed for the comparison of populations with pool-seq data. popoolation2 implements a range of commonly used measures of differentiation (f st , fishers exact test and cochran-mantel-haenszel test) that can be applied on different scales (windows, genes, exons, snps). the result may be visualized with the widely used integrated genomics viewer.next-generation sequencing of pooled dna samples (allows the comparison of population samples on a genomic scale, thus facilitating the transition from single marker studies to population genomics. due to its cost-effectiveness , pool-seq can be used for a range of applications. the most intuitive application is the comparison of natural populations to perform standard population genetic analyses on a genomic scale (e.g.). the comparison of natural arabidopsis lyrata populations from different habitats allowed the characterization of genes involved in heavy metal tolerance . also in experimental evolution studies, pool-seq has been used to identify genomic regions that show high differentiation between different selective treatments . finally, pool-seq offers an enormous potential for selective genotyping . while several tools for analyzing pool-seq data of single populations are already available , to our knowledge no standalone software to whom correspondence should be addressed. tool is available for the comparison of pool-seq data for multiple populations. popoolation2 is a software tool dedicated to the comparison of allele frequencies between populations.
