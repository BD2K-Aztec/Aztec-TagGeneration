gene expression samstrt: statistical test for differential expression in single-cell transcriptome with spike-in normalization motivation: recent transcriptome studies have revealed that total transcript numbers vary by cell type and condition; therefore, the statistical assumptions for single-cell transcriptome studies must be revisited. samstrt is an extension code for samseq, which is a statistical method for differential expression, to enable spike-in normaliza-tion and statistical testing based on the estimated absolute number of transcripts per cell for single-cell rna-seq methods. availability and implementation: samstrt is implemented on r and available in github (https://github.com/shka/r-samstrt).unbiased molecular measurements are required to form precise hypotheses on molecular mechanisms, and measurements at single-cell resolution can give detailed snapshots of heterogeneous cell cultures or tissues. recently described single-cell mrna sequencing technology is one promising method for such purposes . however, the statistical assumptions in the traditional tests for differential expression are not necessarily applicable, as the total mrna molecules per cell could be different by cell types , and sensitivity over the experiments is less consistent than in the other methods that use large amounts of input mrna. one possible solution is the addition of a known number of spike-in control rna molecules to each cell lysate, which can be used to normalize and convert read counts to (estimated) molecule numbers. in the present study, we used the single-cell tagged reverse transcription (strt) method to investigate key issues for statistical tests, in several control experiments, and then implement and demonstrate a new concept for differential expression test on single-cell transcriptome profiles.
