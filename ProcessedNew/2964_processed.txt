miec-svm: automated pipeline for protein peptide/ligand interaction prediction motivation: miec-svm is a structure-based method for predicting protein recognition specificity. here, we present an automated miec-svm pipeline providing an integrated and user-friendly workflow for construction and application of the miec-svm models. this pipeline can handle standard amino acids and those with post-translational modifications (ptms) or small molecules. moreover, multi-threading and support to sun grid engine (sge) are implemented to significantly boost the computational efficiency. availability and implementation: the program is available ataccurate prediction of the binding specificity of proteins, particularly those whose interacting partners are conformationally flexible, remains a great challenge. many computational methods have been developed to meet this challenge and one of them is the miec-svm method. this method has been successfully applied to predict the binding specificity of diverse systems including sh3 domains , pdz domains , chromodomains and hiv protease . here, we present an automated miec-svm pipeline that allows users to predict interacting partners using the existing miec-svm models as well as to construct new models for the protein families of their own interest.the miec-svm method is a powerful tool to predict the binding specificity of proteins. the pipeline presented here automates the model training and prediction, which will greatly facilitate the broader application of this method.
