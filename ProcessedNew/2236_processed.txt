genome analysis htseqâ€”a python framework to work with high-throughput sequencing data motivation: a large choice of tools exists for many standard tasks in the analysis of high-throughput sequencing (hts) data. however, once a project deviates from standard workflows, custom scripts are needed. results: we present htseq, a python library to facilitate the rapid development of such scripts. htseq offers parsers for many common data formats in hts projects, as well as classes to represent data, such as genomic coordinates, sequences, sequencing reads, alignments, gene model information and variant calls, and provides data structures that allow for querying via genomic coordinates. we also present htseq-count, a tool developed with htseq that preprocesses rna-seq data for differential expression analysis by counting the overlap of reads with genes.the rapid technological advance in high-throughput sequencing (hts) has led to the development of many new kinds of assays, each of which requires the development of a suitable bioinformatical analysis pipeline. for the recurring big tasks in a typical pipeline, such as alignment and assembly, the bioinformatics practitioner can choose from a range of standard tools. for more specialized tasks, and to interface between existing tools, customized scripts often need to be written. here we present htseq, a python library to facilitate the rapid development of scripts for processing and analysing hts data. htseq includes parsers for common file formats for a variety of types of input data and is suitable as a general platform for a diverse range of tasks. a core component of htseq is a container class that simplifies working with data associated with genomic coordinates, i.e. values attributed to genomic positions (e.g. read coverage) or to genomic intervals (e.g. genomic features such as exons or genes). two stand-alone applications developed with htseq are distributed with the package, namely htseq-qa for read quality assessment and htseq-count for preprocessing rna-seq alignments for differential expression calling. most of the features described in the following sections have been available since the initial release of the htseq package in 2010. since then, the package and especially the htseq-count script have found considerable use in the research community. the present article provides a description of the package and also reports on recent improvements. htseq comes with extensive documentation, including a tutorial that demonstrates the use of the core classes of htseq and discusses several important use cases in detail. the documentation, as well as htseqs design, is geared towards allowing users with only moderate python knowledge to create their own scripts, while shielding more advanced internals from the user.
