genome analysis multivariate welch t-test on distances motivation: permutational non-euclidean analysis of variance, permanova, is routinely used in exploratory analysis of multivariate datasets to draw conclusions about the significance of patterns visualized through dimension reduction. this method recognizes that pairwise distance matrix between observations is sufficient to compute within and between group sums of squares necessary to form the (pseudo) f statistic. moreover, not only euclidean, but arbitrary distances can be used. this method, however, suffers from loss of power and type i error inflation in the presence of heter-oscedasticity and sample size imbalances. results: we develop a solution in the form of a distance-based welch t-test, t 2 w , for two sample potentially unbalanced and heteroscedastic data. we demonstrate empirically the desirable type i error and power characteristics of the new test. we compare the performance of permanova and t 2 w in reanalysis of two existing microbiome datasets, where the methodology has originated. availability and implementation: the source code for methods and analysis of this article is available at https://github.com/alekseyenko/tw2. further guidance on application of these methods can be obtained from the author.the permanova test , has been proposed for use in numerical ecology to test for the location differences in microbial communities. the relationships between these communities are typically described by ecological distance metrics (e.g. jaccard, chisquared, bray-curtis) and visualized through dimension reduction (also referred to as ordination in numerical ecology literature). the permanova permutation test based on (pseudo) f statistic computed directly from distances is a widely accepted means of establishing statistical significance for observed patterns. this test and the extension of this paper are related to the multivariate behrensfisher problem of testing the difference in multivariate means of samples from several populations. the underlying statistics for both distance-based tests are related to the hotelling t 2 statistic. the permanova is more general in allowing for more than two populations to be compared simultaneously.the distance-based geometric approach; however, forgoes the need to estimate the covariance matrices. the cost of these geometric approaches is that they only provide omnibus tests, which are unable to make inferences about individual components of the multivariate random vectors tested. with the revived interest in numerical ecology fueled by the availability of dna sequencing-based high-throughput microbial community profiling, i.e. microbiomics, the permanova test is enjoying a new wave of popularity. several, cautionary articles have been published noting the undesired behavior of the test in heteroscedastic conditions . a definitive principled solution to this issue is still lacking, however. the consensus is to ascertain the presence of heteroscedasticity using an additional test (e.g. permdisp;) in case of positive permanova results and to report both with a disclaimer that the attribution of positive permanova test to location or dispersion differences cannot be made whenever both tests yield positive results. in reality, the exactly matching multivariate spread between factor levels can rarely be assumed and the robustness of permanova to violations of homoscedasticity has not been characterized empirically.by derivation t 2 w inherits the characteristics of the univariate unequal variance welch t-test. that test is recommended as a replacement for pooled variance t-test in all circumstances. testing for unequal variances by methods, such as permdisp, is not recommended before a choice of the primary test is made. the main disadvantage of the welchs t-test compared with anova is potential loss of robustness when violations of normality are present . this issue, however, rests on the limiting distributions of the tests. in our case, the inference is obtained by permutation testing, which alleviates this concern. thus t 2 w should also become a first line replacement for permanova in simple two-sample case. two-sample scenario is a common experimental design, but a general solution for k-level factors is still desirable. the behavior of permanova under heteroscedastic conditions with k-level factors have not been examined, but is suspected to suffer from similar shortcomings as in the two sample case. when heteroscedasticity is suspected, several remedial strategies can be implemented. first, a variance stabilizing transformation can be applied to the data to remove heteroscedasticity . if transformation of the data is not desirable for any reason, other strategies could include developing specialized sub-sampling and permutationbased strategies. for example, the data could be re-sampled m times at balanced sample sizes and an average permanova statisticthis statistic could then be compared with the null distribution generated by permuting the sample labels rtimes and computing the re-sampled f a 1;. .. ; f a r, wherethe significance can be determined by using regular permutation testing approach to compare the number of times the obtained statistic is more extreme than those observed under the null, i.e. p r p r j 1f a f a j. this method ensures that the groups are balanced in each comparison, but may still lead to loss of power due to decreased effective sample size in each sub-sampled comparison. this approach is reported here as a suggestion that needs further development and evaluation before in can be implemented in practice. the final strategy for analysis of data with arbitrary number of levels could involve the application of t 2 w to only relevant pairwise comparisons with appropriate multiple comparison controls in place.
