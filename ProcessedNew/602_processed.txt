genetics and population analysis automated design of paralogue ratio test assays for the accurate and rapid typing of copy number variation motivation: genomic copy number variation (cnv) can influence susceptibility to common diseases. high-throughput measurement of gene copy number on large numbers of samples is a challenging, yet critical, stage in confirming observations from sequencing or array comparative genome hybridization (cgh). the paralogue ratio test (prt) is a simple, cost-effective method of accurately determining copy number by quantifying the amplification ratio between a target and reference amplicon. prt has been successfully applied to several studies analyzing common cnv. however, its use has not been widespread because of difficulties in assay design. results: we present prtprimer (www.prtprimer.org) software for automated prt assay design. in addition to stand-alone software, the web site includes a database of pre-designed assays for the human genome at an average spacing of 6 kb and a web interface for custom assay design. other reference genomes can also be analyzed through local installation of the software. the usefulness of prtprimer was tested within known cnv, and showed reproducible quantification. this software and database provide assays that can rapidly genotype cnv, cost-effectively, on a large number of samples and will enable the widespread adoption of prt. availability: prtprimer is available in two forms: a perl script (version 5.14 and higher) that can be run from the command line on linux systems and as a service on the prtprimer web site (www.prtprimer.org).copy number variation (cnv) is a pervasive and extensive source of variation between individual genomes in humans and many other species. a genome-wide picture of cnv has been provided in humans by large consortia, typically using arraycomparative genomic hybridization . for example, a key analysis used an oligonucleotide tiling array to assay common cnv of 41 kb and found that two diploid human genomes typically differed in 41000 cnvs, covering a length of 24 mb (0.8 of the genome). for the 41 individuals studied from two populations taken together, 3.7 of the genome was shown to be copy number variable . in another study, itsara et al. studied large, rare cnv and showed that 6580 of individuals have a cnv of 4100 kb . pang et al. constructed a comprehensive map of cnv in a single genome and estimated structural variation to cover 48.8 mb, a region including 4867 genes . there is considerable evidence for cnv affecting phenotype, much of which comes from disease studies in humans. association analysis of common cnv with phenotypes is limited, in part, by the inherent noise in typing complex cnv with acgh technology or quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr). nevertheless, the wellcome trust case control consortium (wtccc) analyzed the genome-wide association between common cnv (56 had minor allele frequency 45) and reported five robust associations with complex diseases (even though they included only 4250 of cnv with a minor allele frequency 45) (the wellcome trust case). other well-founded associations include the effect of high b-defensin copy number on psoriasis , the effect of cyp2d6 copy number on drug metabolism and the role of a-globin copy number in a-thalassemia and protection against severe malaria . rare cnvs have also been shown to have major effects in human disease, particularly in neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and autism , although methodological issues have complicated interpretation. in drosophila melanogaster, the cyp6g1 gene copy number is associated with resistance to the insecticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane , and amplification of the pfmdr1 gene confers mefloquine resistance in plasmodium falciparum . in dogs, the diploid copy number of amy2b ranges between 4 and 30, and may be involved in the adaption to a starch-rich diet in early domestication . these both provide compelling evidence for a functional effect of cnv in other species. to maximize the power of association studies of cnv and phenotype, it is necessary to characterize cnv in terms of the actual integer number of copies per diploid genome (1, 2, 3, 4 etc.) in a cost-effective manner on large numbers of dna samples. genome-wide genotyping of cnv is possible by acgh, sequence read depth analysis of next-generation sequencing and analysis of hybridization signal intensity from snp genotyping arrays to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author(s) 2013. published by

integer copy number of complex multiallelic cnvs. a comprehensive comparison of array platforms and cnv detection software showed550 concordance between approaches and reproducibility of replicate experiments at 570 . for example, current sequence read depth analysis methods have high false discovery rates (51089), relatively low detection rates (3060) and are crucially dependent on the quality of read alignment to the reference genome . in addition, micrograms of dna are often required by these methods, with whole genome amplification not being viable, as current methods are known to introduce inconsistent copy number bias . there are three commonly used locus-specific methods that attempt to meet the challenge of accurate and efficient genotyping of cnv in large numbers of samples: multiplex ligation-dependent amplification, qpcr and the paralogue ratio test (prt). the multiplex ligation-dependent amplification method is used routinely in clinical genetics for screening disease genes for exons, and has been shown to accurately infer integer copy number even on challenging multicopy loci (eijk-van os and schouten, 2011). however, it is propriety, expensive and commercially available only for certain loci, and often 100200 ng of dna is required. qpcr is frequently used as a high-throughput method for cnv typing, particularly using fluorescent-quencher systems such as taqman. however, the method is susceptible to variation in dna quality and often gives apparently precise, but inaccurate, results at multicopy loci. this has been a bane of human cnv studies, leading to controversy in the field . prt is a form of quantitative pcr that differs from the conventional method in one important aspect: by careful design of the primers targeting paralogous sequences, one primer pair is used to amplify a putative cnv target locus relative to a single copy reference locus . this makes the kinetics of target and reference amplification similar, and results in increased accuracy of integer copy number calling. the target and reference amplicons can be separated by size using electrophoresis or by sequence using pyrosequencing, restriction enzyme digest or real-time pcr with sequence-specific fluorescent reporter probes. prt assays have been successfully applied in a number of human cnv studies . currently, prt assay design involves a laborious process of selecting either a self-chain segment (a short sequence that matches to more than one place in the genome, but is not a known repeat element) or a low copy number repeat within the target sequence. the selected sequence is then mapped to the reference genome using blat , and the sequence alignment of the target and paralogue(s) examined to identify two identically matched sequences long enough to allow primer design and flanking a stretch of dna either of different length or sequence. last, the putative primers are assessed using in silico pcr, to check that they produce only two amplicons of the predicted size, failing which the process will need to be repeated. this current design approach requires several hours for each assay and is dependent on self-chain or a low copy number repeat sequence in the target interval, which limits the number of assays that can be designed. in addition, there is some probability that an assay will not successfully transfer into the laboratory. these problems have prevented the widespread adoption of prt, despite its benefits over other technologies, but could be overcome by an automated approach to assay design. with this in mind, we have developed the software prtprimer and the web resource www.prtprimer.org. prtprimer is aimed at all users who would benefit from designing prt assays for the human genome. the software can be installed locally or run through the web resource, is optimized for multicore systems and can be adapted to use genomes from other species.in this article, we describe a resource of off-the-shelf prt assays as well as for custom design of assays. this resource, and prts in general, is conceived as an accessible method of validating and replicating cnv data generated by high-throughput approaches, such as array cgh, snp genotyping arrays or genome-scale sequencing. prt allows the accurate typing of copy number at individual genomic loci in hundreds of dna samples at a low cost. the simplest form of prt assays can be typed using pcr with unlabeled oligonucleotides and agarose gels, at a cost affordable by any laboratory. to increase throughput or reduce labor power, prt assays can be multiplexed using capillary electrophoresis or by qpcr. previously the utility of the prt had been limited by the difficulty of assay design. this has meant in practice that prt has been used by a limited number of laboratories with experience of the design issues. prtprimer overcomes this limitation by allowing users to either use the pre-designed assays, or if no suitable ones are found, to run the software to generate custom assays. this facility should open up the use of prt to a diverse range of laboratories that want type cnv in patient collections. the typical scenario we envisage is where array or sequencing data have identified a particular cnv as being possibly associated with a phenotype, and researchers want to type their own patient cohort for the same cnv without resorting to whole-genome analysis, whether because of affordability issues or lack of sufficient dna. large genomic laboratories may want to use prt as an easy method of replicating high-throughput data by an alternative method with accurate quantification of copy number. the software implementation of prtprimer involves a pipeline with genomic data passing through two well-established and publically available packages, primer3 and ispcr, followed by data sorting, filtering and output. the approach relies on bruteforce computation to design a high number of potential pcr products in a genomic region, align all of the primer pairs to the genome, using blat, to identify those that amplify exactly two products and then filter for those that have the desirable characteristics of a prt assay. this approach contrasts with the current method of using genome annotation to guide assay design, allowing a far greater number of assays to be designed over a wider proportion of the genome. assays in the pre-designed database are not randomly distributed but fall into clusters of overlapping amplicons. many of the amplicons within a cluster will vary by just a few base pairs at each end, and therefore do not represent truly different assays. however, other clusters will represent multiple assays that overlap. on a higher level the distribution of the clusters is also not random, with occasional gaps of 4100 kb, although the mean gap is 55 kb. of cnvs 410 kb, a high proportion is tagged by prt assays in the database; smaller cnvs are less likely to contain a pre-designed pr. for quantifying gene copy number the ideal prt assay will be between the first and last exons, a situation that exists for around half of genes, although 8090 of genes have an assay within 10 kb. for smaller cnvs and the remaining 1020 of genes, it may be possible to obtain assays using the software directly with altered parameters. despite the high density of assays and clusters across the genome, there remain intractable parts of the genome where assay design is not possible, presumably because of the lack of suitable repeat elements. for targets in these limited regions, an alternative technology such as conventional qpcr will be needed. it should be noted that although the assays produced by prtprimer are bioinformatically predicted to produce two distinguishable amplification products, they require laboratory validation before use. this resource is primarily focused on the human genome, but the underlying software can be easily adapted for other
