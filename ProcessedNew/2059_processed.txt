gimmemotifs: a de novo motif prediction pipeline for chip-sequencing experiments accurate prediction of transcription factor binding motifs that are enriched in a collection of sequences remains a computational challenge. here we report on gimmemotifs, a pipeline that incorporates an ensemble of computational tools to predict motifs de novo from chip-sequencing (chip-seq) data. similar redundant motifs are compared using the weighted information content (wic) similarity score and clustered using an iterative procedure. a comprehensive output report is generated with several different evaluation metrics to compare and evaluate the results. benchmarks show that the method performs well on human and mouse chip-seq datasets. gimmemotifs consists of a suite of command-line scripts that can be easily implemented in a chip-seq analysis pipeline. availability: gimmemotifs is implemented in python and runs on linux. the source code is freely available for download atthe spectacular development of sequencing technology has enabled rapid, cost-efficient profiling of dna binding proteins. chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput deep sequencing (chip-seq) delivers high-resolution binding profiles of transcription factors (tfs) . the elucidation of the binding characteristics of these tfs is one of the obvious follow-up questions. however, the de novo identification of dna sequence motifs remains a challenging computational task. although many methods have been developed with varying degrees of success, no single method consistently performs well on real biological eukaryotic data . the combination of different algorithmic approaches, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, has been shown to improve prediction accuracy and sensitivity over single methods . here, we report on gimmemotifs, a motif prediction pipeline using a ensemble of existing computational tools (supplementary). this pipeline has been specifically developed to predict tf motifs from chip-seq data. it uses the wealth of sequences (binding to whom correspondence should be addressed.peaks) usually resulting from chip-seq experiments to both predict motifs de novo, as well as validate these motifs in an independent fraction of the dataset. gimmemotifs incorporates the weighted information content (wic) similarity metric in an iterative clustering procedure to cluster similar motifs and reduce the redundancy which is the result of combining the output of different tools (see supplementary material). it produces an extensive graphical report with several evaluation metrics to enable interpretion of the results .we present gimmemotifs, a de novo motif prediction pipeline ideally suited to predict transcription factor binding motifs from chip-seq datasets. gimmemotifs clusters the results of several different tools and produces a comprehensive report to evaluate the predicted motifs. we show that gimmemotifs performs well on biologically relevant datasets of different tfs and compares favorably to other methods.
