gene expression cascade: a r package to study, predict and simulate the diffusion of a signal through a temporal gene network temporal gene interactions, in response to environmental stress, form a complex system that can be efficiently described using gene regulatory networks. they allow highlighting the more influential genes and spotting some targets for biological intervention experiments. despite that many reverse engineering tools have been designed, the cascade package is an integrated solution adding several new and original key features such as the ability to predict changes in gene expressions after a biological perturbation in the network and graphical outputs that allow monitoring the spread of a signal through the network. availability and implementation: the r package cascade is available online atsince the emergence of high-throughput technologies that allow measuring simultaneously expression of thousands of genes, many tools have been developed to learn gene expression profiles and reverse engineer their underlying gene regulatory network (grn) . these tools are either based on static coexpression methods or, if the biological phenomenon shows any temporality, time-dependent methods. although the former relies on the assumption that coexpressed genes share some biological characteristics, the latter infers a directed network with temporal dependencies. in this last case, another important distinction should be made between exogenous stress (e.g. growth response) and endogenous phenomenon (e.g. cell cycle) . this leads to different network topologies: in exogenous stress, networks topologies seem to have larger hubs and shorter paths through temporal-dependent transcriptional waves . this results in a quick response to environmental modifications . the cascade package is designed to model such cascade networks taking advantage of the assignment of genes to temporal clusters, which adds temporal causality in the network.
