data and text mining cobweb: a java applet for network exploration and visualisation cobweb is a java applet for real-time network visualization; its strength lies in enabling the interactive exploration of networks. therefore, it allows new nodes to be interactively added to a network by querying a database on a server. the network constantly rearranges to provide the most meaningful topological view. availability: cobweb is available under the gplv3 and may be freely downloaded atnetwork-based techniques are used today to tackle a wide variety of scientific questions, ranging from interaction mechanisms in protein networks to signalling pathway analysis . consequently, there is a strong need to have tools to visualize and explore networks such as cytoscape , gephi and proviz . however, these programs aim at visualizing large networks and offer many features. they cannot be integrated into web sites and have a significant learning curve. therefore, we have developed cobweb as a java applet that has fewer features but can be easily used from any webpage. cobweb offers uncomplicated real-time visualization of networks up to a few hundred nodes. in contrast to earlier web-based approaches such as medusa and jsquid , cobweb stresses interactive features. thus, it is possible to interactively add new nodes to the network at which time the network topology changes to provide the most uncluttered view.
