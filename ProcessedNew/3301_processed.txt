systems biology ntfdâ€”a stand-alone application for the non-targeted detection of stable isotope-labeled compounds in gc/ms data most current stable isotope-based methodologies are targeted and focus only on the well-described aspects of metabolic networks. here, we present ntfd (non-targeted tracer fate detection), a software for the non-targeted analysis of all detectable compounds derived from a stable isotope-labeled tracer present in a gc/ms data-set. in contrast to traditional metabolic flux analysis approaches, ntfd does not depend on any a priori knowledge or library information. to obtain dynamic information on metabolic pathway activity, ntfd determines mass isotopomer distributions for all detected and labeled compounds. these data provide information on relative fluxes in a metabolic network. the graphical user interface allows users to import gc/ms data in netcdf format and export all information into a tab-separated format. availability: ntfd is c-and qt4-based, and it is freely available under an open-source license. pre-compiled packages for the installation on debian-and redhat-based linux distributions, as well as windows operating systems, along with example data, are provided for download at http://ntfd.mit.edu/.with the advent of systems biology, scientists now have the ability to probe and quantify the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of virtually any organism (including uniformly or singly labeled carbon, nitrogen, or sulfur tracers. in the case of deuterium, care must be taken, as the deuterium effect may cause labeled and unlabeled compounds to elute at different retention times from the gc . to reduce experimental noise, both experiments should be performed simultaneously and in replicates, which also enables ntfd to provide confidence intervals for each mass isotopomer. ntfd accepts mass spectrometric data in the common netcdf format, which is supported by nearly all current gc/ms instruments as an export function.
