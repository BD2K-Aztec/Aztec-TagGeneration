structural bioinformatics metalionrna: computational predictor of metal-binding sites in rna structures motivation: metal ions are essential for the folding of rna molecules into stable tertiary structures and are often involved in the catalytic activity of ribozymes. however, the positions of metal ions in rna 3d structures are difficult to determine experimentally. this motivated us to develop a computational predictor of metal ion sites for rna structures. results: we developed a statistical potential for predicting positions of metal ions (magnesium, sodium and potassium), based on the analysis of binding sites in experimentally solved rna structures. the metalionrna program is available as a web server that predicts metal ions for rna structures submitted by the user. availability: the metalionrna web server is accessible atrna plays a key role in many biological processes. it takes part in almost every aspect of processing genetic information, including decoding codon triplets, alternative splicing, peptide bond formation and the regulation of these mechanisms . the function of many rna molecules is dependent on their 3d structure . the rna backbone is negatively charged. the neutralization of the electrostatic repulsion by the binding of cations is essential for the formation of compact tertiary structures. it has been shown in folding studies that trna stability increases remarkably in the presence of monovalent (especially na + and k + ) and divalent (mg 2+ ) cations . however, divalent mg 2+ cations are more effective in stabilizing the native structure of rna . the higher the charge density of the rna, the higher the concentration of cations near the surface and the greater the entropic advantage in using divalent ones, because fewer cations are confined near to whom correspondence should be addressed. the rna. thus, a small number of strong mg 2+ binding sites maybe responsible for the effective stabilization of rna tertiary structure [reviewed by (. metal ions also serve as essential cofactors in many reactions catalyzed by ribozymes. the hammerhead ribozyme, group i and group ii introns, as well as ribonuclease p (rnasep) ribozymes are examples of catalytic rna that need divalent cations to perform their functions [reviewed by (. for example, the cleavage of a phosphodiester bond by the hammerhead ribozyme depends on the presence of metal ions that are required for both folding and activity . the formation of rnametal ion complexes occurs in an aqueous environment. the energy of electrostatic interactions of a cation with water molecules depends on its charge and radius. mg 2+ has a small radius (0.72 ) and can tightly organize six water molecules in an octahedral arrangement, followed by organization of further layers of water. theoretical calculations combined with experimental analyses suggest a total hydration-free energy for mg 2+ of 455 kcal/mol . k + is larger (radius 1.38 ), has a smaller charge and it organizes eight or nine water molecules in a less ordered manner, with the hydration energy of 80 kcal/mol . three different binding modes of magnesium ions can be distinguished. first, partially dehydrated cations can interact with rna directly, chelated by electronegative atoms, such as phosphate oxygens, creating very strong interactions. second, fully solvated cations can be stably bound to rna via one or two layers of water molecules. third, cations may contribute to rna stability without occupying discrete sites, in a diffuse manner, where they interact with the rna only by electrostatic interactions, without making direct contacts or perturbing their hydration layers. despite the growing number of experimentally solved rna structures, the positions of cations in these structures still cannot be easily determined. mg 2+ , na + and h 2 o have 10 electrons each and can be distinguished only in high-resolution crystal structures. hence, many bound cations can be easily mistaken for water molecules or may be missing from crystal structures. the positions of metal ions are also difficult to determine by nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr). this situation motivated us to develop a computational predictor which only uses information about the rna structure to identify the most likely metal ion-binding sites in this structure.we developed metalionrna, a computational method for the prediction of metal ion-binding sites in rna 3d structures, using a statistical potential and a grid-based calculation approach. the potential is based on the analysis of known metal ion-binding sites present in 113 rna structures. as an input, metalionrna takes an rna 3d structure in the pdb format, and returns pdb files with the calculated rna potential surface and the coordinates of cations predicted for the target rnastructure.metalionrna is a novel tool for predicting metal ion-binding sites in rna structures. it uses an anisotropic statistical potential trained on a database of known structures. the current implementation is capable of making predictions for mg 2+ , na + and k + cations, and further ions will be added as the database of rna structures is expected to grow. the 5-fold cross-validation test proved that ion positions are predicted by metalionrna with useful accuracy, as the method successfully reproduces the crystallographically determined positions of mg 2+ , na + and k + cations in dozens of different rna molecules. a similar accuracy was achieved by the prediction of mg 2+ in dna structures, which were not used for training, revealing that the general mechanism of ion binding by both types of the nucleic acids is sufficiently similar to be captured by a coarse-grained method such as ours. comparison with another fully automated method feature demonstrated that metalionrna can identify true mg 2+ sites in rna structure with a relatively low rate of false positives, suggesting that it may be a practically useful tool. there are alternative approaches for predicting metal ion-binding sites in rna structures with high accuracy. hermann and westhof (1998) applied brownian dynamics (bd) simulations of cations diffusing under the influence of random brownian motion within the electrostatic field to predict metal ion-binding sites. misra andpresented an analytical model based on the non-linear poissonboltzmann (pb) equation that describes the energetic and stoichiometric linkage between the mg 2+ binding and rna folding.) developed a statistical mechanical model based on the pb theory, which considers and ensemble of discrete ion distributions; it models electrostatics and steric interactions for tightly bound ions and uses the mean-field fluid model to describe the diffuse ions. the advantage of these methods is that they model the physicochemistry of the system and therefore can be used to infer dynamic and thermodynamic parameters of the systems under study and its individual elements. an important feature of these and similar methods is the examination of the system under physical conditions defined by the user, such as temperature, concentration of different ions, possible presence of other molecules, etc. these methods are, however, computationally very costly, and require specialized expertise to set up and run the simulations, and to interpret their results. the simulation methods are not available as black box packages that can take an rna structure as an input and generate defined positions of ions as an output. for these reasons, they cannot be used to make predictions for a large series of test structures. they serve different purpose than the automated predictive methods such as feature or metalionrna and these two types of tools cannot be directly compared. the advantage of metalionrna is that it is relatively fast, can be accessed by a user friendly web interface and does not require special skills to interpret the results. ion sites predicted by metalionrna are ranked according to their score, which can be used to infer the relative order and strength of binding consecutive metal ions by the given rna molecule e.g. with increasing ion concentration. metalionrna requires the 3d structure of a nucleic acid as an input. however, predictions of ion-binding sites in nucleic acid structures may be validated experimentally with methods that do not require the experimental determination of nucleic acid structure. in particular, fenton chemistry makes use of the ability of fe 2+ to replace mg 2+ and to generate highly reactive hydroxyl radicals that can cleave nucleic acid backbones in spatial proximity of the ion-binding site; the sites of cleavage can be then mapped with standard biochemical methods . this and other methods of experimental determination of ion-binding sites can be used in conjunction with metalionrna to model rna structures in the more physically and biologically realistic ion-bound state. the next steps in the development of metalionrna will be to assess its ability to predict ion-binding sites in low-accuracy structures and to explore the possibilities of integrating the modeling of metal ions with software for automated rna 3d structure modeling by comparative or de novo assembly approaches . we also intend to explore the possibility to include the ion concentration as a parameter of the prediction, and to enable predictions for mixed solutions with different cations present simultaneously and potentially competing for similar binding sites.
