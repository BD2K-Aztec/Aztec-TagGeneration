databases and ontologies ontoquery: easy-to-use web-based owl querying the web ontology language (owl) provides a sophisticated language for building complex domain ontologies and is widely used in bio-ontologies such as the gene ontology. the prot g-owl ontology editing tool provides a query facility that allows composition and execution of queries with the human-readable manchester owl syntax, with syntax checking and entity label lookup. no equivalent query facility such as the prot g description logics (dl) query yet exists in web form. however, many users interact with bio-ontologies such as chemical entities of biological interest and the gene ontology using their online web sites, within which dl-based querying function-ality is not available. to address this gap, we introduce the ontoquery web-based query utility. availability and implementation: the source code for this implementation together with instructions for installation is available at http://github.com/ilincatudose/ontoquery. ontoquery software is fully compatible with all owl-based ontologies and is available for download (cc-0 license). the chebi installation, chebi ontoquery, is available at
