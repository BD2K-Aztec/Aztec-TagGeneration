genetics and population analysis metabomxtr: an r package for mixture-model analysis of non-targeted metabolomics data non-targeted metabolomics technologies often yield data in which abundance for any given metabolite is observed and quantified for some samples and reported as missing for other samples. apparent missingness can be due to true absence of the metabolite in the sample or presence at a level below detectability. mixture-model analysis can formally account for metabolite missingness due to absence or undetectability, but software for this type of analysis in the high-throughput setting is limited. the r package metabomxtr has been developed to facilitate mixture-model analysis of non-targeted metabolomics data in which only a portion of samples have quantifi-able abundance for certain metabolites.high-throughput metabolomics profiling has surged in popularity with non-targeted technologies in particular offering opportunity for discovery of new metabolite associations with phenotypes or outcomes. a challenge to analyzing non-targeted output is the frequent occurrence of missing data . these data are not missing in the sense that they were not collected; rather, metabolites may be detected and their abundance quantified in some samples and not others. typically conducted using nuclear magnetic resonance, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry or gas chromatographymass spectrometry , non-targeted assays typically have unknown lower detection thresholds. thus, when a given metabolite is not detected, it is unknown whether that metabolite was indeed absent or merely undetectable. several approaches for handling missingness have been described in metabolomics literature, including complete case analysis, imputation and adaptations of classic dimension reduction tools to allow for missing data. for metabolite-by-metabolite analyses, imputation is common, with methods including minimum, median and nearest neighbor imputation . partial least squares discriminant analysis and principal components analysis with missing data adaptations have been used, although these methods identify regression-based linear combinations of multiple correlated metabolites associated with a phenotype or outcome, and, in general, results are less translatable for understanding individual metabolite contributions (;). an underused approach for metabolite-by-metabolite analysis is the bernoulli/lognormal mixture model proposed by. this method simultaneously estimates parameters modeling the probability of non-missing response and the mean of observed values. imputation is not required, and instead missingness is explicitly modeled as either true absence or presence below detectability, consistent with non-targeted metabolomics technology. we used mixture models to analyze gc-ms metabolomics data , but, to our knowledge, there is no available software to easily perform these analyses that folds into existing high-throughput data analysis pipelines. noting the elegance of the mixture-model approach and the continued issue of missing data in metabolomics research, we present metabomxtr, an r package that automates mixturemodel analysis. the core functions accept r objects typically handled in bioconductor-type analyses or basic data frames, thus providing a flexible tool to complement existing user pipelines and preferences for data preprocessing.this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution non-commercial license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), which permits non-commercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. for commercial re-use, please contact journals.permissions@oup.com (generally following log transformation), the contribution of the ith observation to the likelihood is:the r package metabomxtr facilitates mixture-model analysis of non-targeted metabolomics data. re-analysis of the hapo pilot metabolomics data indicates that mixture-model analysis detects metabolites identified by other common imputation approaches and additionally identifies associations that would otherwise be missed. rigorous testing of mixture models on a wider scale is warranted. in summary, metabomxtr provides metabolomics researchers a previously unavailable tool for handling non-targeted metabolomics missingness.
