essamem: finding maximal exact matches using enhanced sparse suffix arrays we have developed essamem, a tool for finding maximal exact matches that can be used in genome comparison and read mapping. essamem enhances an existing sparse suffix array implementation with a sparse child array. tests indicate that the enhanced algorithm for finding maximal exact matches is much faster, while maintaining the same memory footprint. in this way, sparse suffix arrays remain competitive with the more complex compressed suffix arrays. availability: source code is freely available at https://github.ugent.be/ computationalbiology/essamem.maximal exact matches (mems) are exact matches between two sequences that cannot be extended to the left or right without introducing a mismatch. in addition, extra cardinality constraints can be imposed, leading to the concepts of maximal unique matches (mums) and maximal almost-unique matches. these matches are widely used as seeds for sequence comparisons and alignment tools, such as mummer . algorithms for memory-efficient mem-finding can be divided into online and indexed methods. algorithms of the former type construct a (compressed) index structure for the concatenation of both sequences and iterate over the index to find the mems or mums . essamem belongs to the class of indexed mem-finding algorithms, which match one sequence against an index of the other sequence. the advantage of indexed mem-finding over online mem-finding algorithms is the reusability of the constructed index. originally, suffix trees or enhanced suffix arrays (esa) were used to find mems. however, the size of these types of indexes is several times larger than the size of the indexed sequence. esas consist of four arrays [suffix, longest common prefix (lcp), child and suffix link arrays] that contain parts of the information stored in suffix trees and together reach the full expressiveness of suffix trees . several algorithms build on the idea of esas by using more memory-efficient variants of the arrays.suggest the use of sparse suffix arrays (ssa). ssas index only every kth suffix of the sequence. the parameter k is called the sparseness factor. their ssa-based algorithm, sparsemem, is able to find mems faster than previous methods, while using less memory. as a result of this lower memory footprint, ssas can also index larger genomes than previous methods. however, for large values of k, the execution time increases dramatically. more recently, an algorithm using (enhanced) compressed suffix arrays (csa) was presented by. in contrast to ssas, these compressed counterparts index every kth suffix array value. it was shown how the csa-based mem-finding algorithm, backwardmem, outperforms sparsemem, except when memory is abundant. in this article, we optimize the method by khan et al. by supplementing ssas with a sparse child array for large sparseness factors. we show that the new index structure outperforms the previous design, while maintaining the same memory footprint. furthermore, when combining both the suffix link and child arrays, we achieve a complete enhanced sparse suffix array (essa), which has the same expressiveness as suffix trees for substrings larger than k. we show that essas are competitive for mem-finding with the csa-based method by ohlebusch et al. and outperform commonly used methods like mummer and vmatch (http://www.vmatch.de/). this indicates that, although compressed index structures have recently become popular , the use of essa-based algorithms can be a viable option for further research.essamem is open source and can be used as drop-in replacement for tools that require mem-finding. in particular, essamem supports all mummer v3.23 options. we evaluated the performance of essamem against sparsemem, mummer, vmatch and backwardmem using all relevant datasets provided previously . the default setting of essamem features a sparse child array and an estimate for the optimized skip parameter, but lacks suffix links support. because the sparse child array has the same size as the inverse suffix array (only required for suffix link support), essamem has the same memory footprint as the index structure used by khan et al. for optimizing s, the runtime for a maximum of five successive values of s is taken. the largest value of s is set to be the largest value for which l s k 1 ! 10. timing results do not include the index construction phase, and the resident set size was measured to determine the memory footprint of the programs. the program parameters are the same as used in the study conducted by. however, we explore a much larger interval of sparseness and compression factors than previously reported by other authors. all mem-finding algorithms are tested on six pairs of megabase-sized genomes and two sequencing read datasets. sparsemem and essamem are also tested on two pairs of gigabase-sized sequences.depicts the memory-time trade-offs presented by the different algorithms for finding all mems between drosophila melanogaster and drosophila yakuba. the other results, which can be found in the supplementary material, depict a similar behaviour. mummer and vmatch have one of the lowest mapping times among the tested programs. their memory requirements are, however, higher than those of the tools using compressed or sparse index structures. furthermore, they do not allow setting a memory-time trade-off. the tests show that sparsemem is clearly outperformed by essamem and backwardmem. although sparsemem is fast for small values of k, its performance steeply decreases when k is increased, which can be explained by the diminishing use of suffix links. for the largest values of k, a decrease in the runtime of the mapping phase has a positive effect on the overall runtime of sparsemem. a similar decrease in runtime for the mapping phase can be observed using the sparse child array in essamem. this is, however, countered by the diminishing effect of the skip parameter and can, therefore, not be seen in. the lower running time for the mapping phase might be explained by a combination of the use of a sparse child array that can match more than one character at the same time, smaller minimum lengths in the matching phase and improved i/o performance. when s is increased, the runtime decreases manifold. this effect is, however, limited by the theoretical bound s k l. the effects of the various improvements made to the original ssa-based design are discussed in the supplementary material. the results also indicate that essamem is in general somewhat faster than backwardmem for comparable memory settings. the difference in runtime is larger when either memory is abundant (low values of k), or the number of mems found is large, as backwardmem seems to have a stronger dependency on the output size. this behaviour can be seen in, where the runtime of backwardmem steeply increases for k48. in contrast to ssa-based methods, however, backwardmem puts no restriction on the maximum value of k and could thus be used for small l settings in combination with a high compression factor. in terms of memory consumption, backwardmem starts with a lower memory footprint at no compression, but the memory footprint of essamem decreases faster. theoretically, the csa. scatterplot showing the memory-time trade-offs for finding all mems of minimum length 50 between d.melanogaster (169 mb) and d.yakuba (166 mb). the data points are acquired by setting the sparseness/compression factor k to the following values (from right to left): 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32. there is only one data point for mummer and vmatch index requires 4=k 1:375 bytes per input character, and the essa index requires 9=k 1 bytes per input character. as a result, both indexes theoretically have the same memory requirements for k 13. the actual allocated memory for the sparse or compressed index structures for the d.melanogaster genome is given in. for this dataset, the index size of the mem-finding tools is equal for k between 4 and 8.
