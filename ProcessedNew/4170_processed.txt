databases and ontologies seeqtl: a searchable database for human eqtls seeqtl is a comprehensive and versatile eqtl database, including various eqtl studies and a meta-analysis of hapmap eqtl information. the database presents eqtl association results in a convenient browser, using both segmented local-association plots and genome-wide manhattan plots. availability and implementation: seeqtl is freely available for non-commercial use atthe association of rna expression traits with dna variation, including from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) and copynumber variants (cnvs), has been a subject of active inquiry in recent years, shedding light on fundamental biological processes underlying transcription. here we use the generic term expression quantitative trait loci (eqtls) to describe these dna variants and their associated expression traits . a large number of studies have been published on hapmap lymphoblastoid cell lines and other human tissues, covering several continental-level populations . in addition to the general importance of dissecting transcriptional regulation, eqtl analysis may also provide a window into the mechanisms underlying transcription-mediated disease . several online databases are available which report eqtl associations based on published datasets. scan is a large-scale database of genetic and genomic data, which allows users to search for eqtls by querying multiple genes or snps/cnvs, but is not designed primarily as an eqtl database. the eqtl browser is based on the gbrowse platform and displays results from multiple studies and allows navigation throughout the genome. the gtex (genotype-tissue expression) eqtl database will be populated by tissue-specific eqtl information as the gtex project
