data and text mining meltdb 2.0â€“advances of the metabolomics software system motivation: the research area metabolomics achieved tremendous popularity and development in the last couple of years. owing to its unique interdisciplinarity, it requires to combine knowledge from various scientific disciplines. advances in the high-throughput technology and the consequently growing quality and quantity of data put new demands on applied analytical and computational methods. exploration of finally generated and analyzed datasets furthermore relies on powerful tools for data mining and visualization. results: to cover and keep up with these requirements, we have created meltdb 2.0, a next-generation web application addressing storage, sharing, standardization, integration and analysis of metabo-lomics experiments. new features improve both efficiency and effect-ivity of the entire processing pipeline of chromatographic raw data from pre-processing to the derivation of new biological knowledge. first, the generation of high-quality metabolic datasets has been vastly simplified. second, the new statistics tool box allows to investigate these datasets according to a wide spectrum of scientific and explorative questions. availability: the system is publicly available at https://meltdb.cebitec. uni-bielefeld.de. a login is required but freely available.metabolomics research covers all aspects of the investigation of small molecule metabolite compositions resulting from cellular processes and constitutes an integrated part of systems biology . like transcriptomics and proteomics, metabolomics is capable of measuring extrinsically initiated changes in organisms. the metabolome, the entity of all small molecules in a cell, organism or tissue, is considered to be the closest to the phenotype of all -omes . compared with other molecular levels or-omics methods, metabolomics is challenging in its high degree of interdisciplinarity, interlinking experts from research fields as diverse as engineering, physics, chemistry and biology and from cheminformatics over bioinformatics to statistics, data mining and finally visualization.both sample acquisition and subsequent analysis are automated in high-throughput instruments, which has continuously posed challenges on the systematic storage and computational processing of the gathered experimental datasets, starting in the early 2000s. the increasing number and quality of measurements not only raised the generated data volume but also allowed to address more complex biological questions within conducted experiments. to comprehensively address these demands, bioinformatics internet applications were developed. meltdb, a software platform for the analysis and integration of data from metabolomics experiments, has been published byreleased metaboanalyst, a comprehensive tool suite for metabolomic data analysis.published the metabolomeexpress web server as a public place to process, interpret and share gc/ms metabolomics datasets. since around 2008, we have observed that the requirements to comprehensive metabolomics software platforms have changed: the general growth of the field of metabolomics and the increasing number of collaborations diversified the user community of researchers and their individual scientific goals. it is obvious that the success of a metabolomics study depends on an efficient and effective collaboration of this interdisciplinary research community. thus, not only the availability and sharing of the data is important but also special functions have to be significantly extended with specific features to consider all researchers demands and perspectives. in addition, the ever-increasing throughput and the constant lack of time makes it immensely important that automated pre-processing methods are reliable and that analyses and manual intervention are fast and easy. since metabolomics approaches are applied to more and more scientific objectives, a powerful set of statistical methods is mandatory, ranging from hypothesis-driven statistical tests to less specified and untargeted data-mining methods, such as clustering and dimension reduction. finally, the wealth of generated data poses a necessity for exploratory data analysis tools and information visualization. to tackle these new challenges systematically, a next generation of bioinformatics tools needed to be developed, covering all of the aforementioned aspects of metabolome data analysis, ranging from processing raw data (rd) to finishing and finally the derivation of biological knowledge. during the stages of that process, one can identify four successive data categories that represent different levels of data classification and annotation as well as different levels of abstraction. first, rd, stored and organized in meaningful groups, build the basis. then, pre-processed data (pd) is computed, where peaks and their to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2013. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution

are consistently annotated over chromatograms of an experiment and thus become comparable. last, derivative data (dd) is achieved by statistical analyses of metabolite quantities in an experiment and then visualized to allow effective exploration and to draw conclusions. in this manuscript, we present meltdb 2.0, which offers novel tools to challenge the rising wealth of data quality and quantity and support the analysis of all four categories rd, pd, id and dd and includes a multitude of updates. new and improved preprocessing methods underpin the reliability of automatically created annotations. at the same time, straightforward tools for manual peak annotation simplify the curation even of large experiments. to help answering questions of different scientific objectives, the set of statistical analyses and data-mining tools has been strongly enriched. to finally nail down the quintessence of an experiments outcome, data exploration is supported by new interactive and telling information visualizations.
