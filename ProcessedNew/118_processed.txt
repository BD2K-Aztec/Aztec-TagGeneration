structural bioinformatics addendum: topology and prediction of rna pseudoknots it has come to our attention that several concepts and results underlying the gfold software presented in our article topology and prediction of rna pseudoknots (reidys et al., 2011) are also present in earlier work by bon et al. (2008); orland and zee (2002); pillsbury et al. (2005b); vernizzi et al. (2005) and (pillsbury et al., 2005a). here, we briefly examine these works in relation to the results of our paper. the classification and expansion of pseudoknotted rna structures in terms of the topological genus of an associated fatgraph or double line graph were first proposed by orland and zee (2002) and bon et al. (2008), although fatgraphs were applied to rna secondary structures already by penner and waterman (1993) and penner (2004). the enumerative results initiated by orland and zee (2002) are based on matrix models, while our generating functions are derived via representation theory (zagier, 1995). enumeration results on rna structures according to genus were already obtained by vernizzi et al. (2005), again using the formal framework of the matrix model. genus as well as other topological invariants of fatgraphs were introduced and studied as descriptors of proteins in penner et al. (2010). pillsbury et al. (2005a) report recursion relations of time complexity o(n 6) to generate rna structures of genus one in the context of an rna folding algorithm that is substantially different from our algorithm gfold. aside from not incorporating loop-based energy models, gfold is not restricted to genus one rna structures. the four basic irreducible shadows of genus one in theorem 2.3 of our paper appeared first in bon et al. (2008); pillsbury et al. (2005b). the shadows of reidys et al. (2011) are derived from (i) the notion of irreducibility formulated by kleitman (1970) and (ii) the work on pseudoknot shapes by jin and reidys (2009); reidys and wang (2010). irreducibility is equivalent to the concept of primitivity introduced by bon et al. (2008), inspired by the work of dyson (1949). the equation to compute the genus of a fatgraph is classical going back to euler (1752) and was first applied in the context representing rna structures by orland and zee (2002) and bon et al. (2008).
