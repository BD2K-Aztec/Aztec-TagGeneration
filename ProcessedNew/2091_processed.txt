goldilocks: a tool for identifying genomic regions that are 'just right' we present goldilocks: a python package providing functionality for collecting summary statistics, identifying shifts in variation, discovering outlier regions and locating and extracting interesting regions from one or more arbitrary genomes for further analysis, for a user-provided definition of interesting. availability and implementation: goldilocks is freely available open-source software distributed under the mit licence. source code is hosted publicly at https://github.com/samstudio8/goldilocks and the package may also be installed using pip install goldilocks. documentation can be found atgoldilocks is a python package designed to take a census of sequence data in order to find regions that meet some criteria that are just right for further analysis. it can be used by importing the package into a standalone script or via the command line tool. the tool accepts sequence data which could be from one or more individuals (with one or more sequences from each), organized into chromosomes or contigs and stored as fasta. goldilocks must also be supplied with a desired census strategy defining the criteria of interest, such as occurrences of individual nucleotide bases, motifs, deviations from a reference or gc-content. chromosomes (or contigs) are slid beneath a window of a user-defined length and overlap and the strategy is applied over all input genomes. goldilocks was developed as part of a quality control study to first determine what constitutes bad quality data. for a large study, a pipeline was constructed to repeatedly perform variant calling, withholding one sample from the analysis in turn. a given samples downstream effect could then be quantified by measuring the difference in the accuracy of a run in the absence of that sample. however, repeated application of computationally expensive and time consuming analysis of whole genomes was unsustainable.the problem space needed to be reduced to a representative region: the genomes goldilocks. for our study, we defined a 1 mb region as just right if it contained within 610 percentiles of the median number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) appearing over all regions of our genome wide association study. these regions were then sorted by the number of snps appearing within the corresponding regions in a separate genotyping chip study. this allowed us to maximize the number of sites at which to check consensus between a run of our quality control pipeline and the snp chip. goldilocks was originally designed to return regions that matched these explicit criteria across multiple samples. the package has since been made more flexible and can be used to find regions of interest based on any arbitrary criteria such as gc-content, density of target motifs, pre-defined metrics and uncalled nucleotides (ns).thealternative counting mechanisms, such as those available in galaxy through emboss or various statistics tools in the galaxy toolshed, can accomplish similar functionality. however, as different tools require specific input formats and produce a variety of output formats, additional data handling steps are required as part of any pipeline, making it difficult to customize or swap counting plugins. goldilocks is not intended to replace already existing dedicated software for counting tasks that require specific optimized data structures such as khmer for counting k-mers, but instead provides a general suite of swappable counters. genome browsers such as the ucsc genome browser allow the user to view a variety of tracks displaying the locations of different genomic properties. interpreting large amounts of sequencing data by eye in such browsers can be difficult. alternative browsers that allow zoomed browsing of interesting regions, such as the layercake visualization tool, attempt to ameliorate this problem. goldilocks will automatically find regions of interest, suitable for further browsing or plotting if required. epiviz and epivizr combine both statistical analysis and visualization, connecting a web-based browsing environment to an r/bioconductor-based calculation environment. users interactively add more tracks or plots to further explore the areas surrounding the regions of interest in the genome. their platform is comprehensive and provides a far larger scope for analysis than goldilocks. we see goldilocks as a lightweight python solution for straightforward queries, and a useful addition to existing bioinformatics pipelines. goldilocks has minimal dependencies: the core requires just numpy and matplotlib to enable plotting. we provide a command line tool that offers access to the base functionality of the package to users without having to write a script of their own (for example usage see the supplement). goldilocks is packaged with a testing suite, results and coverage of which are available online along with documentation. source code is publicly available under an open source licence for review and community contribution.
