databases and ontologies tools4mirs â€“ one place to gather all the tools for mirna analysis mirnas are short, non-coding molecules that negatively regulate gene expression and thereby play several important roles in living organisms. dozens of computational methods for mirna-related research have been developed, which greatly differ in various aspects. the substantial availability of difficult-to-compare approaches makes it challenging for the user to select a proper tool and prompts the need for a solution that will collect and categorize all the methods. here, we present tools4mirs, the first platform that gathers currently more than 160 methods for broadly defined mirna analysis. the collected tools are classified into several general and more detailed categories in which the users can additionally filter the available methods according to their specific research needs, capabilities and preferences. tools4mirs is also a web-based target prediction meta-server that incorporates user-designated target prediction methods into the analysis of user-provided data.micrornas (mirnas) are a class of short (1824 nt), non-coding and single-stranded rnas that mediate the post-transcriptional gene expression regulation by promoting the cleavage or inhibiting the translation of the target mrna . throughout their mechanism, mirnas control the cell development, apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation and several other essential functions in living organisms (to address this need, tools4mirs, a user-friendly, manually curated and filterable service that gathers methods for mirna analyses, was developed. in mirna-related research, considerable importance is attached to mirna target identification, which reflects the function of the mirna in the cell. therefore, tools4mirs also enables the prediction of mirna targets using methods previously selected by the user.
