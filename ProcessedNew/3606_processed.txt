popdrowser: the population drosophila browser motivation: the completion of 168 genome sequences from a single population of drosophila melanogaster provides a global view of genomic variation and an understanding of the evolutionary forces shaping the patterns of dna polymorphism and divergence along the genome. results: we present the population drosophila browser (popdrowser), a new genome browser specially designed for the automatic analysis and representation of genetic variation across the d. melanogaster genome sequence. popdrowser allows estimating and visualizing the values of a number of dna polymorphism and divergence summary statistics, linkage disequilibrium parameters and several neutrality tests. popdrowser also allows performing custom analyses on-the-fly using user-selected parameters. availability: popdrowser is freely available from http://popdrowser .population genetics studies have been so far based on fragmentary and non-random samples of genomes, providing a partial and often biased view of the population genetics processes . a new dimension to genetic variation studies is provided by the new availability of within-species genomes. nextgeneration sequencing technologies are making affordable genomewide population genetics data, not only for humans and the main model organisms, but also for most organisms on which research is actively carried out on genetics, ecology or evolution . genome browsers are very useful tools to query and visualize disparate annotations at different genomic locations using a web user interface . a number of web-based genome browsers displaying genetic variation data are already available . such browsers, however, are not well suited to deal with population genomics sequence information. for example, hapmap , the most comprehensive
