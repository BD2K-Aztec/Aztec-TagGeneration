survcurv database and online survival analysis platform update understanding the biology of ageing is an important and complex challenge. survival experiments are one of the primary approaches for measuring changes in ageing. here, we present a major update to survcurv, a database and online resource for survival data in animals. as well as a substantial increase in data and additions to existing graphical and statistical survival analysis features, survcurv now includes extended mathematical mortality modelling functions and survival density plots for more advanced representation of groups of survival cohorts. availability and implementation: the database is freely available at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/survcurv/. all data are published under the creative commons attribution license.the biological phenomenon of ageing has been a long standing area of research . despite identification of many gene knock-outs, drug administration and environmental regimes that can extend lifespan of model organisms under laboratory conditions, many questions remain unresolved . a key experimental approach in research on ageing is to use longevity survival experiments, which usually characterize differences with respect to ageing between populations when other causes of death, such as predators, food competition and pathogens, are excluded. until recently, numerical data from animal survival experiments were usually not shared, and the data were analysed only in the original study, hampering method development, re-analysis of existing data by new methods, meta-analyses combining data and systems biology approaches. we have created the survcurv database and online analysis platform for animal survival data . here, we present a major survcurv update, comprising improvements and new analysis features as well as increased data content.
