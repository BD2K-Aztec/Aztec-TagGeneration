data and text mining wave-spec: a preprocessing package for mass spectrometry data wave-spec is a pre-processing package for mass spectrometry (ms) data. the package includes several novel algorithms that overcome conventional difficulties with the pre-processing of such data. in this application note, we demonstrate step-by-step use of this package on a real-world maldi dataset. availability: the package can be downloaded at http://www.vicc.org/biostatistics/supp.php. a shared mailbox (wave-spec@vanderbilt.edu) also is available for questions regarding application of the package.this paper demonstrates how the wave-spec package works, as an application note designed to complement a wave-spec method paper published previously . the rest of this paper is organized as a step-by-step demonstration on real maldi-tof data and follows the procedure presented in supplementary.
