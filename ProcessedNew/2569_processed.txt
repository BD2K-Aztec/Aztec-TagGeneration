gene expression iqrray, a new method for affymetrix microarray quality control, and the homologous organ conservation score, a new benchmark method for quality control metrics motivation: microarray results accumulated in public repositories are widely reused in meta-analytical studies and secondary databases. the quality of the data obtained with this technology varies from experiment to experiment, and an efficient method for quality assessment is necessary to ensure their reliability. results: the lack of a good benchmark has hampered evaluation of existing methods for quality control. in this study, we propose a new independent quality metric that is based on evolutionary conservation of expression profiles. we show, using 11 large organ-specific data-sets, that iqrray, a new quality metrics developed by us, exhibits the highest correlation with this reference metric, among 14 metrics tested. iqrray outperforms other methods in identification of poor quality arrays in datasets composed of arrays from many independent experiments. in contrast, the performance of methods designed for detecting outliers in a single experiment like normalized unscaled standard error and relative log expression was low because of the inability of these methods to detect datasets containing only low-quality arrays and because the scores cannot be directly compared between experiments.thousands of microarray results are available in public repositories such as the gene expression omnibus and arrayexpress . this wealth of expression data covering many organisms, tissues, developmental stages, diseases and treatments is now available for meta-analyses, system biology studies and use in secondary databases. combining results from several independent studies allows improved detection of differentially expressed genes and analysis of biological pathways and co-expression networks . these vast transcriptomic resources have been also extensively used for functional gene annotation and reanalysis of lists of candidate genes obtained with high-throughput experiments. these tasks are facilitated by large secondary databases such as genevestigator , biogps , the gene expression atlas or bgee that allow mining of many microarray experiments at the same time. additionally, there are many more specialized databases, which, for example, collect data only from a selected species or for diseases , or provide resources for more specific analyses, such as coxpresdb for studying co-expressed genes or tisged for the analysis of tissue-specific gene expression . the quality of results that can be derived from meta-analysis and database searches of microarray data depends directly on the quality of the arrays themselves. despite this, there are still no objective criteria that allow discrimination between low-and high-quality arrays . by quality in this context, we understand the agreement between microarray gene expression-level estimations and true gene expression profile. a proper quality control procedure should report whether the amount of biological information captured by the microarray experiment is sufficient to answer a particular biological question. the most common approach to quality assessment of microarray results makes the assumption that the majority of arrays in each dataset is of good quality, and various parameters serve to identify outlier arrays . this task is relatively easy when the dataset is large, but the analysis often lacks power when only a few arrays are analyzed together. moreover, in the case of a dataset with a high proportion of low-quality arrays (e.g. microarray results derived from degraded rna samples), the good-quality arrays might actually be removed to decrease variability of the dataset. this approach is also powerless to detect datasets composed only of low-quality samples. most of the existing methods of quality control of affymetrix microarrays use specific features of these chips, such as control probes, pairs of mismatch (mm) and perfect match (pm) probes, or the fact that there are many probes gathered in probe sets targeting the same transcript. the degradation of transcripts starts from the 3 0 end; thus, the ratio of abundance of 5 0 3 0 ends serves in molecular biology practice as an indicator of to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.
