blockclust: efficient clustering and classification of non-coding rnas from short read rna-seq profiles non-coding rnas (ncrnas) play a vital role in many cellular processes such as rna splicing, translation, gene regulation. however the vast majority of ncrnas still have no functional annotation. one prominent approach for putative function assignment is clustering of transcripts according to sequence and secondary structure. however sequence information is changed by post-transcriptional modifications, and secondary structure is only a proxy for the true 3d conformation of the rna polymer. a different type of information that does not suffer from these issues and that can be used for the detection of rna classes, is the pattern of processing and its traces in small rna-seq reads data. here we introduce blockclust, an efficient approach to detect transcripts with similar processing patterns. we propose a novel way to encode expression profiles in compact discrete structures, which can then be processed using fast graph-kernel techniques. we perform both unsupervised clustering and develop family specific discriminative models; finally we show how the proposed approach is scalable, accurate and robust across different organisms, tissues and cell lines. availability: the whole blockclust galaxy workflow including all tool dependencies is available atgenome-wide sequencing revealed that dna is pervasively transcribed, with the majority of the dna encoding for non-coding rnas (ncrnas) . ncrnas are important parts of cellular regulation that were long ignored but have received an increasing level of attention over the past decade. there have been reports of up to 450 000 predicted ncrnas in the human genome alone , the vast majority of them having no functional annotation. while the exact numbers, and even the magnitude, of regulators and interactions are of course a matter of discussion, they reflect the current challenge for the analysis of whole-transcriptome data. comparatively assigning a putative function to ncrnas requires the detection of rna families or classes with a common function. rna families contain sequences that are related via evolution, whereas the members of rna classes are defined only by a common function without evolutionary relationship, with mirnas and snornas being well-known examples. rfam is the largest known collection of known rna families. however, only a minor part of the transcriptome is covered by those examples. for that reason, will et al.there are, however, several caveats if one relies only on the genomic sequence and its predicted secondary structure. first, the genomic sequence is often changed by post-transcriptional modifications. the database of rna modification pathwayslists 144 types of modifications, from methylation of rna bases to editing events like c-to-u or a-to-i editing [see e.g. su and randau (2011) or. second, the reliability of the classification depends on the quality of secondary-structure prediction, which is often low [see e.g.. the reason is not only that the energy model for secondary structure is incomplete, but rna modifications and the influence of rna-binding proteins also add layers of complexity. in the case of transcriptome data, an additional problem is that often the full transcript is not seen in the deep sequencing. this implies that one has to perform local secondary-structure prediction, which is an even harder task . third, relying on structure is optimal for structured ncrna, but would miss many long ncrnas that often do not have a conserved structure [for a review, see e.g.. there is, however, a similarity other than the genomic sequence and its predicted secondary structure that can be used for the detection of rna classes, namely the pattern of processing and its traces in small rna-seq reads data . the reason is simply that these processing patterns depend on the functional molecule and its 3d-structure, and thus should carry information not only about the structure of the polymer but also about all modifications and processing of the rna molecule. this is well understood for prominent examples like mirna, where most pre-mirna have a hairpin structure with a 2-nt 3 0 overhang that are processed into a double-stranded rna consisting of the mirna and its complement mirna [see e.g., for alternative processing modes see e.g.. computational approaches for finding new mirnas in deep sequencing data such as mirdeep rely on the detection of traces of this process . it has now become clear that this is not limited to mirna. instead, class specific slicing of widely expressed ncrnas (but to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university

smaller rnas is a widespread regulatory mechanism . examples are trna, where there are several species of trna-derived fragments such as trna halves, 5 0 trf, 3 0 u trf or 3 0 cca trf are known . similarly, snorna-derived (sdrnas) fragments are specific for the snorna class and the size and position distribution of the sdrnas are conserved across species . in this article, we introduce blockclust, an efficient approach to detect transcripts with similar processing patterns. we propose a novel way to encode expression profiles in compact discrete structures, which can then be processed using fast graph-kernel techniques. note that in this work we do not deal with long rna sequences such as messenger rnas which require to deal with exon boundaries or with extreme variability in length and expression levels, rather we consider the transcripts that are retrieved from small rna-seq protocols and we therefore optimize blockclust to process transcripts characteristic of small ncrnas of length 50200 nt. we perform both unsupervised clustering and develop ncrna family specific discriminative models; finally we show how the proposed approach is scalable, accurate and robust across different organisms or experimental protocols.
