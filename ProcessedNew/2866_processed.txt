structural bioinformatics memory-efficient rna energy landscape exploration motivation: energy landscapes provide a valuable means for studying the folding dynamics of short rna molecules in detail by modeling all possible structures and their transitions. higher abstraction levels based on a macro-state decomposition of the landscape enable the study of larger systems; however, they are still restricted by huge memory requirements of exact approaches. results: we present a highly parallelizable local enumeration scheme that enables the computation of exact macro-state transition models with highly reduced memory requirements. the approach is evaluated on rna secondary structure landscapes using a gradient basin definition for macro-states. furthermore, we demonstrate the need for exact transition models by comparing two barrier-based approaches, and perform a detailed investigation of gradient basins in rna energy landscapes. availability and implementation: source code is part of the c++ energy landscape library available atthe driving force of disordered systems in physics, chemistry and biology is characterized by coupling and competing interaction of microscopic components. at a qualitative level, this is reflected by the potential energy function and often results in complex topological properties induced by individual conformational degrees of freedom. it seems fair to say that it is practically impossible to compute dynamic and thermodynamic properties directly from the hamiltonian of such a complex system. however, analyzing the underlying energy landscape and its features directly provides a valuable alternative. here, we focus on rna molecules and their folding kinetics. rnas are key players in cells acting as regulators, messengers, enzymes and many more roles. in many cases, a specific structure is crucial for biological specificity and functionality. the formation of these functional structures, i.e. the folding process, can be studied at the level of rna energy landscapes . rna is composed of the biophysical alphabet a,c,g,u and has the ability to fold back onto itself by formation of discrete base pairs, thus forming secondary structures. the latter provide a natural coarse-graining for the description of the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of rna because, in contrast to proteins, the secondary structure of rna captures most of the folding free energy. this is accommodated by novel approaches for predicting 3d rna structures from secondary structures . formally, an rna secondary structure is defined as a set of base pairs between the nuclear bases complying with the rules: (i) only a-u, g-c and g-u pairings are allowed, (ii) any base is involved in maximal one base pair and (iii) the structure is nested, i.e. there are no two base pairs with indices (i, j), (k,l) with i 5 k5j5l. summation over the individual base pair binding energies and entropic contributions for unpaired bases defines the energy function e . the degeneracy of this energy definition is countered via a structure ordering based on their string encoding . we refer to the literature for more details. in this work, we study the folding kinetics of rna molecules by means of a discrete energy landscape approach. while stochastic folding simulations based on solving the master equation are limited to relatively short sequence lengths , a common approach to studying biopolymer folding dynamics is using a coarse-grained model that partitions the energy landscape into distinct basins of attraction, thus assigning macro-states to each basin . the basin decomposition and computation has been described in different contexts, including potential energy landscapes , rna kinetics and lattice protein folding . given appropriate transition rates between macro-states (optionally composed of rates among micro-states that form a macro-state), the dynamics can be modeled as continuous-time markov process and solved directly by numerical integration . while suitable for system sizes up to $10 000 states, improvements to this approach are currently subject to our research, allowing investigation of up to a few hundred thousand states by incorporating sparsity information and additional approximations. to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this is an open

partial enumeration of the energy landscape are not applicable to large systems because of memory restrictions. on the other side, sampling with high precision requires long sampling times . therefore, approximating the energy landscape by a subset of important local minima, gained via sampling approaches or spectroscopic methods , and transition paths between them (no e and) has been investigated in the past . we propose a novel, highly parallelizable and memoryefficient local enumeration approach for computing exact transition probabilities. while the method is intrinsically generic and can be readily applied to other discrete systems, we exemplify the concept in the context of energy landscapes of rna secondary structures, based on the turner energy model , as implemented in the vienna rna package and the energy landscape library (ell;). we evaluate the memory efficiency and dynamics quality for different rna molecules and report features of gradient basin macro-states in rna energy landscapes.we have introduced a local flooding scheme for computing the exact macro-state transition rates for arbitrary discrete energy landscapes, provided some macro-state assignment is available. the approach has been evaluated on rna secondary structure energy landscapes in the context of modeling coarse-grained rna folding kinetics based on gradient basins. we have demonstrated the need for exact macro-state transition models via comparison with a simpler barrier tree-based arrhenius-like model. the latter resulted in significantly different dynamics measured by mean fpt. we showed that the local flooding scheme requires several orders of magnitude less memory compared with the standard global flooding scheme. furthermore, it is intrinsically open to vast parallelization, which should also result in significant runtime reduction, given that the global flooding can not be easily parallelized. finally, we performed a thorough investigation of gradient basins in rna energy landscapes because they are commonly used as macro-state abstraction in the field. gradient basins have been shown to be generally small, which is the reason for the tremendously reduced memory requirement of the local flooding scheme. the basin of the unstructured state has been shown to be special, as it is the largest, most connected macro-state and covers the energetically highest micro-states. independent of their size, most basins contain micro-states of almost the entire energy range above their respective local minimum. the majority of the gradient basins covers only states with positive energy. we found a low average connectivity between gradient basins, the existence of few highly connected hub nodes and a high correlation of connectivity with basin size.
