gene expression cop: a database for characterizing co-expressed gene modules with biological information in plants using a large dataset (10 022 assays) obtained from public plant microarray databases, we developed the cop database for associating co-expressed gene modules with biological information such as gene ontology terms and, if available, metabolic pathway names. the confeito algorithm developed previously in our laboratory, which is suitable to calculate the interconnectivity between genes in co-expressed gene network, was applied to extract co-expressed gene modules. the database includes the gene modules for arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress) and seven crops, glycine max (soybean), hordeum vulgare (barley), oryza sativa (rice), populus trichocarpa (poplar), triticum aestivum (wheat), vitis vinifera (grape) and zea mays (maize).since the decoding of the arabidopsis genome , information on genome sequences and gene expression in plants has accumulated in public databases. many microarray datasets assembled from various experiments (e.g. different tissues and chemical treatments), including the atgenexpress datasets of arabidopsis , have been utilized to predict co-expressed genes for assigning them to metabolic pathways , transcriptional regulation and/or biological processes . there are several databases that are designed to extract coexpressed genes from plant microarray datasets and then provide biological information with individual genes in the co-expressed gene group, facilitating investigation of gene function (see the review of). cross-species comparison of relevant co-expressed gene groups is also useful, as seen in the database genecat that provides comparative analysis of arabidopsis and barley co-expressed genes on the basis of sequence similarity. association of co-expressed gene modules intentionally with biological information such as gene ontology (go) and metabolic pathways would be useful. however, to our knowledge, there is no such database available. thus, we havepage: 1268 12671268
