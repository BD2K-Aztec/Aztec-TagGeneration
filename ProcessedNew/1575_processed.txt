systems biology enabling interspecies epigenomic comparison with cepbrowser we developed the comparative epigenome browser (cepbrowser) to allow the public to perform multi-species epigenomic analysis. the web-based cepbrowser integrates, manages and visualizes sequencing-based epigenomic datasets. five key features were developed to maximize the efficiency of interspecies epigenomic comparisons. availability: cepbrowser is a web application implemented with php, mysql, c and apache. url: http://www.cepbrowser.org/.epigenomes play pivotal roles in cell identity, organismal development and disease processes , contribute to regulating cognition and behavior and reflect personal variation . by integrating environmental signals with genomic instructions, epigenomes are instrumental in bridging genotypic variation and phenotypic diversity. leveraging a number of high-throughput sequencing enabled technologies, large international consortia are aiming to generate 41000 epigenomes from normal tissues and associated disease conditions . analyzing and interpreting epigenomic information has become a pressing need. the successes obtained in associating epigenomic marks with genomic features inspired initial efforts of systematic annotation of chromatin states . however, our current capability of interpreting epigenomic information is still primitive. the concept of using cross-species comparison to annotate epigenomic functions may revolutionize epigenomic analysis . indeed, by exploiting the link between evolutionary selection and regulatory functions, comparative epigenomics have annotated epigenomes with unprecedented details . we have developed the comparative epigenome browser (cepbrowser) to allow the public to perform multi-species epigenomic analysis. the web-based cepbrowser extends the concepts of the ucsc and ensembl genome browsers to integrate, manage and visualize large sequencing-based datasets for cross-species comparisons.
