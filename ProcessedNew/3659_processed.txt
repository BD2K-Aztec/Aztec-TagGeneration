predicting the functional consequences of cancer-associated amino acid substitutions motivation: the number of missense mutations being identified in cancer genomes has greatly increased as a consequence of technological advances and the reduced cost of whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing methods. however, a high proportion of the amino acid substitutions detected in cancer genomes have little or no effect on tumour progression (passenger mutations). therefore, accurate automated methods capable of discriminating between driver (cancer-promoting) and passenger mutations are becoming increasingly important. in our previous work, we developed the functional analysis through hidden markov models (fathmm) software and, using a model weighted for inherited disease mutations, observed improved performances over alternative computational prediction algorithms. here, we describe an adaptation of our original algorithm that incorporates a cancer-specific model to potentiate the functional analysis of driver mutations. results: the performance of our algorithm was evaluated using two separate benchmarks. in our analysis, we observed improved performances when distinguishing between driver mutations and other germ line variants (both disease-causing and putatively neutral mutations). in addition, when discriminating between somatic driver and passenger mutations, we observed performances comparable with the leading computational prediction algorithms: spf-cancer and transfic. availability and implementation: a web-based implementation of our cancer-specific model, including a downloadable stand-alone package, is available at http://fathmm.human cancers are characterized by the accumulation of somatic mutations, e.g. gross insertions and deletions, as well as the more subtle single base pair substitutions , some of which confer a growth advantage on the tumour cells . the catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer (cosmic) is an online repository of somatic mutation data, which includes amino acid substitutions (aass). the identification of cancerpromoting aass (driver mutations) promises to lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease, as well as providing potential diagnostic and therapeutic markers . however, this remains a major challenge, as the majority of aass detected in cancer genomes do not contribute to carcinogenesis; rather, these passenger mutations are a consequence of tumorigenesis rather than a cause . therefore, accurate automated computational prediction algorithms capable of distinguishing between driver and passenger mutations are of paramount importance. a review bydescribes the performance of several computational prediction algorithms using a gold standard validation benchmark (sasidharan). in our previous work, we developed the functional analysis through hidden markov models (fathmm) algorithm and, using a model weighted for inherited disease mutations, observed improved performance accuracies over alternative computational prediction methods using the same benchmark . however, the value of traditional computational prediction algorithms in cancer genomics remains unclear . for example, the shared characteristics between driver and other disease-causing mutations allow for a significant proportion of cancer-associated mutations to be identified (high-sensitivity/true positive rate); however, these methods are incapable of reliably distinguishing between driver and other disease-causing mutations. furthermore, with respect to carcinogenesis, a large proportion of passenger mutations are still misclassified as having a role in tumour progression (low-specificity/true negative rate). as a result, several cancer-specific computational prediction algorithms capable of distinguishing between driver mutations and other germ line variants (both disease-causing and putatively neutral mutations) and/or capable of discriminating between somatic driver and passenger mutations have been developed . in this work, we describe an adaptation to our original algorithm, which amalgamates sequence conservation within hidden markov models (hmms), representing the alignment of to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author(s) 2013. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. homologous sequences and conserved protein domains, with pathogenicity weights, representing the overall tolerance of the corresponding model to mutations , to potentiate the functional analysis of driver mutations. using a model weighted for cancer-associated mutations, we observe performance accuracies, which outperform alternative computational prediction algorithms when distinguishing between driver and other germ line mutations (both disease-causing and neutral polymorphisms). furthermore, when discriminating between driver and passenger mutations (somatic), we observe performance accuracies comparable with other state-of-the-art computational prediction algorithms . a web-based implementation of our algorithm, including a high-throughput batch submission facility and a downloadable stand-alone package, is available at http://fathmm.biocompute.org.uk.in this article, we described an adaptation to the functional analysis through hidden markov models (fathmm) algorithm in which a cancer-specific weighting scheme was incorporated to potentiate the functional analysis of driver mutations. the performance of our method was then benchmarked against four alternative computational prediction algorithms: sift and polyphen-2 , mutation assessor and spf-cancer ; using the capriotti and altman (2011) benchmarking datasets. in terms of performance accuracies, fathmm seems to be the best performing method available when assigned with the task of distinguishing between driver mutations and other germ line polymorphisms (both disease-causing and neutral). furthermore, when tasked with discriminating between driver and passenger mutations (somatic), our method seems to perform as well as the alternative leading prediction algorithm: spf-cancer. although the performance of our algorithm in this category does not represent an improvement over spfcancer, our method offers a large-scale/high-throughput batch submission facility capable of analysing all foreseeable genomic/ cancer datasetsan important facility that is not offered with spf-cancer. in addition, to facilitate a comparison between our algorithm and another leading computational prediction algorithm: chasm , we performed a 2-fold cross-validation procedure and observed an improved performance when using our method. we also compared the performance of our algorithm with four computational prediction algorithms: sift , polyphen-2 , mutation assessor and transfic , using a published benchmark . once again, we observed improved performance accuracies over traditional computational prediction algorithms: sift, polyphen-2 and mutation assessor; and we noted comparable performances with the mutation assessor transfic. in any fair comparison, care should be taken to reduce the potential overlap between the mutation datasets used for training and testing; however, this level of testing is not possible, as it would require obtaining and retraining each algorithm with common datasets. to remove the potential bias in our results, we performed a 20-fold cross-validation procedure across our benchmark. from this analysis, we observed no significant deviations in the performance of our algorithm and, therefore, concluded that the performances observed were not an artefact of the weighting scheme used. the potential benefits of incorporating cancer-specific information into our predictions were assessed by comparing the performance of our cancer-specific weighting scheme with the performance of our original inherited-disease weighting scheme. in accordance with previous findings , we observed some similarities in driver scores/predictions between the two weighting schemes. however, we noted improved odds in identifying driver/passenger mutations using a cancerspecific weighting scheme. unsurprisingly, we also noted significantly improved odds in correctly classifying disease-causing (non-neoplasm) mutations as having no effect on tumour progression. therefore, by incorporating a cancer-specific weighting scheme, we have shown that our method is capable of identifying mutations that directly contribute to carcinogenesis, irrespective of other underlying disease associations. to facilitate the analysis of large-scale cancer genomic datasets, our public web server (available at http://fathmm.biocompute.org.uk) provides unrestricted and near instant predictions for all possible amino acid substitutions within the human proteome. for example, we were capable of annotating the entire cosmic databasecomprising of over half a million mutationsin51 h using a single processing core. in addition, we also provide an open-source software package allowing users to run our algorithm using their high-performance computing systems.
