metamapr: pathway independent metabolomic network analysis incorporating unknowns metabolic network mapping is a widely used approach for integration of metabolomic experimental results with biological domain knowledge. however, current approaches can be limited by biochemical domain or pathway knowledge which results in sparse disconnected graphs for real world metabolomic experiments. metamapr integrates enzymatic transformations with metabolite structural similarity, mass spectral similarity and empirical associations to generate richly connected metabolic networks. this open source, web-based or desktop software, written in the r programming language, leverages kegg and pubchem databases to derive associations between metabolites even in cases where biochemical domain or molecular annotations are unknown. network calculation is enhanced through an interface to the chemical translation system, which allows metabolite identifier translation between 200 common biochemical databases. analysis results are presented as interactive visualizations or can be exported as high-quality graphics and numerical tables which can be imported into common network analysis and visualiza-tion tools. availability and implementation: freely available at http://dgrapov.github.io/metamapr/. requires r and a modern web browser. installation instructions, tutorials and application examples are available at http://dgrapov.github.io/metamapr/.metabolomic experiments contain both high-dimensional and complex biological, chemical and analytical information. mass spectrometry based analyses can generate measurements for many hundreds to thousands of small molecules. in addition to compounds with identified biological roles many measurements may only contain mass spectral or empirical information. analysis of metabolomic data in the context of biological domain knowledge (e.g. enzymatic precursor to product relationships) is a wellestablished approach for metabolic network generation . however, real world metabolomic experiments can measure a wide range of biochemical domains [for example (for which direct biochemical intermediates may be absent or unknown, leading to sparse disconnected biochemical representations. inclusion of non-measured metabolites in the reconstructed metabolic networks using tools like metscape can help overcome this issue, but requires calculation of minimum spanning trees, which can still fail to associate metabolites lacking biochemical domain knowledge (e.g. complex lipids).recently showed in their tool metamapp that structural similarity information can be used to enhance enzymatic transformation networks and fill in the gaps between missing biochemical intermediates or domains. however, neither metamapp nor metscape directly calculate structural similarity, mass spectral similarity nor empirical relationships, and lack standalone interactive network visualization and threshold tuning interfaces featured in metamapr. in addition to biochemical transformations and structural similarity, metamapr also incorporates mass spectral
