thermodynamics of rna structures by wangâ€“landau sampling motivation: thermodynamics-based dynamic programming rna secondary structure algorithms have been of immense importance in molecular biology, where applications range from the detection of novel selenoproteins using expressed sequence tag (est) data, to the determination of microrna genes and their targets. dynamic programming algorithms have been developed to compute the minimum free energy secondary structure and partition function of a given rna sequence, the minimum free-energy and partition function for the hybridization of two rna molecules, etc. however, the applicability of dynamic programming methods depends on disallowing certain types of interactions (pseudoknots, zigzags , etc.), as their inclusion renders structure prediction an nondeterministic polynomial time (np)-complete problem. nevertheless, such interactions have been observed in x-ray structures. results: a non-boltzmannian monte carlo algorithm was designed by wang and landau to estimate the density of states for complex systems, such as the ising model, that exhibit a phase transition. in this article, we apply the wang-landau (wl) method to compute the density of states for secondary structures of a given rna sequence, and for hybridizations of two rna sequences. our method is shown to be much faster than existent software, such as rnasubopt. from density of states, we compute the partition function over all secondary structures and over all pseudoknot-free hybridizations. the advantage of the wl method is that by adding a function to evaluate the free energy of arbitary pseudoknotted structures and of arbitrary hybridizations, we can estimate thermodynamic parameters for situations known to be np-complete. this extension to pseudoknots will be made in the sequel to this article; in contrast, the current article describes the wl algorithm applied to pseudoknot-free secondary structures and hybridizations. availability: the wl rna hybridization web server is under construction atrna is an important biomolecule, now known to play both an information carrying role, as well as a catalytic role. indeed, the genomic information of retroviruses, such as the hepatitis c and human immunodeficiency viruses, is encoded by rna rather than dna, while the peptidyl transferase reaction, arguably the most important enzymatic reaction responsible for life, is catalyzed not by a protein, but rather by rna . it has recently emerged that rna plays a wide range of previously unsuspected roles in many biological processes, including retranslation of the to whom correspondence should be addressed. genetic code [selenocysteine insertion , ribosomal frameshift (, transcriptional and translational gene regulation , temperaturesensitive conformational switches , chemical modification of specific nucleotides in the ribosome , regulation of alternative splicing , etc. a secondary structure for a given rna nucleotide sequence a 1 ,...,a n is a set s of base pairs (i,j), such that a i ,a j forms either a watsoncrick or gu (wobble) base pair, and such that there are no base triples or pseudoknots in s. 1 for example, the secondary structure of y rna 2 with embl access code aapy01489510/220-119 is displayed inand b, whileand d depicts the pseudoknotted structure of the gag/pro ribosomal frameshift site of mouse mammary tumor virus . in conventional dot-bracket notation, this latter structure is given as follows, where it should be noted that two kinds of bracket are needed due to the pseudoknot aaaaaacuuguaaaggggcaguccccuagccccgcucaaaagggggaug ..............it is computationally intractable to compute the minimum freeenergy tertiary structure of rna; indeed, determining the optimal pseudoknotted structure is nondeterministic polynomial time (np)complete lyngso and pedersen (2000). in contrast, by disallowing pseudoknots, secondary structure prediction is algorithmically tractable; there are dynamic programming algorithms to compute the minimum free-energy structure for a single rna molecule, as well as for the hybridization of two or more rna molecules. in particular, such methods can be loosely grouped into two types of algorithm those that use (i) a stochastic context free grammar to compute a covariation model and (ii) free-energy parameters obtained from uv absorbance (optical melting) experiments, in order to determine the minimum free energy structure (i.e. thermodynamic-based algorithms). examples of stochastic context-free grammars are the programs infernal and pfold . examples of thermodynamics-based algorithms are the programs mfold , unafold , rnafold , rnastructure . thermodynamics-based algorithms for hybridization of two structures are given in unafold , rnacofold , while the nupack software considers hybridization of three or more rna molecules. pseudoknot-free secondary structure of y rna with embl access code aapy01489510/220-119, depicted in (a) in feynman circular form, and in panel (b) in classical form.
