causal network inference using biochemical kinetics motivation: networks are widely used as structural summaries of biochemical systems. statistical estimation of networks is usually based on linear or discrete models. however, the dynamics of biochemical systems are generally non-linear, suggesting that suitable non-linear formulations may offer gains with respect to causal network inference and aid in associated prediction problems. results: we present a general framework for network inference and dynamical prediction using time course data that is rooted in non-linear biochemical kinetics. this is achieved by considering a dynam-ical system based on a chemical reaction graph with associated kinetic parameters. both the graph and kinetic parameters are treated as unknown; inference is carried out within a bayesian framework. this allows prediction of dynamical behavior even when the underlying reaction graph itself is unknown or uncertain. results, based on (i) data simulated from a mechanistic model of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and (ii) phosphoproteomic data from cancer cell lines, demonstrate that non-linear formulations can yield gains in causal network inference and permit dynamical prediction and uncertainty quantification in the challenging setting where the reaction graph is unknown. availability and implementation: matlab r2014a software is available to download fromstatistical network inference techniques are widely used in the analysis of multivariate biochemical data . these techniques aim to make inferences regarding a network n whose vertices are identified with biomolecular components (e.g. genes or proteins) and edges with (direct or indirect) regulatory interplay between those components. network inference methods are typically rooted in linear or discrete models whose statistical and computational advantages facilitate exploration of large spaces of networks (e.g.). on the other hand, when the network topology is known, non-linear ordinary differential equations (odes) are widely used to model biochemical dynamics . the intermediate case where ode models are used to select between candidate networks has received less attention. we propose a general framework called chemical model averaging (chema) that uses biochemical ode models to carry out both network inference and dynamical prediction. in summary, we consider a dynamical system dx=dt=f g x; where the state vector x contains the abundances of molecular species, g is a chemical reaction graph that characterizes reactions in the system, f g is a kinetic model that depends on g, and collects together all unknown kinetic parameters. a causal network n is obtained as a coarse summary n(g) of the reaction graph g in which each chemical species appears as a single node, and directed edges indicate that the parent is involved in chemical reaction(s), which have the child as product (we make these notions precise below). given time course data d consisting of noisy measurements of x, we carry out inference and prediction within a bayesian framework. in particular, we treat g itself as unknown and make inference concerning it using the posterior distribution,where the marginal likelihood pdjg captures how well the chemical reaction graph g describes data d, taking into account both parameter uncertainty and model complexity and pjg is a prior density over the kinetic parameters. in contrast to linear or discrete models that are motivated by tractability, our likelihood pdj; g depends on (richer) reaction graphs g and their associated kinetics. this article makes three contributions: (i) a general framework for joint network learning and dynamical prediction using ode models, (ii) a specific implementation (chema 1.0), rooted in michaelismenten kinetics, that uses metropolis-within-gibbs sampling to allow bayesian inference at feasible computational cost and (iii) an empirical investigation, using both simulated and experimental time course data, of the performance of chema 1.0 relative to several existing approaches for network inference and dynamical prediction. the statistical connection between linear odes and network inference using linear models has been discussed in oates and mukherjee (2012) and exploited in. several approaches based on non-linear odes have been proposed, including aij o and l ahdesm aki (2010);. this article extends these ideas by formulating a bayesian approach to both network inference and dynamical prediction that is rooted in chemical kinetics. bayesian model selection based on nonlinear odes has been shown to be a promising strategy for to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution non-commercial license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/), which permits non-commercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. for commercial re-use, please contact journals.permissions@oup.com elucidation of specific signaling mechanisms (e.g.). our work differs in motivation and approach in that we exploit automatically generated rather than hand-crafted biochemical models, thereby allowing full network inference without manual specification of candidate models.performed bayesian model selection by comparing steady-state data with equilibrium solutions of automatically generated ode models. this article extends this approach to time course data and prediction of dynamics. there are several considerations that motivate chema: (i) inference in biological systems is complicated by correlations between components that are co-regulated but not causally linked. it is well known that, under a linear formulation, the causal network n is in general unidentifiable . for example, it may not be possible to orient certain edges, or edges may be inferred between co-regulated nodes due to strong associations between them. non-linear kinetic equations, in contrast, are able to confer asymmetries between nodes and may be sufficient to enable orientation of edges , although we note that causal inference using non-linear models still requires a number of strong assumptions . as a consequence, chema can in principle aid in causal network inference, and empirical results below support this. (ii) in contrast to linear models, in chema, the mechanistic roles of individual variables are respected. this facilitates analysis of data obtained under specific molecular interventions and enhances scientific interpretability. (iii) prediction of dynamical behavior (e.g. response to a stimulus or to a drug treatment) in general depends on the chemical reaction graph. in settings where the graph itself is unknown or uncertain (e.g. due to genetic or epigenetic context), chema allows prediction of dynamics by averaging over an ensemble of (automatically generated) candidate reaction graphs. the chema framework is general and can in principle be used in many settings where kinetic formulations are available to describe the dynamics, including gene regulation, metabolism and protein signaling. for definiteness, in this article, we focus on protein signaling networks mediated by phosphorylation and provide a specific implementation of the general framework. phosphorylation kinetics have been widely studied , and ode formulations are available, including those based on michaelismenten kinetics . the remainder of the article is organized as follows. first, we introduce the model and associated statistical formulation. second, we discuss network inference and dynamical prediction within this framework. third, we show empirical results, on simulated and experimental data, comparing chema 1.0 with several existing approaches. finally, we discuss our findings and suggest several directions for further work.we proposed a general framework for using chemical kinetics in network inference and dynamical prediction. the use of chemical kinetics can be expected to contribute gains in causal inference because the underlying models are not structurally symmetric, allowing causal directionality to be established . in empirical results, we found that while chema 1.0 struggled to identify kinetic parameters from data, it was nevertheless able to identify the causal network; this discrepancy is explained by the fact that the latter is in a sense a projection of the former, and can be identifiable even when the full set of parameters are not. an important challenge in systems biology is to predict the effect on signaling of a novel intervention, such as a drug treatment. at present, dynamical predictions in systems biology require a known chemical reaction graph, for instance, taken from the literature; a system of odes is usually specified based on such a graph and used for prediction. however, in many settings, the chemical reaction graph may differ depending on cell type or disease state and cannot be assumed known. in contrast, chema shows how prediction of dynamical behavior may be possible even when the reaction graph itself is unknown a priori. unlike more convenient linear or discrete formulations, our use of chemical kinetic models provides interpretable predictions. for example, the dynamic behavior of phosphoprotein concentrations obtained under chemical kinetic rate laws is physically plausible (i.e. smooth, bounded and non-negative). furthermore, by averaging predictions over reaction graphs, our approach should provide robustness in (typical) situations where it is unreasonable to expect to identify g precisely. nevertheless, prediction of trajectories based on the protein data was challenging, likely because of noise and small sample sizes (supplementary). we anticipate that continuing technical advances will move high-throughput proteomics closer to the favorable simulation regimes in section 3.2 on which we found the richer nonlinear models to be useful. several improvements can be made to the chema 1.0 implementation reported here, of which we highlight two: (i) gradient matching (rather than numerical solution of the automatically generated dynamical systems) can help to relieve the computational demands associated with exploration the large model spaces, but the euler approximations we used for this purpose are crude. improved gradient matching should be possible (at the expense of requiring more time points) via higher-order expansions, or (at the expense of additional modeling assumptions) kernel regression, the penalized likelihood approaches ofchema include inference of model parameters and computation of marginal likelihoods for model selection. the second is an active area of research, with candidate approaches including variational approximations and mcmc . in general, the computational burden of chema will be higher than many methods (see supplementary material). by way of illustration, bayesian inference and prediction for a system of 27 protein species required over 12 h (serial) computational time. in contrast, linear or discrete models offer better scalability to high-dimensional settings. thus, chema can complement existing methodologies but is not at present applicable to truly high-dimensional problems with hundreds or thousands of nodes. finally, we note the following caveats: (i) the automatic generation of kinetic equations limits the extent to which detailed knowledge about particular biochemical processes and dynamics may be incorporated. (ii) our empirical results suggest that more complex interactions, including kinase inhibition, can be extremely difficult to identify in practice. (iii) the form of kinetics used here will likely be suboptimal when the assumptions of the michaelismenten approximation are violated. (iv) larger training and test datasets may be needed to allow truly effective trajectory prediction and comprehensive assessment of performance.
