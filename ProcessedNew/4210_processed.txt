sesame (sequence sorter & amplicon explorer): genotyping based on high-throughput multiplex amplicon sequencing characterizing genetic diversity through genotyping short amplicons is central to evolutionary biology. next-generation sequencing (ngs) technologies changed the scale at which these type of data are acquired. sesame is a web application package that assists genotyping of multiplexed individuals for several markers based on ngs amplicon sequencing. it automatically assigns reads to loci and individuals, corrects reads if standard samples are available and provides an intuitive graphical user interface (gui) for allele validation based on the sequences and associated decision-making tools. the aim of sesame is to help allele identification among a large number of sequences. availability: sesame and its documentation are freely available under the creative commons attribution-noncommercial-sharealike 3.0 unported licence for windows and linux fromsince the breakthrough of pcr in the 1980s, researchers have been using various dna markers and approaches to characterize the genetic diversity such as microsatellites, single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (aflp). however, direct sequencing of dna loci from a large number of individuals was costly and labor intensive. this was even further an issue for nuclear markers where cloning must precede sanger sequencing to disentangle alleles. technical advances involved in next-generation sequencing (ngs) technologies, including clonal amplification (454 , roche) or single molecule sequencing (smrt , pacific bioscience), open new horizons where gigabases of dna sequences can be obtained easily. one can take advantage from these innovations to directly and massively sequence amplicons. however, this approach necessitates tagging individual amplicons and sorting out real alleles from reads with sequencing errors. we have created sesame as a user-friendly web application package for analyzing amplicon sequences obtained through ngs, where the amplicon is completely covered by a read. it includes automatic sequence assignation to multiple markers and individuals via oligonucleotide tags. it provides an intuitive point-and-click interface to validate sequences as allele from individual-based variant alignments. the results are exported as genotypes or sequences of alleles. to our knowledge, no similar software has been published that accomplishes all these tasks.obtaining high number of sequences for amplicons from nuclear markers brings new challenges with regard to deciphering alleles from each other and distinguishing weakly amplified alleles from sequencing errors. with this respect, bioinformatics tools did not cope yet with the analysis of amplicons sequenced in this highthroughput environment. moreover, user-friendly tools are needed for sorting and analyzing this type of data, as end users are interested in the biological information and do not necessarily have programming or sharp bioinformatics skills. sesame fills this gap and makes routine sequencing as dna barcoding of a large number of amplicons at hand. sesame is resolutely oriented toward biologists with regard to user-friendly interfacing and easy installation. furthermore, most functions to support analyses are unique and provide a strong and productive framework for highthroughput amplicon sequencing. conflict of interest: none declared.
