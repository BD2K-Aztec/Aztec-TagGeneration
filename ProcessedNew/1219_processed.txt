databases and ontologies curation, integration and visualization of bacterial virulence factors in patric motivation: weve developed a highly curated bacterial virulence factor (vf) library in patric (pathosystems resource integration center, www.patricbrc.org) to support infectious disease research. although several vf databases are available, there is still a need to incorporate new knowledge found in published experimental evidence and integrate these data with other information known for these specific vf genes, including genomic and other omics data. this integration supports the identification of vfs, comparative studies and hypothesis generation, which facilitates the understanding of virulence and pathogenicity. results: we have manually curated vfs from six prioritized niaid (national institute of allergy and infectious diseases) category ac bacterial pathogen genera, mycobacterium, salmonella, escherichia, shigella, listeria and bartonella, using published literature. this curated information on virulence has been integrated with data from genomic functional annotations, trancriptomic experiments, protein protein interactions and disease information already present in patric. such integration gives researchers access to a broad array of information about these individual genes, and also to a suite of tools to perform comparative genomic and transcriptomics analysis that are available at patric. availability and implementation: all tools and data are freely available at patric (http://patricbrc.org).virulence factors (vfs) are an important class of gene products that help pathogens to evade a specific hosts defensive mechanisms to establish infection in a specific environmental condition, thereby resulting in a disease state for that host. studying vfs facilitates our understanding of pathogenicity and infectious disease mechanisms, and helps researchers to develop new methods for disease prevention and therapy . there are a few existing vf databases that provide comprehensive collections of bacterial vf genes, such as vf database (vfdb; http://www.mgc.ac.cn/vfs), mvirdb (http:// mvirdb.llnl.gov) and victors (http://www.phidias.us/victors). these resources link published information about virulence directly to the genes or to protein families that contain the genes . other resources, like uniprot and kegg (kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes), designate specific genes as vfs without necessarily showing the published support of this declaration . despite these resources, there remains a need to further identify vf genes, link them with published experimental evidence and integrate that data with the wealth of omics data that can reveal protein function, expression patterns or other information that show the genes role in virulence and the disease processes. the pathosystems resource integration center (patric) is the all-bacterial bioinformatics resource center designed to support basic and applied biomedical research on bacterial infectious diseases . patric supports a variety of diverse data types such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteinprotein interactions, 3d protein structures and dna sequence typing data with their associated metadata. patric also provides analysis tools for genome annotation, comparative genomics, transcriptomics, pathways, hostpathogen interaction and disease-related information . integrating bacterial vf genes is a logical next step in these data integration effort. in the present work, we manually curated vfs from six prioritized national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) category ac bacterial pathogen genera (http://www. niaid.nih.gov/topics/biodefenserelated/biodefense/pages/cata.aspx), mycobacterium, salmonella, escherichia, shigella, listeria and bartonella, and integrated the curated information into patric. in addition, we also integrated the vf information from vfdb and victors into patric. the resulting integrated information can be easily accessed and visualized through patrics web interface. by leveraging the curated vfs, the information from both vfdb and victors and the preexisting patric resources, patrics vf module enables users to access the comprehensive omics, and host-pathogen disease information about the vf genes, perform comparative genomic and transcriptomics analysis for these vfs and store the analyzed information in their private workspace. the private workspace then becomes an important hypothesis-generating capability for bench biologists to advance vf knowledge and develop counter measures. to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. all rights reserved this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.
