databases and ontologies ramigo: an r/bioconductor package providing an amigo visualize interface the r/bioconductor package ramigo is an r interface to amigo that enables visualization of gene ontology (go) trees. given a list of go terms, ramigo uses the amigo visualize api to import graphviz-dot format files into r, and export these either as images (svg, png) or into cytoscape for extended network analyses. ramigo provides easy customization of annotation, highlighting of specific go terms, colouring of terms by p-value or export of a simplified summary go tree. we illustrate ramigo functionalities in a genome-wide gene set analysis of prognostic genes in breast cancer. availability and implementation: ramigo is provided in r/biocon-ductor, is open source under the artistic-2.0 license and is available with a user manual containing installation, operating instructions and tutorials. it requires r version 2.15.0 or higher.the r/bioconductor package ramigo provides an easy-to-use r interface to the amigo visualize web server. it provides a simple and elegant way to retrieve graphviz trees that display hundreds of go ids at once and efficiently study clusters or subcomponents of the go tree in graph form. ramigo provides functions to convert a go tree into different formats and display it in cytoscape without leaving the r environment. ramigo is therefore a perfect companion to gsea and go analyses in r, as it helps one better analyse and interpret the long, and sometimes complex, lists of go identifiers that these analyses produce.
