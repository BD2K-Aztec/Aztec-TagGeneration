structural bioinformatics yasara view—molecular graphics for all devices—from smartphones to workstations todays graphics processing units (gpus) compose the scene from individual triangles. as about 320 triangles are needed to approximate a single spherean atomin a convincing way, visualizing larger proteins with atomic details requires tens of millions of triangles , far too many for smooth interactive frame rates. we describe a new approach to solve this molecular graphics problem, which shares the work between gpu and multiple cpu cores, generates high-quality results with perfectly round spheres, shadows and ambient lighting and requires only opengl 1.0 functionality, without any pixel shader z-buffer access (a feature which is missing in most mobile devices). availability and implementation: yasara view, a molecular model-ing program built around the visualization algorithm described here, is freely available (including commercial use) for linux, macos, windows and android (intel) from www.yasara.org.in 1966, cyrus levinthal pioneered molecular graphics at the massachusetts institute of technology, when he set up the first interactive wire-frame display of a protein on a monochrome oscilloscope . since then, molecular graphics has made tremendous progress, mostly thanks to the video game industry, which induced the rise of graphics processing units (gpus). today many different molecular visualizers are available, e.g. vmd , chimera , pymol or qutemol , each using different tricks to boost rendering performance and quality. we describe an algorithm that can cope with two specific difficulties: first, it does not depend on high-end shader tricks and thus works on smartphones too. and second, it does not require expensive precalculation steps that depend on atom positions. it can thus visualize moving atoms, allowing to perform interactive molecular dynamics simulations on smartphones and tablets.
