x-mate: a flexible system for mapping short read data accurate and complete mapping of short-read sequencing to a reference genome greatly enhances the discovery of biological results and improves statistical predictions. we recently presented rna-mate, a pipeline for the recursive mapping of rna-seq datasets. with the rapid increase in genome re-sequencing projects, progression of available mapping software and the evolution of file formats, we now present x-mate, an updated version of rna-mate, capable of mapping both rna-seq and dna datasets and with improved performance, output file formats, configuration files, and flexibility in core mapping software.
