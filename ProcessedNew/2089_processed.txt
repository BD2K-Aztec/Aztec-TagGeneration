gohtam: a website for 'genomic origin of horizontal transfers, alignment and metagenomics' motivation: this website allows the detection of horizontal transfers based on a combination of parametric methods and proposes an origin by researching neighbors in a bank of genomic signatures. this bank is also used to research an origin to dna fragments from metagenomics studies. results: different services are provided like the possibility of inferring a phylogenetic tree with sequence signatures or comparing two genomes and displaying the rearrangements that happened since their separation. availability and implementation: http://horizontal transfers (hts) are a major force of evolution and this website proposes methods for their detection. the genomic signature was demonstrated to be species-specific and allows ht detection in terms of tetranucleotide frequencies . parametric methods were designed to work only with the information contained in genomic sequences. they rely either on the whole set of genes or on local variations of genomic signature . recently, a benchmark has determined the most efficient parametric methods in different conditions and has proposed to use a combination of methods to analyze hts in genomes . this site provides user-friendly access to such methods as well as some unique features including signaturebased phylogeny and potential origin of a set of metagenomics sequences.
