sequence analysis pathogen detection using short-rna deep sequencing subtraction and assembly motivation: early and accurate detection of human pathogen infection is critical for treatment and therapeutics. here we describe pathogen identification using short rna subtraction and assembly (srsa), a detection method that overcomes the requirement of prior knowledge and culturing of pathogens, by using degraded small rna and deep sequencing technology. we prove our approachs efficiency through identification of a combined viral and bacterial infection in human cells.early and accurate detection of microbial pathogens in both clinical and environmental samples is critical for effective public health care, treatment and therapeutics. most pathogen detection methods [polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification or microarrays] rely on prior knowledge of the exact sequence of the potential pathogen, or the ability to cultivate the pathogen (for microbial cultures), which is unreasonable in many cases . an alternative detection technique recently offered, which circumvents these limitations, is the sequencing of infected cells and the subsequent comparison of these sequences to a reference pathogen library for identification . given the massive increase in nucleic acid sequence databases of all organisms, and the advancement in massive parallel sequencing technologies, sequencing possibly infected samples evolves as an increasingly prominent and logical alternative for pathogen characterization. the major advantages of this approach are the unbiased detection of all known pathogens, overcoming the requirement for cultivation of slow-growing and fastidious microbial agents; the ability to recognize pathogens, even at minute expression levels; simultaneous identification of several microbial agents in a co-infected sample; and the rapid turnaround and processing.
