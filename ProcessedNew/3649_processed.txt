predicting protein interactions via parsimonious network history inference motivation: reconstruction of the network-level evolutionary history of proteinprotein interactions provides a principled way to relate interactions in several present-day networks. here, we present a general framework for inferring such histories and demonstrate how it can be used to determine what interactions existed in the ancestral networks, which present-day interactions we might expect to exist based on evolutionary evidence and what information extant networks contain about the order of ancestral protein duplications. results: our framework characterizes the space of likely parsimonious network histories. it results in a structure that can be used to find probabilities for a number of events associated with the histories. the framework is based on a directed hypergraph formulation of dynamic programming that we extend to enumerate many optimal and near-optimal solutions. the algorithm is applied to reconstructing ancestral interactions among bzip transcription factors, imputing missing present day interactions among the bzips and among proteins from five herpes viruses, and determining relative protein duplication order in the bzip family. our approach more accurately reconstructs ancestral interactions than existing approaches. in cross-validation tests, we find that our approach ranks the majority of the left-out present-day interactions among the top 2 and 17 of possible edges for the bzip and herpes networks, respectively, making it a competitive approach for edge imputation. it also estimates relative bzip protein duplication orders, using only interaction data and phylogenetic tree topology, which are significantly correlated with sequence-based estimates. availability: the algorithm is implemented in c, is open source and is available atimproved techniques for understanding how collections of protein interactions have evolved over time have a number of applications. for example, they can help identify stable and rewired modules and protein complexes . the quality of inferred networks under various parameters can help estimate the probabilities of different evolutionary events or correct for phylogenetic branch lengths . ancestral network reconstruction has been explored to improve network alignment algorithms . the study of ancestral metabolic pathways can reveal how changes in metabolic pathways relate to changes in the environment . zhang and) apply network evolution inference to improve inference of regulatory networks in present-day species. previous algorithms for network history reconstruction include the use of graphical models , greedy local search and extensions thereof , maximum-likelihood inference and other approaches .introduced a new parsimony framework that modeled the problem as one of finding the fewest number of interaction gain and loss events that reconstruct the observed present-day networks. many of these previous approaches find only one possible network history and make inferences based on that single history. however, there may be a large number of optimal and near-optimal histories. a priori, we do not know how different these solutions may be, or how representative of the ensemble the solution at which we arrive is. further, although maximum-likelihoodbased approaches do not necessarily produce a single history,suggest that such estimators may not generally characterize the posterior-weighted ensemble of solutions well. a maximum-likelihood network history inference method has been applied to the problem of predicting regulatory interactions in present-day networks . however, that approach requires a known complete ordering of the duplication events in each homology group, which our approach does not. further, being based on a parameterized network evolution model, it requires the estimation of numerous model parameters. to overcome these limitations, we present an approach, based on a novel algorithm and advanced dynamic programming techniques, which is able to efficiently characterize the relevant portion of the space of network histories without resorting to sampling. by formulating our dynamic program in the forward hypergraph framework , it becomes clear how to explore the space of solutions. we develop an extension of the k-best parsing algorithm ofthat allows us to aggregate solutions of equivalent quality. as a result, rather than enumerating individual solutions, we are able to enumerate solution classes (i.e. the set of all solutions having the same cost) and provide a characterization of the space of optimal and nearoptimal solutions to an instance of the network history inference problem. inspired by, we call this method a sum-over-parsimonious-histories (soph) approach to to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2013. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article

certain approaches in natural language processing, our approach for generating a weighted ensemble of parsimonious solutions is novel and may also prove useful in other areas of computational biology. for every potential interactioneither ancestral or extant our algorithm computes the posterior probability, summed over an ensemble of parsimonious and near-parsimonious histories, which the interaction exists. we show this approach outperforms the graphical model formulation used in pinney et al.(2007) and dutkowski and tiuryn (2007). further, as posterior probabilities are provided for all potential interactions (including extant ones) that participate in the ensemble, we are able to impute missing interactions and to quantify the consistencyin terms of evolutionary parsimonyof a given set of interactions. when applied to the problem of predicting ancestral interactions among bzips, the soph approach is particularly beneficial when noise is added to the present-day networks. these noisy networks simulate the common scenario in which the measurement of present-day interactions is error-prone. the soph method seems to be both accurate and robust. further, anecdotally,argue that the interaction between kshv-1 proteins ul33 and ul31 is highly conserved across many herpes species, and we find that our soph approach predicts an ancestral interaction between the orthology groups of these proteins with the second highest probability among all potential ancestral interactions. we test the approachs ability to predict missing edges in present-day networks, and we show that it often outperforms a state-of-the-art approach for edge prediction based on network topology . on the bzip transcription factor network, where we perform leave-one-out, 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validation, we find that our approach most often puts edges from the test set in the top 1 of the probabilities assigned to pairs. we also perform edge prediction on a collection of five herpes virus protein interaction networks in a similar leave-one-out setting (the data are too sparse for higher-fold cross-validation). here, the left-out edge is, on average, in the top 25 of high-probability edges. we also breakdown performance based on which orthology groups the interaction participants are members of, and find that the good performance is driven by generally good performance for most pairs of orthology groups. as these data are believed to have highfalse-negative rate, there surely are real missing edges in the given present-day networks, meaning the actual performance is likely in fact better. the ensemble of parsimonious network histories encoded by our framework can be used to answer other types of queries about the network histories that are not even possible in existing maximum-likelihood approaches that work based on interaction trees. as an illustration, we use the soph framework to predict the relative duplication order between pairs of ancestral bzip proteins. existing maximum-likelihood approaches cannot perform this task, as a total order of duplication events is required for the inference procedure used by those algorithms. we find that the relative duplication orders predicted by our soph framework, which were predicted without the use of phylogenetic branch length information, are significantly correlated with the duplication order derived from the protein sequences.we now describe the performance of the soph framework for the three inference tasksancestral network reconstruction, missing interaction imputation and determination of relative protein duplication orderset forth in section 1.we have introduced a novel sum-over-histories method for solving the network history inference problem. it addresses shortcomings of existing methods by using a weighted ensemble consisting of all optimal and near-optimal parsimonious histories. we show that this makes the results robust to the presence of noise in the input (section 4.1) and allows our parsimony approach to outperform the probabilistic approach to ancestral network reconstruction at all considered noise levels. the algorithms we present have practical running times. our implementation required only 1.5 min to computein serial the results for all cross-validation experiments on the herpes virus datasets (an average of 51 s per experiment). on the significantly larger bzip dataset, the algorithm requires 6.5, 8.5, 10.4, 12.4, 14.4, 16.9 and 34.4 s, respectively, to compute solutions using the top 1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 100 cost classes, suggesting an empirically linear relationship between the running time and the number of requested cost classes. the sum-over-histories approach is also general and allows many other questions to be answered about how a sequence of proteins, and their interactions have evolved. we find that our method can reliably exploit evolutionary evidence to discover the existence of missing interactions. soph may be useful in prioritizing low-throughput but high-accuracy protein interaction experiments by suggesting which interactions are more likely than others to exist given the current experimental and evolutionary evidence. the soph approach also recovers the ultrametric temporal ordering relationships between duplication events well, without using any direct information about sequence or branch lengths.
