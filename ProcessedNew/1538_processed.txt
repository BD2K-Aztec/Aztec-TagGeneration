efficient algorithms for the reconciliation problem with gene duplication, horizontal transfer and loss motivation: gene family evolution is driven by evolutionary events such as speciation, gene duplication, horizontal gene transfer and gene loss, and inferring these events in the evolutionary history of a given gene family is a fundamental problem in comparative and evolutionary genomics with numerous important applications. solving this problem requires the use of a reconciliation framework, where the input consists of a gene family phylogeny and the corresponding species phylogeny, and the goal is to reconcile the two by postulating speciation, gene duplication, horizontal gene transfer and gene loss events. this reconciliation problem is referred to as duplication-transfer-loss (dtl) reconciliation and has been extensively studied in the literature. yet, even the fastest existing algorithms for dtl reconciliation are too slow for reconciling large gene families and for use in more sophisticated applications such as gene tree or species tree reconstruction. results: we present two new algorithms for the dtl reconciliation problem that are dramatically faster than existing algorithms, both asymptotically and in practice. we also extend the standard dtl reconciliation model by considering distance-dependent transfer costs, which allow for more accurate reconciliation and give an efficient algorithm for dtl reconciliation under this extended model. we implemented our new algorithms and demonstrated up to 100 000-fold speed-up over existing methods, using both simulated and biological datasets. this dramatic improvement makes it possible to use dtl reconciliation for performing rigorous evolutionary analyses of large gene families and enables its use in advanced reconciliation-based gene and species tree reconstruction methods. availability: our programs can be freely downloaded fromgene families evolve through complex evolutionary processes such as speciation, gene duplication, horizontal gene transfer and gene loss. accurate inference of these events is crucial not only to understanding gene and genome evolution but also for reliably inferring orthologs, paralogs, and xenologs (to whom correspondence should be addressed); reconstructing ancestral gene content and dating gene birth ; accurate gene tree reconstruction ; and for whole genome species tree reconstruction . indeed, the problem of inferring gene family evolution has been extensively studied. in the typical formulation of this problem, the goal is to reconcile an input gene tree (gene family phylogeny) to the corresponding rooted species tree by postulating speciation, duplication, transfer and loss events. much of the previous work in gene treespecies tree reconciliation has focused on either duplication loss (dl) or transfer loss (tl) , but not on duplication, transfer and loss together. however, duplication and transfer events frequently occur together, particularly in prokaryotes, and the analysis of such families requires reconciliation methods that can simultaneously consider duplication, transfer and loss events. this problem of gene treespecies tree reconciliation by duplication, transfer and loss simultaneously is referred to as the duplication tl (dtl) reconciliation problem. previous work. the dtl reconciliation problem has a long history and is well studied in the literature. this is partly due to its close association with the hostparasite cophylogeny problem which seeks to understand the evolution of parasites (analogous to genes) within hosts (analogous to species). almost all known formulations of the dtl reconciliation problem are based on a parsimony framework (but see alsofor an example of a probabilistic formulation, as well asfor a probabilistic framework based on gene content). under this framework, each duplication, transfer and loss event is assigned a cost and the goal is to find a reconciliation that has the lowest total reconciliation cost. optimal dtl reconciliations can sometimes violate temporal constraints; that is, the transfers are such that they induce contradictory constraints on the dates for the internal nodes of the species tree. we refer to such paradoxical reconciliations as time-inconsistent (after). in general, it is desirable to consider only those dtl reconciliations that are time-consistent (i.e. paradox-free). henceforth, we refer to the problem of specifically computing optimal time-consistent
