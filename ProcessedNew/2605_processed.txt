genome analysis jetta: junction and exon toolkits for transcriptome analysis high-throughput genome-wide studies of alternatively spliced mrna transcripts have become increasingly important in clinical research. consequently, easy-to-use software tools are required to process data from these studies, for example, using exon and junction arrays. here, we introduce jetta, an integrated software package for the calculation of gene expression indices as well as the identification and visualization of alternative splicing events. we demonstrate the software using data of human liver and muscle samples hybridized on an exonjunction array. availability: jetta and its demonstrations are freely available atrecent developments of high-throughput technologies, such as exonjunction arrays and rna-seq , have extended transcriptome studies in biomedical research beyond the scope of gene expression. these genomic platforms enable the genome-wide measurements of alternative splicing (as), the process by which individual exons of the same gene are spliced to produce different isoforms of mrna transcripts, in clinical samples and animal disease models. this, in turn, requires computational algorithms and software tools for data analyses and visualization. we have developed an integrated software package, jetta, that provides a one-stop solution for gene expression and as analyses of microarray data, from raw data files to visualization. the software provides many options for array normalization, probe selection, background correction, expression index computation, as detection and data visualization. it can also be potentially utilized for as detections from rna-seq data. here, we describe jetta in an analysis of human liver and muscle tissues assayed on a custom exonjunction gg-h array .
