structural bioinformatics gsatools: analysis of allosteric communication and functional local motions using a structural alphabet motivation: gsatools is a free software package to analyze conform-ational ensembles and to detect functional motions in proteins by means of a structural alphabet. the software integrates with the widely used gromacs simulation package and can generate a range of graphical outputs. three applications can be supported: (i) investigation of the conformational variability of local structures; (ii) detection of allosteric communication; and (iii) identification of local regions that are critical for global functional motions. these analyses provide insights into the dynamics of proteins and allow for targeted design of functional mutants in theoretical and experimental studies. availability: the c source code of the gsatools, along with a set of pre-compiled binaries, is freely available under gnu general public license frombiomolecular motions play a key role in several biological functions: enzymatic activity, proteinprotein interactions, ligand binding and allosteric regulation. computational approaches, such as molecular dynamics (md), are now routinely used to reproduce the intrinsic dynamics of proteins, but effective tools are still required to gain functional insight from the simulated data. global collective motions are often associated with biological functions, and it was demonstrated that these motions can be extracted from conformational ensembles . in a previous study, we suggested a method aimed at recovering the role of local conformational changes in functional motions . to this purpose, we developed a structural alphabet (sa): a set of 25 canonical states of fourresidue protein fragments (c atoms only) describing the most probable local conformations in high-resolution protein structures. therefore, the sa provides a means for the coarse-grained annotation and processing of local conformations in a string format, which lends itself to a range of efficient sequence analysis algorithms. the sa has been used successfully in analyzing local changes in implicit solvent simulations , allosteric signal transmission and conformational changes on effector binding . here, we present gsatools, a set of sa-related tools interfacing with gromacs for the analysis of conformational ensembles. gsatools is a software package designed for the investigation of the conformational dynamics of local structures, the functional correlations between local and global motions and the mechanisms of allosteric communication.
