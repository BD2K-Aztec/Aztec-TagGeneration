genome analysis accusaâ€”accurate snp calling on draft genomes next generation sequencing technologies facilitate genome-wide analysis of several biological processes. we are interested in whole-genome genotyping. to our knowledge, none of the existing single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) callers consider the quality of the reference genome, which is not necessary for high-quality assemblies of well-studied model organisms. however, most genome projects will remain in draft status with little to no genome assembly improvement due to time and financial constraints. here, we present a simple yet elegant solution (accusa) that considers both the read qualities as well as the reference genomes quality using a bayesian framework. we demonstrate that accusa is as good as the current snp calling software in detecting true snps. more importantly, accusa does not call spurious snps, which originate from a poor reference sequence.
