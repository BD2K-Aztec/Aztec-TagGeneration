blindcall: ultra-fast base-calling of high-throughput sequencing data by blind deconvolution motivation: base-calling of sequencing data produced by high-throughput sequencing platforms is a fundamental process in current bioinformatics analysis. however, existing third-party probabilistic or machine-learning methods that significantly improve the accuracy of base-calls on these platforms are impractical for production use due to their computational inefficiency. results: we directly formulate base-calling as a blind deconvolution problem and implemented blindcall as an efficient solver to this inverse problem. blindcall produced base-calls at accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art probabilistic methods while processing data at rates 10 times faster in most cases. the computational complexity of blindcall scales linearly with read length making it better suited for new long-read sequencing technologies. availability and implementation: blindcall is implemented as a set of matlab scripts available for download atsecond-generation sequencing technology has revolutionized high-throughput genomics in life science and clinical research. the sheer scale of sequence generated by these instruments has allowed unprecedented views into a number of molecular phenomena, including population genetics, transcriptomics, epigenetics and translational profiling. both the throughput and accuracy of second-generation sequencing instruments has increased at an accelerated pace in the last few years due to the use of high-resolution optics and biochemical methods that allow sequencing of billions of dna fragments in parallel by generating fluorescence intensity signals that can be decoded into dna sequences. however due to experimental and hardware limitations, these raw signals are inherently noisy . base-calling is the essential step of converting these noisy fluorescent intensity signals into sequences used in downstream analysis. providing accurate base-calls greatly reduces many difficulties in downstream bioinformatics analysis like genome assembly and variant calling . sequencing-by-synthesis generates millions of reads of short dna sequences by measuring in parallel the fluorescence intensity of billions of pcr-amplified and labeled clusters of dna from a sample of interest. the dna fragments attach to a glass surface where it is then pcramplified in situ to create a cluster of dna fragments with identical nucleotide composition. sequence reads are generated from these dna clusters in parallel and by cycles. a single nucleotide is sequenced from all dna clusters in parallel by adding labeled nucleotides that incorporate to their complementary nucleotide. this synthesizes dna fragments complementary to the fragments in each cluster as sequencing progresses. a set of four images is created measuring the fluorescence intensity along four channels to detect incorporation at each cycle. these images are then processed to produce fluorescence-intensity measurements from which sequences are then inferred by basecalling. in the default base-calling process for illumina sequencers, called bustard, the highest intensity in each quadruplet of intensity measurements determines the base at the corresponding position of the corresponding read. for current illumina technologies, sequencers can produce up to 600 gb per run . the raw intensity signals generated by this process are known to be subject to several biases (and b). (i) cross talk: there are significant correlations between different nucleotide channels; (ii) phasing/pre-phasing: the signal in one cycle can spread to the cycles ahead and the cycles after it; (iii) signal decay: where signal intensities become lower in later sequencing cycles; (iv) background noise: the signal to noise ratio becomes lower in later sequencing cycles. a significant challenge in base-calling is accounting for these biases. existing base-calling methods can be classified into two major groups: (i) unsupervised model-based methods that capture the sequencing-by-synthesis process in a statistical model of fluorescence intensity from which base-call probabilities can be extracted directly and(ii) supervised methods that train a statistical model on a set of base-calls whereby fluorescence intensity measurements are classified into base-calls . the former methods have been shown to significantly improve the accuracy of bustard base-calls. these model-based methods aim to capture the sequencing process described above in a statistical model from which base-call probabilities are usually obtained. while these probabilistic or machine-learning methods improve to

they are impractical for use due to their computational inefficiency, which usually scales quadratically with read length since most of them resort to dynamic programming for model fitting . in this article, we show that the base-calling problem can be formulated as an optimization problem called blind deconvolution. based on this observation, we developed blindcall as a method that treats base-calling as a blind deconvolution problem . we model intensity signals (b) output by the sequencer as the convolution of a latent sparse signal of interest x and a convolution kernel k modeling crosstalk and phasing biases, plus background noise n: b k x n:the blind deconvolution problem is to recover the latent signal x given only the observed b. this reduces the base-calling problem into solving an inverse problem that admits computationally efficient solutions. the blind deconvolution problem has been a research hotspot in recent years and we adapt methods for its solution to the base-calling problem . blindcall was able to provide base-calls at comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art probabilistic methods while processing data at rates ten times or faster in most cases. it scales linearly with read length and is thus better suited for new long-read sequencing technologies. direct blind deconvolution modeling and the ultra-efficient processing based on optimization methods presented here are essential for bioinformatics analysis workflows to cope with increased throughput and read lengths in new sequencing technologies.blindcall is implemented as a set of matlab scripts available at http://cbcb.umd.edu/hcorrada/secgen. as an example of its computational efficiency, running blindcall on a single-core matlab instance on an intel i7 3610qm laptop with 2.33.3 ghz processor and 8 gb of memory, we found that it was able to process 1 million bases/s, or 485 billion bases/cpu day. we note that a significant portion of its running time (50) is spent on disk io to read intensity data and write the fasta/fastq outputs. to the best of our knowledge, blindcall is one of the fastest base-callers available at this time, even though it is implemented in a scripting language. a port of this algorithm into a lowerlevel language (c/c) will give further improvements on speed over the current matlab version. we compared the running time of blindcall to the state-of-the art probabilistic base-caller ayb and the state-of-the-art supervised learning method freeibis on a dataset of 1.9 million reads from a phix174 run on an illumina hiseq 2000 . we found that blindcall was able to process this dataset $20 times faster than ayb and 10 times faster than freeibis while retaining similar accuracy. a plot of per cycle error rate of these basecallers shows that all methods produce significant improvements over bustard, especially in later sequencing cycles. we observed a similar pattern when testing other datasets . we also obtained better assemblies, especially at low coverage, using blindcall, ayb and freeibis relative to bustardayb, accuracy and run times for bustard. freeibis and blindcall for a dataset of 1.9 million reads from a hiseq 2000 run of phix174. blindcall fast corresponds to noniterative version of the blind-deconvolution method. running times for blindcall are reported as (processing time/total time), where the total time includes reading intensity data from disk and writing base-calls to disk. for freeibis, we report the time as (predicting time with single thread/ training time with 10 threads). blindcall was able to produce base-calls of comparable accuracy to ayb and freeibis at significantly faster computational time (8 min/12 min versus 217 min and 126 min, respectively). it is also faster than bustard (8 min/12 min versus 17 min). ayb, freeibis and blindcall all improve on bustard base calls. we also compared assemblies of the phix174 genome using reads generated by bustard, blindcall, freeibis and ayb. the reported n50s and max contig lengths are averages4100 random samples with the corresponding coverage (5, 10 or 20). while blindcall is able to process data at a significantly lower computational cost, the assemblies obtained using blindcall are of comparable quality to those obtained using ayb or freeibis.blindcall is a simple and ultra-fast non-probabilistic base-calling method for illumina high-throughput sequencing data based on blind deconvolution. we have shown that it provides comparableaccuracy for bustard, ayb and blindcall on various datasets. blindcall was able to produce comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art base callers at significantly faster computational time. all methods improve on bustard base calls. run times for blindcall are reported as (training time/processing time/total time in minutes) where the total time includes reading intensity data from disk and writing base-calls to disk.. base-calling by blind deconvolution is scalable to long read lengths. we compare the computational time of blindcall with a stateof-the-art probabilistic base caller ayb, the state-of-the-art supervised learning method freeibis and illuminas bustard on the phix174 dataset reported inas a function of the number of sequencing cycles. since most model-based base callers resort to a dynamic programming solution, running time is quadratic with respect to the read length. in contrast, blindcall scales linearly with read length. base callers based on the blind deconvolution framework will be able to scale as sequencers produce longer reads. freeibis also scales linearly but is much slower than blindcall. third-party base callers improve bustard per-cycle error rate. we plot error rate of each base-caller per sequencing cycle on the phix174 test data. all three base callers significantly improve accuracy over bustard, especially in later cycles. blindcall is able to achieve comparable accuracy while processing data at a much faster rate
