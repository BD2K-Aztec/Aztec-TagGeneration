accurate extension of multiple sequence alignments using a phylogeny-aware graph algorithm motivation: accurate alignment of large numbers of sequences is demanding and the computational burden is further increased by downstream analyses depending on these alignments. with the abundance of sequence data, an integrative approach of adding new sequences to existing alignments without their full re-computation and maintaining the relative matching of existing sequences is an attractive option. another current challenge is the extension of reference alignments with fragmented sequences, as those coming from next-generation metagenomics, that contain relatively little information. widely used methods for alignment extension are based on profile representation of reference sequences. these do not incorporate and use phylogenetic information and are affected by the composition of the reference alignment and the phylogenetic positions of query sequences. results: we have developed a method for phylogeny-aware alignment of partial-order sequence graphs and apply it here to the extension of alignments with new data. our new method, called pagan, infers ancestral sequences for the reference alignment and adds new sequences in their phylogenetic context, either to predefined positions or by finding the best placement for sequences of unknown origin. unlike profile-based alternatives, pagan considers the phylogenetic relatedness of the sequences and is not affected by inclusion of more diverged sequences in the reference set. our analyses show that pagan outperforms alternative methods for alignment extension and provides superior accuracy for both dna and protein data, the improvement being especially large for fragmented sequences. moreover, pagan-generated alignments of noisy next-generation sequencing (ngs) sequences are accurate enough for the use of rna-seq data in evolutionary analyses. availability: pagan is written in c++, licensed under the gpl and its source code is available atsequence alignment has numerous applications but its role is especially central in evolutionary analyses of molecular sequences. to whom correspondence should be addressed.these inferences are based on the identities and differences detected between homologous characters and errors in these homology statements, that is errors in the alignment of the sequences, are likely to lead to errors in any downstream analyses. the generation of high-quality alignments can be computationally laborious and the solutions often require manual assessment or editing. when such alignments need to be extended, e.g. after new sequences become available, it may be preferable to keep the relative alignment of existing sequences intact and have the new sequences aligned to this reference alignment. such addition of sequences should take into account the evolutionary relationships of all the sequences and be performed in the correct phylogenetic context. alignment extension has interesting applications in the analyses of next-generation sequencing (ngs) data. fast profile-based methods have been used for the alignment of metagenomic sequence reads of unknown origin against a set of reference sequences in phylogenetic placement studies . these do not use all information available in the data, however, and flatten the reference alignment into a consensus profile that only models conserved regions shared by most sequences. on the other hand, existing read placement methods based on phylogenyaware alignment handle the query sequences separately and delete sites inferred as insertions, limiting their use to phylogenetic placement only. accurate alignment of complete ngs reads is of interest e.g. in analyses of rna-seq data that come nearly exclusively from the gene regions of the genomes. with appropriate handling of short and noisy reads, rna-seq data allow for inexpensive large-scale comparative studies of proteincoding genes, such as inferences of selection , and extend the use of ngs methods to evolutionary analyses of non-model organisms (e.g. http://www.onekp.com). popular progressive alignment programs (e.g.) indirectly exploit the connection between alignment and phylogeny as they divide the computationally intractable multiple alignment problem into many pairwise tasks. yet, they ignore the phylogeny during the remainder of the alignment process and produce alignments whose gap patterns are not evolutionarily meaningful . we showed earlier that phylogenetic information can be used to distinguish insertions from deletions and these two very different mutation events can then be treated correctly in the progressive alignment . the phylogeny-aware algorithm based on these ideas and implemented in the program prank performs very well in evolutionary alignment comparisons .the first alignment creates graph x to represent the inferred ancestor of a and b. in x, the character state of vertex 5 is y, representing both pyrimidines, and has two incoming edges, from vertices 2 and 4, to indicate that the presence of vertices 3 and 4 is uncertain.the optimal alignment path for graphs x and c jumps from vertex 2 in graph x to vertex 5 using the direct connecting edge; the edges flanking the skipped-over fragment are recorded as unused (asterisks)here, we outline a new general-purpose method for phylogenyaware alignment of sequence graphs and apply it to phylogenetic extension of existing alignments. our method, called pagan, is based on the same principle as prank and uses evolutionary information to distinguish insertions from deletions. in contrast to the greedy insertion-calling of the original approach, sequence graphs provide a flexible framework to model the phylogenetic evidence from related sequences and allow building a robust progressive aligner that tolerates errors in the guide phylogeny. the idea of using graphs to represent a sequence alignment is old and has been revisited regularly . our approach has similarities to earlier methods for global alignment of multiple sequences, especially the tree alignment method and the sequence representation with partial-order graphs , but differs from these in its emphasis on phylogenetic calling of insertion and deletion events. the key advantage of our graph representation of sequences is the ability to describe uncertainty regarding the presence of characters at certain sequence positions. this is beneficial during the progressive alignment of sequences but it can also be used to represent uncertainties in unaligned sequences or in the inferred ancestral sequences. as our approach considers all sequences as graphs that can be aligned against each other, it is easily extended to the placement of new sequences into existing reference alignments. unlike most existing methods based on consensus sequence profiles, our approach correctly considers the phylogenetic context as it aligns new sequences against inferred ancestors. moreover, it can add multiple related sequences to specific positions in the tree and thus correctly accounts for their relatedness and shared insertion and deletion events .sequences, assumed to come from the species shown in red, to the same target node in a progressive manner. it reconstructs sequence graphs to represent the ancestral nodes and aligns the new sequences against the ancestor of their sister clade, indicated by x. each alignment of a sequence, r n , creates a new parent node, p n , against which the next sequence is aligned. after finishing the alignment, the sub-tree with the new sequences is inserted back to the tree structurewe tested pagan in the extension of real reference alignments with new protein and dna sequences and found that it can successfully handle data of great variety in length and evolutionary divergence as well as different sizes of reference alignments. the accuracy of alignment cannot be tested with real data so we simulated datasets representing gene families of closely related paralogues. we used pagan to extend both protein and dna reference alignments with new data and compared its performance with that of alternative extension approaches. to test larger problems, we used pagan and the best alternative method, hmmalign , for a re-analysis of metagenomic data ofconsisting of reference alignments of 500 sequences and addition of 5000 sequence fragments. finally, we quantified the effects of different factors on alignment accuracy and compared pagan and hmmalign under a simplified setup that allowed changing the different parameters independently. our results show that pagan produces exceptionally accurate alignments and its phylogenetic approach can efficiently use the evolutionary information available while remaining unimpaired by more distantly related sequences in the reference alignment.we have generalized the concepts of our phylogeny-aware alignment algorithm and developed a method for phylogenetic alignment of partial-order sequence graphs. in this article, we focus on one specific application for the new method that has no satisfactory previous solution, the phylogeny-aware extension of existing alignments with new data. re-computation of alignments for largely the same sets of sequences is wasteful and may occasionally introduce errors that require manual verification and corrections. extension of existing alignments with new sequences avoids these problems and guarantees that the relative alignment of reference sequences is not changed. the new sequences should also be accurately aligned, however, and we strongly believe that this is best achieved by aligning them in their phylogenetic context, against the targets resembling them most. this is true for all sequences but its importance is even more pronounced in the alignment of short sequence fragments containing little information. we performed comprehensive simulation studies to compare the performance of our new method, pagan, to that of alternative methods for alignment extension and to test how the different approaches utilize the information available in related sequences. we focused on the accuracy of inferred evolutionary homology with the aim of using the resulting alignments for evolutionary studies. our analyses show that pagans phylogenetic approach clearly outperforms most alternative methods, the improvement being especially striking in the alignment of short sequence fragments. we were impressed by the good performance of hmmalign but also noticed that its performance is highly dependent on the reference alignment used for the construction of the profile hmm. with a carefully chosen reference alignment, hmmaligns accuracy was in some cases comparable to that of pagan. in reallife analyses, one cannot typically maximize both the sensitivity of the profile hmm and the breath of sequences included, and the widely used practice of including all the diversity available heavily penalizes hmmaligns performance. in contrast, pagan is a truly phylogenetic method and, while it efficiently uses the information from closely related sequences, it is not affected by the inclusion of more distantly related ones in the reference set. we tested pagan in the extension of large alignments and found the initial results very promising. we believe that improvements in the assignment of queries to target nodes and speed-ups in the algorithm will make pagan also a competitive method for largescale metagenomic analyses. unlike alternative methods for the task, pagan aligns also insertion sites and includes full-length sequences in the resulting multiple alignment. the latter may not be crucial in phylogenetic placement of query fragments relative to the reference sequences but it will provide additional information to resolve the relations between the newly added sequences and will allow connecting related fragments to longer contigs. alignment extension and phylogenetic placement has interesting applications in the analyses of increasingly abundant sequencing
