sparse multi-view matrix factorization: a multivariate approach to multiple tissue comparisons motivation: within any given tissue,rna abundance, as the results of active gene expression, affects cell differentiation and tissue development . as such, it provides a snapshot of the undergoing biological process within certain cells or a tissue. except for house-keeping genes, the expressions of a large number of genes vary from tissue to tissue, and some may only be expressed in a particular tissue or a certain cell type . the regulation of tissue-specific expression is a complex process in which a genes enhancer plays a key role regulating gene expressions via dna methylation (ong and v c the author 2015. published by oxford university press. all rights reserved. for permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com 31633171 doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btv344
