data and text mining hts navigator: freely accessible cheminformatics software for analyzing high-throughput screening data we report on the development of the high-throughput screening (hts) navigator software to analyze and visualize the results of hts of chemical libraries. the hts navigator processes output files from different plate readers formats, computes the overall hts matrix, automatically detects hits and has different types of baseline navigation and correction features. the software incorporates advanced che-minformatics capabilities such as chemical structure storage and visualization, fast similarity search and chemical neighborhood analysis for retrieved hits. the software is freely available for academic laboratories.with the growing number of academic centers (such as uclas molecular screening shared resourcesmssr, nimhs psychoactive drug screening programpdsp or molecular libraries screening center networkmlscn) conducting high-throughput screening (hts) comes the need for processing hts results efficiently. some of these centers have the potential to screen up to 200 000 compounds against several panels of targets (e.g. gpcrs, kinases). as a result, significant amounts of screening data are generated, which require extensive management and analysis. several commercial software packages (e.g. spotfire by tibco, vortex by dotmatics) are available to conduct these data analysis and mining tasks, but these are relatively expensive, have fixed sets of features and are not necessarily suited for academic structures and small biotech companies. as a consequence, there is a need for freely available and easily customizable software capable of visualizing and analyzing hts results with an eye toward more extensive and chemical analysis using advances in cheminformatics for hts data analysis (kummel).
