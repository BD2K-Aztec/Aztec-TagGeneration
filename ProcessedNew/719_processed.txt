bgt: efficient and flexible genotype query across many samples bgt is a compact format, a fast command line tool and a simple web application for efficient and convenient query of whole-genome genotypes and frequencies across tens to hundreds of thousands of samples. on real data, it encodes the haplotypes of 32 488 samples across 39.2 million snps into a 7.4 gb database and decodes up to 420 million genotypes per cpu second. the high performance enables real-time responses to complex queries. availability and implementation: https://github.com/lh3/bgt contact: hengli@broadinstitute.orgvcf/bcf is the primary format for storing and analyzing genotypes of multiple samples. it however has a few issues. first, vcf is a site-oriented format. although accessing a site and all the associated genotypes is efficient with indexing, retrieving site annotations or the genotypes of a few samples always requires to decode the genotypes of all samples, which is unnecessarily expensive. second, vcf does not take advantage of linkage disequilibrium (ld), while using this information can dramatically improve compression ratio . third, a vcf record is not clearly defined. each record may consist of multiple alleles with each allele composed of multiple snps and indels. this ambiguity complicates annotations, query of alleles and integration of multiple datasets. at last, most existing vcf-based tools do not support expressive data query. we frequently need to write scripts for advanced queries, which costs both development and processing time. gqt attempts to solve some of these issues. although it is very fast for selecting a subset of samples and for traversing all sites, it discards phasing, is inefficient for region query and is not compressed well. the observations of these limitations motivated us to develop bgt.
