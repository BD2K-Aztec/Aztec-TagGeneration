genome analysis gsearch: a fast and flexible general search tool for whole-genome sequencing background: various processes such as annotation and filtering of variants or comparison of variants in different genomes are required in whole-genome or exome analysis pipelines. however, processing different databases and searching among millions of genomic loci is not trivial.recent technological advances in next-generation sequencing have made it possible to sequence whole genomes at unprecedented speeds and low costs . one of the crucial goals of whole-genome sequencing (wgs) is to seek a small number of variants related to a phenotype. to this end, millions of variants are heuristically filtered according to allele frequencies, conservation, gene models and predicted impact on protein function as described in. there exist several tools for such analysis . additionally, selected variants can be analyzed further or visualized for biological or clinical insights . even though many annotation and filtering methods for wgs to whom correspondence should be addressed. have been proposed, challenges still remain, such as processing sequence variants from many genomes and working with customized reference data. current methods require a significant amount of time for processing one genome and are hardly scalable to thousands of genomes. additionally, many tools adopt their own data formats and the use of customized annotation data is supported in a limited way. we address these issues by providing a search tool that enables flexible annotation and filtering of wgs data from an individual in seconds on normal desktop computers. to this end, we focus on locus comparison, as it is the root functionality of any annotation or filtering tool. furthermore, locus comparison can be utilized for other tasks, e.g. finding de novo mutation from a family dataset. we developed efficient algorithms for searching variants against a large dataset and implemented multi-threaded versions of them using the c language. it should be noted that our tool is not bound to a specific set of annotation databases. instead, it facilitates the use of custom and public reference files from ucsc, ncbi and ensembl by supporting a wide range of formats for genome annotation.we compared the performance and accuracy of our method with the region-based and filter-based functionalities of annovar (version march 8, 2012) using the dataset of 52 million variants from the known variants (kaviar) . the kaviar files (hg18 and hg19) were converted to gvf format for gsearch and to the standard input format for annovar. each query file (hg18 or hg19) contained 52 million variants. all analyses were performed on a desktop pc equipped with an intel core i5 processor (4 cores at 2.66 ghz) and 4 gb of ram. to compare exact search, the hg19 kaviar variant file was annotated with allele frequencies from the 1000 genomes project (ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/release/20110 521/) that covered over 39 millions of loci. gsearch was run in its exact search mode and annovar was run in its filter-based mode. gsearch completed the annotation process in 347 s while annovar took 4001 s. the annotation results from both tools were the same. to compare range search, the hg 18 kaviar variant file was annotated with their overlap with 3.8 million tfbss prepared with the tfbsconssites table from the ucsc table browser. annovar was run in its region-based mode and gsearch was run in its range search mode. it took 148 s for gsearch to annotate the query file, whereas annovar took 1276 s. two methods produced exactly the same result. although a majority of previously published wgs analysis tools include novel data formats in their pipelines, our proposed method can be used with diverse annotation resources in standard genome annotation file formats. with notable improvements in search speed and flexibility for multiple annotation file formats, gsearch can be used as a stand-alone genomic search tool or integrated into existing analysis pipelines. using gsearch, users can expeditiously annotate and filter variants in many genomes with various resources on their desktop computers.
