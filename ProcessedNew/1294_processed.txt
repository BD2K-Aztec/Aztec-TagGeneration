decoyfinder: an easy-to-use python gui application for building target-specific decoy sets decoys are molecules that are presumed to be inactive against a target (i.e. will not likely bind to the target) and are used to validate the performance of molecular docking or a virtual screening workflow. the directory of useful decoys database (http:// dud.docking.org/) provides a free directory of decoys for use in virtual screening, though it only contains a limited set of decoys for 40 targets.to overcome this limitation, we have developed an application called decoyfinder that selects, for a given collection of active ligands of a target, a set of decoys from a database of compounds. decoys are selected if they are similar to active ligands according to five physical descriptors (molecular weight, number of rotational bonds, total hydrogen bond donors, total hydrogen bond acceptors and the octanolwater partition coefficient) without being chemically similar to any of the active ligands used as an input (according to the tanimoto coefficient between maccs fingerprints). to the best of our knowledge, decoyfinder is the first application designed to build target-specific decoy sets.ligand enrichment is a key metric for assessing the performance of molecular docking or virtual screening workflows. it involves measuring the ability of a method or procedure to discriminate between active and inactive compounds. however, sufficient amounts of inactive compounds are generally not available for such testing; thus, decoys (i.e. molecules that are presumed to be inactive against the examined target) are commonly used for this purpose . to avoid bias and to ensure that the enrichment is not simply due to physical differences between active
