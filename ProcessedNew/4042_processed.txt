gene expression rnaseqgui: a gui for analysing rna-seq data we present rnaseqgui r package, a graphical user interface (gui) for the identification of differentially expressed genes across multiple biological conditions. this r package includes some well-known rna-seq tools, available at www.bioconductor.org. rnaseqgui package is not just a collection of some known methods and functions, but it is designed to guide the user during the entire analysis process. rnaseqgui package is mainly addressed to those users who have little experience with command-line software. therefore, thanks to rnaseqgui, they can conduct analogous analyses using this simple graphical interface. moreover, rnaseqgui is also helpful for those who are expert r-users because it speeds up the usage of the included rnaseq methods drastically. availability and implementation: rnaseqgui package needs the rgtk2 graphical library to run.there is a plethora of rna-seq data analysis tools available to study the difference of the gene expression across multiple biological conditions; see soneson and delorenzi (2013) for a review. generally, a complete analysis requires carrying out several steps, using different methods and comparing their outputs to obtain more reliable and less biased results. rnaseqgui is a tool that facilitates and speeds up the exploration of the rnaseq data, the usage of several rna-seq methods and the comparison of different results. moreover, rnaseqgui is a modular software. this gives the user the possibility to customize the software for a specific type of study.
