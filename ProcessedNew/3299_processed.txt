nsimscan: dna comparison tool with increased speed, sensitivity and accuracy nucleotide similarity scanner (nsimscan) is specialized for searching massive dna databases for distant similarities. its targeted applications include phylogenomics, comparative and functional studies of non-coding sequences, contamination detection, etc. nsimscan outper-forms industry standard tools in combined sensitivity, accuracy and speed, operating at sensitivity similar to blast, accuracy of ssearch and speed of megablast. availability and implementation: nsimscan is available at https://github.com/abadona/qsimscan as a part of qsimscan package. it is implemented in c , distributed under mit license and supported on linux, os x and windows (with cygwin).the breakthrough in sequencing technologies has brought the challenges of dna comparison to a new level. driven mainly by clinical applications, efficient tools for ngs reads mapping have been developed, however, the search for more distant similarities is still handled by sensitive but slower pre-ngs tools, or by modern algorithms that provide higher speed at the expense of sensitivity. we present nsimscan, a tool for fast, sensitive and accurate dna similarity search, and demonstrate its performance comparison to industry-standard alignment search tools. nsimscan was recently successfully employed for ani computing in a large phylogenetic study , and we believe that it will be useful for a variety of applications where efficient detection of distant similarities is desired.
