systems biology phylopro: a web-based tool for the generation and visualization of phylogenetic profiles across eukarya with increasing numbers of eukaryotic genome sequences, phylogenetic profiles of eukaryotic genes are becoming increasingly informative. here, we introduce a new web-tool phylopro (http://compsysbio.org/phylopro/), which uses the 120 available eukaryotic genome sequences to visualize the evolutionary trajectories of user-defined subsets of model organism genes. applied to pathways or complexes, phylopro allows the user to rapidly identify core conserved elements of biological processes together with those that may represent lineage-specific innovations. phylopro thus provides a valuable resource for the evolutionary and comparative studies of biological systems.
