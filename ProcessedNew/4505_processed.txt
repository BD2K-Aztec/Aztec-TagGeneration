genetics and population analysis synbreed: a framework for the analysis of genomic prediction data using r we present a novel r package named synbreed to derive genome-based predictions from high-throughput genotyping and large-scale phenotyping data. the package contains a comprehensive collection of functions required to fit and cross-validate genomic prediction models. all functions are embedded within the framework of a single, unified data object. thereby a versatile genomic prediction analysis pipeline covering data processing, visualization and analysis is established within one software package. the implementation is flexible with respect to a wide range of data formats and models. the package fills an existing gap in the availability of user-friendly software for next-generation genetics research and education. availability: synbreed is open-source and available through cran http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/synbreed. the latest development version is available from r-forge. the package synbreed is released with a vignette, a manual and three large-scale example datasets (from package synbreeddata).in the plant breeding community, there is a strong demand for a standard software covering a wide range of analysis steps. the package synbreed offers a comprehensive collection of methods required in the analysis of genomic prediction data. this is a step towards automatized analysis pipelines in the analysis of nextgeneration genotype and phenotype data which are required to bring genomic prediction from theory to practice. moreover, synbreed is a valuable tool for the education of young scientists and breeders.
