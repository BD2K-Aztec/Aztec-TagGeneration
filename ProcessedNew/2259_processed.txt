genome analysis ibag: integrative bayesian analysis of high-dimensional multiplatform genomics data motivation: analyzing data from multi-platform genomics experiments combined with patients clinical outcomes helps us understand the complex biological processes that characterize a disease, as well as how these processes relate to the development of the disease. current data integration approaches are limited in that they do not consider the fundamental biological relationships that exist among the data obtained from different platforms. statistical model: we propose an integrative bayesian analysis of genomics data (ibag) framework for identifying important genes/ biomarkers that are associated with clinical outcome. this framework uses hierarchical modeling to combine the data obtained from multiple platforms into one model. results: we assess the performance of our methods using several synthetic and real examples. simulations show our integrative methods to have higher power to detect disease-related genes than non-integrative methods. using the cancer genome atlas glioblast-oma dataset, we apply the ibag model to integrate gene expression and methylation data to study their associations with patient survival. our proposed method discovers multiple methylation-regulated genes that are related to patient survival, most of which have important biological functions in other diseases but have not been previously studied in glioblastoma.the overarching goal of cancer genomics is to customize patient care decisions according to diverse genetic and epigenetic alterations for a tumor . early cancer genomics studies focused on only a single type of alteration at a time to assess these changes, e.g. high-resolution copy number profiling led to the discovery of novel oncogenes in ovarian cancer , melanoma and lung carcinoma . some of these findings have already been translated into personalized cancer treatment, such as imatinib for kit-mutated gastrointestinal stromal tumors and trastuzumab for her2-positive breast tumors . as technologies to perform comprehensive profiling of the cancer genome have progressed, different technology platforms, from basic capillary electrophoresis sequencing to advanced forms of microarrays, have been brought together on the same patient set. for example, the cancer genome atlas (tcga) is a worldwide research program that currently encompasses comprehensive genomic datasets for 420 types of cancer (http://cancergemone.nih.gov;). the work of tcga is motivating approaches for integrating data outputs from different types of technology platforms to identify important biomarkers related to cancer development and progression. the key hypothesis behind these approaches is that cancer consists of hundreds of distinct molecular changes, from multiple types of genetic and epigenetic alterations to the interactions among them. each type of alteration provides a different and complementary view of the whole genome. hence, integrating multiple aspects of the genome and the underlying biological processes to identify novel targets is essential and has the potential to improve the clinical management of cancer. the concept of integration is very broad (see review by). such integration studies can be divided into three general groups according to the primary focus of the study . the focus of the first group, called sequential integration studies, is the sequential analysis of heterogeneous data from different platforms for the purpose of understanding the biological evolution of disease as opposed to predicting clinical outcome . in this group, data obtained on one type of platform are analyzed along with the clinical outcome data, and then a second data platform is subsequently used to clarify or confirm the results obtained from the first platform. for example,showed that microrna expression can be used to sort tumors from normal tissues, regardless of tumor type. the study then analyzed the relationship between the candidate target genes for the cancer-related micrornas and mrna expression and disease status. the focus of the second group of integration studies, which we call biological integration studies, is the analysis of biological pathways and regulatory mechanisms among data to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2012. published by oxford university press. all

platforms, such as the relationship between gene expression and protein abundances, or the relationship between gene expression and copy number changes in patient tumor samples . the challenge for this group of studies is that the biological annotation databases used for mapping different datasets are inconsistent. an r-package to match array comparative genomic hybridization (cgh) and gene expression microarray features for integrative analysis purposes was provided by van. the focus of the third group of integration studies, which we term model-based integration studies, is the analysis of data obtained from multiple platforms that are combined into one statistical model to identify clinically relevant genes and/or to predict clinical outcome. instead of merging datasets or analyzing them sequentially, the data from different platforms are treated equally, and the most relevant features are selected from all available platforms . for example,proposed a kernel-based approach to integrate data from multiple platforms for the classification of discrete clinical outcomes. they showed that the area under curve (auc) based on integrated data used for predictions was significantly improved compared with the auc based on data from a single platform. however, these studies treated each platform independently and ignored the underlying biological mechanisms among different platforms. witten and tibshirani (2009) developed a supervised canonical correlation model to find significant axes of correlations between multiple multivariate datasets at a global (chromosomal) level. they integrated copy number and gene expression data and identified linear combinations (canonical variables) that are related to a clinical outcome. however, they also did not take the biological mechanisms (directionality) into account, as we detail later in the text. our proposed method takes a different approach in modeling biological relationships among molecular features measured by different platforms, by focusing on relationships at a genecentric level. we first study the underlying biological mechanisms, relating the data across the different platforms. then using this information, we partition gene expression into different (independent) units and use this to identify genes relevant to clinical outcome as modulated by these different platforms. we hypothesize (and show) that, compared with non-integrative methods, our proposed method can detect clinically relevant gene expression changes with greater power and a lower false discovery rate (fdr), in addition to obtaining results that are more biologically interpretable. molecular biology has shown that features identified on different platforms influence clinical outcome at different levels. for example, in tcga studies, copy number, methylation, mutation status, mrna expression, microrna expression and the expression of proteins in specific signaling pathways have been measured on the same set of samples. the fundamental biological relationships among the products of these different platforms and their associations with clinical outcome are shown in. generally speaking, molecular features measured at the transcript level (e.g. mrna expression) affect clinical outcome more directly than molecular features measured at the dna/epigenetics level (e.g. copy number, methylation and mutation status). molecular features measured at the dna level affect clinical outcome by influencing mrna expression . similarly, micrornas, post-transcriptional regulators that bind to complementary sequences on target mrnas, influence mrna through translational repression or target degradation, which then affects clinical outcome . conducting the proposed integrative analysis is a challenge because of the complicated biological relationships and the different intrinsic structures of various platforms. for example, molecular features measured at the dna level regulate the mrna expressions of the corresponding genes or nearby genes . in contrast, micrornas can regulate the mrna expression of any gene, regardless of its locus, and each microrna molecule has multiple target genes. another challenge underlying this analysis is the large scale of the different types of gene alterations in contrast to the limited number of patient samples for such a study. hence, an easily implemented and efficient variable selection method is needed for such an integration analysis. we have developed the integrative bayesian analysis of genomics data (ibag) model to address these challenges. the main advantages of our proposed model can be summarized as follows. the ibag model (i) uses a hierarchical approach to model the fundamental biological relationships underlying molecular features obtained by different platforms; (ii) accounts for both the influences of different platforms and the biological relationships among the platforms in one unified model to predict patients clinical outcomes; (iii) can conduct high-dimensional variable selection, which adapts to analyzing hundreds of distinct molecular entity effects jointly in one model; (iv) uses a bayesian framework, which allows the model enough flexibility to estimate the different intrinsic structures of biological relationships for different high-throughput platforms; and (v) is computationally efficient and feasible owing to its closed forms of full conditional posterior distributions for posterior sampling. the rest of this article is organized as follows. in section 2, we describe the ibag model construction along with prior formulations for continuous, discrete and survival clinical outcomes. in section 3, we introduce an innovative approach for conducting high-dimensional variable selection using bayesian fdrs. in section 4, we illustrate the performance of the ibag model and use simulations to compare its performance with those of alternative approaches. in section 5, we apply the ibag model to integrate gene expression and methylation data for tcgas glioblastoma study, and evaluate the associationsbetween those data and patients survival times. finally, we provide a summary and discussion in section 6. the technical details and additional simulation results are contained in the supplementary material (section s1).in this article, we introduce an innovative model, ibag, to integrate two different platforms of omics data and estimate their associations with clinical outcome. different from most existing integration approaches, which focus on either finding biological relationships among different platforms or predicting patient prognosis, our ibag model involves a hierarchical structure, which simultaneously estimates biological mechanisms and uses this information to find significant prognostic genes. our simulation study shows that the ibag model can simultaneously increase the power and decrease the fdr in detecting clinically relevant genes, especially for genes with expression effects modulated only by methylation. moreover, we can categorize all clinically relevant genes into three groups according to different biological mechanisms: genes with expression effects modulated only by methylation, genes with expression effects modulated only by other mechanisms and genes with expression effects modulated by both methylation and other mechanisms. we apply the ibag model to integrate methylation data and gene expression data from tcgas gbm dataset. the results show that the ibag model outperforms the model based on data from a single layer of biological information in both determining genes important to survival and model fitting. the main goal of the ibag model is to (i) identify more disease-associated genes, and (ii) achieve better predictive power, by treating gene expression as the downstream event that is regulated by different mechanisms (e.g. methylation, copy number and microrna). we choose to treat the gene expression as a downstream event regulated by different mechanisms so that the ibag model can help us identify more disease-associated genes. there are several reasons underlying this choice. first, acknowledging that a genes expression can be modulated by different mechanisms (e.g. methylation, copy number and microrna), even if these mechanisms do not have a direct effect on survival, we can still identify genes whose modulated expressions potentially impact survival. second, as the measure of gene expression from microarray technology is usually noisy, ibag can effectively identify, which part of the gene expression is actually modulated by various factors from other platforms, thus denoising the expression to find prognostic genes. in addition, as shown by our analysis of the gbm data, if we simply use methylation information additively to gene expression to estimate the methylation effects on patient survival, we find that many methylation effects related to survival do not significantly change the gene expression levels. the ibag model can help us eliminate these genes and obtain results that are more biologically interpretable. as our main goal is to identify important genes associated with patient survival, we assume that the methylation effect on gene. genes with significant gene expression effects obtained by ibag unified model
