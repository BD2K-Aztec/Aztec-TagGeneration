gene expression msnbase-an r/bioconductor package for isobaric tagged mass spectrometry data visualization, processing and quantitation msnbase is an r/bioconductor package for the analysis of quantitative proteomics experiments that use isobaric tagging. it provides an exploratory data analysis framework for reproducible research, allowing raw data import, quality control, visualization, data processing and quantitation. msnbase allows direct integration of quantitative proteomics data with additional facilities for statistical analysis provided by the bioconductor project. availability: msnbase is implemented in r (version 2.13.0) and available at the bioconductor web site (http://www.bioconductor .org/). vignettes outlining typical workflows, input/output capabilities and detailing underlying infrastructure are included in the package.proteomics, the analysis of the entire protein complement expressed by a genome, has recently benefited from substantial technological advances . among the numerous approaches to interrogate proteomes, a popular technique is the quantitation of samples using isobaric tags. nevertheless, high-throughput proteomics lags behind genomics, genetics or transcriptomics in terms of reproducible data analysis and development of analytical stategies. one of the challenges within proteomics is the availability of open, extensible and efficient data mining and statistical assessment environments . here, we introduce the msnbase package, part of the bioconductor project . msnbase extends bioconductor with tools and data structures to import raw tandem mass spectrometry (ms2) data, perform exploratory data analysis and quantification of isobaric reporter tags. the infrastructure is compatible with existing bioconductor core packages, incorporating available features and allowing direct utilization of additional functionality.
