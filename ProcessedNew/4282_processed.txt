structural bioinformatics skink: a web server for string kernel based kink prediction in-helices motivation: the reasons for distortions from optimal-helical geometry are widely unknown, but their influences on structural changes of proteins are significant. hence, their prediction is a crucial problem in structural bioinformatics. here, we present a new web server, called skink, for string kernel based kink prediction. extending our previous study, we also annotate the most probable kink position in a given-helix sequence. availability and implementation: the skink web server is freely accessible at http://biows-inf.zdv.uni-mainz.de/skink. moreover, skink is a module of the ball software, also freely available at www.ballin our previous study , we presented a new method for predicting kinks from amino acid sequences of-helices implemented in the biochemical algorithm library (ball;). using string kernel based support vector machines (svm), we were able to predict kinks in $80 of all cases correctly, exceeding recently reported accuracies of alternative approaches . to make our approach publicly available by providing a user-friendly interface, we developed the web server skink. moreover, we annotate the most probable kink position and calculate the corresponding probability value described shortly in the section 2. in consequence, the region around the identified residue can be treated as flexible, e.g. in molecular dynamics (md) simulations, while the remainder of the helix can be restrained.
