gene expression spotxplore: a cytoscape plugin for visual exploration of hotspot expression in gene regulatory networks spotxplore is a plugin for cytoscape for extraction and visualization of differentially expressed subnetworks (hotspots) from gene networks. the hotspot-based visualization approach enables interactive exploration of regulatory interactions in differentially expressed gene sets, and it allows a researcher to explore gene expression in direct relation to the affected cellular gene network. the hotspots provide a view beyond the commonly used metabolic pathways and gene ontologies.interpretation of gene expression from time series experiments or multiple perturbation studies is a challenging task. insight can be obtained by analyzing the data in the context of molecular interaction networks, such as gene regulatory networks or metabolic pathways, which requires visualization in addition to statistical analysis tools. many tools for visualizing the various types of biological networks have been developed . nevertheless, there is a need for tools that incorporate dynamics of gene expression in the networks by offering both data analysis and visualization. only then, a researcher does not have to switch between various applications to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the biological processes affected in the experiments. the generic biological network visualization tool cytoscape provides an excellent environment to implement combined analysis and visualization methods. in this article, we present spotxplore, a plugin for analysis and visual exploration of differentially expressed subnetworks (hotspots). spotxplore provides two methods to detect such hotspots, and allows the user to visualize the hotspots in the context of the whole network to explore regulatory interactions between differentially
