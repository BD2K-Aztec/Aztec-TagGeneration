genome analysis m 3 d: a kernel-based test for spatially correlated changes in methylation profiles motivation: dna methylation is an intensely studied epigenetic mark implicated in many biological processes of direct clinical relevance. although sequencing-based technologies are increasingly allowing high-resolution measurements of dna methylation, statistical modelling of such data is still challenging. in particular, statistical identification of differentially methylated regions across different conditions poses unresolved challenges in accounting for spatial correlations within the statistical testing procedure. results: we propose a non-parametric, kernel-based method, m 3 d, to detect higher order changes in methylation profiles, such as shape, across pre-defined regions. the test statistic explicitly accounts for differences in coverage levels between samples, thus handling in a principled way a major confounder in the analysis of methylation data. empirical tests on real and simulated data-sets show an increased power compared to established methods, as well as considerable robust-ness with respect to coverage and replication levels. availability and implementation: r/bioconductordna methylation is an epigenetic mark associated with many fundamental biological processes of direct clinical relevance, such as imprinting, retrotransposon silencing and cell differentiation . methylation occurs when a methyl group is attached to a cytosine. in mammals, methylation is observed predominantly in the cpg context, and, consequently, studies tend to focus on these loci. the canonical understanding is that methylation of cpg regions in promoter regions (cgis) is associated with gene silencing; however, recent studies have shown that cpg methylation correlates with gene expression in a more complex and context-dependent manner . methylation profiles are altered in many diseases, most notably cancer , and as such epigenetic therapies are being developed, which specifically target methylation . bisulfite treatment of dna followed by next-generation sequencing provides quantitative methylation data with base pair resolution. unmethylated cytosines are deaminated into uracils, which amplify as thymines during pcr . reads are then aligned to a reference genome, permitting changes of c to t. the resulting counts of cytosine and thymine at registered cytosine loci form the basis of further analysis. this general procedure has been adapted in various ways, with reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (rrbs) being one of the most widely used. rrbs involves using a restriction enzyme such as mspi (or taqi) to cleave the dna at ccgg (or tcga) loci and selecting short reads for sequencing . this results in greater coverage of cpg dense regions at lower cost. several methods have been proposed to statistically test for differentially methylated region (dmrs). almost all these methods perform a search for dmrs by testing individual cytosines followed by v c the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license

widely used methods, performs local likelihood smoothing to generate methylation profiles for each sample, before testing individual locations in the profiles to identify dmcs. more recent methods, such as biseq and methylsig , also employ local smoothing, together with a beta-binomial model of methylation at individual cytosines; both of these methods then aggregate the results of tests at individual loci to compute a measure of significance for dmrs. the beta-binomial method models biological variability at each cytosine location and hence requires a high replication level to achieve power. coverage can also be problematic, as low coverage precludes statistical significance and high coverage can lead to over-confidence in calling dmrs, although the latter effect can be ameliorated by having a larger number of replicates. for instance, methylsig requires a minimum of three replicates per group and ignores loci which are covered by fewer than 10 reads by default. a recent method, magi , takes a different approach by testing directly for dmrs, rather than computing regionwide measures of significance from tests of individual cytosines. magi assumes the availability of genome-wide decision boundary methylation levels (which can be determined either from annotation or in a data-driven fashion). methylation levels at each cytosine are then given a binary representation based on whether they exceed the decision boundary, and a single fet is performed over each region by counting how many cytosines have changed state. although these methods can be highly effective, no current method explicitly accounts for spatial covariation (magi implicitly assumes spatial homogeneity across a region). dna methylation levels are often strongly spatially correlated: accounting for such correlations in a testing procedure could then lead to considerable increases in statistical power. some examples of spatially correlated changes in the encode data analysed in section 3.2 are shown inand supplementary; notice that in all these examples, the change at individual cytosines is modest, and hence these regions would not be called as dmrs by currently existing methods. we remark that, although local smoothing methods like bsmooth attempt to capture spatial coherence, the local coherence is not an integral part of the testing procedure. smoothing in this setting serves the dual purposes of filtering noise and highlighting large-scale changes in the methylation profile. moreover, the shape of the methylation profile has been suggested as an important factor in predicting gene expression , leading to a potentially functional role for methylation patterns. to our knowledge, there are no methods that test higher order properties, such as shape, of the methylation profiles over a region. here, we present maximum mean methylation discrepancy (m 3 d), a non-parametric statistical test for identifying dmrs from pre-defined regions, explicitly accounting for shape changes in methylation profiles. our method is based on the maximum mean discrepancy (mmd), a recent technique from the machine learning literature, which tests whether two samples have been generated from the same probability distribution . similar non-parametric tests have already been applied to chip-seq and rna-seq data . our contribution is to adapt the method for the specific challenges of bisulfite sequencing data, introducing an explicit control for confounding changes in coverage levels. our method is used to test for changes in methylation profiles across regions, as opposed to individual cytosines, and we call as dmrs those regions whose variation cannot be explained by inter-replicate variability. we demonstrate the performance of m 3 d against existing methods on real and simulated data, showing a considerable increase in power and improved robustness against reduced replication and coverage levels.we proposed the first kernel-based test for dmrs which exploits higher order spatial features of methylation profiles. empirical comparisons on simulated and real data show a considerable increase in statistical power in comparison with the widely used bsmooth method , as well as considerable robustness to low coverage and low replication. the m 3 d method also outperforms magi in our simulations, as well as calling more dmrs in the real dataset, though this comes at a computational cost. the increased power of the m 3 d approach is due to a number of factors. firstly, the method is sensitive to spatially correlated changes in methylation profiles. methylation profiles are known to be highly spatially correlated in general, and the results of our experiments imply that spatial correlation is also a feature of differences in methylation profiles between conditions, at least in the datasets considered. secondly, the method explicitly accounts for differences in the coverage profiles between conditions, a confounding factor for other methods, as demonstrated in. thirdly, the method models inter-replicate variability on a regional basis along the whole genome. each regional cross-group methylation change is compared with this distribution, and test statistics for each region represent how well the change in methylation profiles can be explained by inter-replicate variability. at present, other methods that consider inter-replicate variability do so on a cpg site-by-site basis, which lacks power with low replication and coverage and does not consider regional, spatial changes. when testing the method with different strengths of methylation change at cpg loci, we saw a sharp decrease in the number of regions being called as the methylation profile change over the regions became comparable to inter-replicate variability. other methods experienced a less pronounced change in this regard. other studies have suggested that changes in shape of methylation profiles are important in predicting gene expression . to test whether our method is able to capture functionally important changes in methylation profiles, we performed gene expression analysis with human data and showed a link between methylation changes called by the m 3 d method and gene expression changes between conditions. further, the results support the hypothesis that gene expression is more closely linked to methylation in the first exon of a gene than to methylation in promoter regions . go analysis of first exon and whole gene methylation changes both revealed links to cell function, despite none of the exons overlapping the gene regions, a result that was not apparent for promoter methylation changes. although our findings confirm a potential role for methylation profile shape as a predictor of gene expression, they do not provide biological mechanisms for linking methylation shape to gene expression and regulation. although sequence variants and protein binding have been shown to be predictive of epigenetic variability , we believe that further investigation of the mechanistic underpinnings of changes in methylation shape could be a valuable direction for research. the m 3 d method provides a considerable increase in power over existing methods, yet it comes at the cost of computational intensity. in this study, we have restricted comparisons to datasets of low replication, as beta-binomial methods should prove effective with higher replication. we have also focused on sub-megabase scale changes for two reasons. firstly, such an analysis is likely to be exploratory, in the sense that testing regions are not pre-defined, a key. venn diagram of calls with reduced coverage. three-hundred eightytwo calls are consistent at all coverage levels. the method misses clusters at lower coverage levels, yet it does not call many dmrs that were not identified at higher coverage levels. venn diagram of calls with fewer replicates, for the case of four, three and two replicates for esc cell control group requirement for our method, and secondly, because bsmooth has proved adept at identifying large-scale changes in this setting and is computationally cheaper. the m 3 d framework was developed with rrbs data in mind, yet, given its robustness to lower coverage, we expect that it may also be well suited for wgbs data. in the future, it will be interesting to develop models that explain the predictive power of methylation profiles in terms of other epigenetic marks.
