genome analysis a comparative analysis of algorithms for somatic snv detection in cancer motivation: with the advent of relatively affordable high-throughput technologies, dna sequencing of cancers is now common practice in cancer research projects and will be increasingly used in clinical practice to inform diagnosis and treatment. somatic (cancer-only) single nucleotide variants (snvs) are the simplest class of mutation, yet their identification in dna sequencing data is confounded by germline poly-morphisms, tumour heterogeneity and sequencing and analysis errors. four recently published algorithms for the detection of somatic snv sites in matched cancernormal sequencing datasets are varscan, somaticsniper, jointsnvmix and strelka. in this analysis, we apply these four snv calling algorithms to cancernormal illumina exome sequencing of a chronic myeloid leukaemia (cml) patient. the candidate snv sites returned by each algorithm are filtered to remove likely false positives, then characterized and compared to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of each snv calling algorithm. results: comparing the candidate snv sets returned by varscan, somaticsniper, jointsnvmix2 and strelka revealed substantial differences with respect to the number and character of sites returned; the somatic probability scores assigned to the same sites; their susceptibility to various sources of noise; and their sensitivities to low-allelic-fraction candidates. availability: data accession number sra081939, code atcancer genome projects are currently working to catalogue the diversity of dna mutations present in different cancers via highthroughput dna sequencing of matched cancernormal samples. these projects seek to find correlations between mutation profiles and clinical outcomes, identify mutations driving cancer progression and identify targets for novel therapeutic developments. somatic single nucleotide variants (snvs) are the simplest class of mutation, but their detection from matched cancer normal sequencing data is complicated by both biological and technical noise. cancers arise from a single ancestral cell that has acquired enough somatic mutations to deregulate its own proliferation and expand into a large cell population with clonal mutations matching the ancestral profile. loss of function in genes for genome stability and repair establishes a mutator phenotype in which a greater rate of somatic mutation provides the cell population with a vast repository of mutations in low copy. those mutations conferring a selective advantage preferentially expand in number, forming subpopulations with the same subclonal mutations. clonal and subclonal mutations include drivers of the cancer phenotype, and passenger mutations that arose in the same clonally expanding cell line as a driver . analysis of cancer sequencing data has unique challenges, including: methods for analysing matched cancernormal samples to distinguish germline polymorphism from somatic variation; genome rearrangements that do not align well to the reference; and cancer sample heterogeneity from subclonal variation and sample impurity . in addition to this biological complexity are several sources of mapping and sequencing error, both random and systematic. error profile assessments of the illumina sequencing platform have identified increased error rates at read ends, a tendency towards transversion base-call errors, a low indel error rate and systematic sequence-specific errors following inverted repeat sequences and gg motifs . the majority of systematic errors assessed byonly had base-call errors on one of the two dna strands. they suggested the presence of different motifs immediately preceding a certain site during sequencing on different strands leaves one strand significantly more prone to phasing error than the other. greater depth of sequencing is often advanced as the solution to separating sequencing errors from real variation, but the susceptibility of particular sites to recurrent base-call errors is consistently observed at any depth. furthermore, increased depth has the unintended side effect of allowing sites with lower susceptibility to systematic error to accumulate multiple such mistakes. this is to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2013. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. a particularly significant problem in cancer sequencing, as subclonal variation and sample impurity give rise to mutations at the same low allelic fractions as aggregations of systematic error.varscan2, somaticsniper, jsm2 and strelka were used to return candidate snv sites from matched cancernormal exomes from a chronic myeloid leukaemia (cml) patient, sequenced with the illumina hiseq platform in paired 100 bp reads (sra081939). the algorithms were also applied to similar exome sequencing data from non-cancerous patient samples (randomly split into two equal-sized subsamples to mimic production of two normal sequencing samples from each individual) to assess the output returned in the absence of any real somatic variation between samples. details of the data and methods used are available in the supplementary information.
