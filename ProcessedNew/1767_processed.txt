faster sequence homology searches by clustering subsequences motivation: sequence homology searches are used in various fields. new sequencing technologies produce huge amounts of sequence data, which continuously increase the size of sequence databases. as a result, homology searches require large amounts of computational time, especially for metagenomic analysis. results: we developed a fast homology search method based on database subsequence clustering , and implemented it as ghostz. this method clusters similar subsequences from a database to perform an efficient seed search and ungapped extension by reducing alignment candidates based on triangle inequality. the database subsequence clustering technique achieved an $2-fold increase in speed without a large decrease in search sensitivity. when we measured with metage-nomic data, ghostz is $2.22.8 times faster than rapsearch and is $185261 times faster than blastx. availability and implementation: the source code is freely available for download atdna sequencing technologies have improved rapidly. the hiseq2500 can produce several hundred billion base pairs (bp) of sequence data in a single run and its throughput is 10 000 times higher than that of old-generation sequencers. most sequencers produce information in short fragments (reads) that range in length from 100 to 1000 bp. thus, it is necessary to determine the location of each read in a genome, to use known biological information even when a reference genome is available. this process is called mapping, and many effective mapping programs, such as bwa and bowtie , have been developed for this purpose. in metagenomic analysis, environmental samples frequently include dna sequences from many different species, and the reference database often does not contain closely related genome sequences. thus, more sensitive approaches are required to identify novel genes in these samples. in a typical metagenomic analysis, reads are translated into protein coding sequences and assigned to protein families by running homology searches against publicly available databases, such as cog and pfam . the blastx program is commonly used for such binning and classification searches. to identify homologs that may not have high nucleotide sequence identities, blastx translates nucleotide sequences into protein sequences, because protein sequences are often more similar than the original nucleotide sequences . however, the search speed of blastx has become insufficient for analysis of the large quantities of sequence data now available.in the evaluation experiment, ghostz achieved an 2-fold increase in speed, relative to ghostz without clustering. this acceleration can probably be attributed to the reduction in the number of ungapped extensions that were required when using ghostz. to validate this hypothesis, we compared the total number of ungapped extensions required by each method. in the database subsequence clustering approach, similarity filtering requires comparable computing time to the ungapped extension process; therefore, we added the number of similarity filterings performed to the number of ungapped extensions. we found that the number of ungapped extensions could be reduced to approximately one-third of the original number using database subsequence clustering. currently, ungapped extension is one of the primary bottlenecks in fast homology searches. thus, we think that this effective decrease in ungapped extensions contributed to the large acceleration we observed when using subsequence clustering for homology searches. cablastp, which is based on a compression approach, achieved 2.43.1-fold faster processing speed than the original blastp . the acceleration achieved by ghostz was 2-fold faster than the speed of ghostz without clustering, which is comparable to that of cablastp. however, we achieved a processing speed that was much faster than that of the blast homology search algorithm. as described earlier, the compression approach used in cablastp requires high search sensitivity and cannot be applied to faster, but less sensitive, homology search algorithms. in the initial processing, the compression search algorithm needs to find remote homologs in a coarse database, and less sensitive homology search algorithms often fail to find such sequences. in contrast, the clustering targets used in our approach are subsequences in a database, which does not depend on search sensitivity. in addition, ghostz uses hamming distance in database subsequence clustering to measure the dissimilarity between sequences, whereas cablastp uses sequence similarity. using distance allows search seeds to be pruned efficiently using triangle inequality in an ungapped extension process, contributing to the acceleration in processing. ghostz allows the indexes of a database to be constructed anew, so that users who wish to use other parameters can use thisnote: the first, second and third columns show the size of the database chunks, the memory required for constructing the index (gb) and the memory required for the homology search (gb), respectively. we searched the kegg genes (3.9 gb) database.note: the first, second and third columns show the size of the database chunks, the computation time and the acceleration in processing speed relative to ghostz, respectively, using 1 gb database chunks. we searched the kegg genes (3.9 gb) database.we developed a new homology search algorithm with subsequence clustering. we reduced the number of ungapped alignment extensions by clustering subsequences in a database, and achieved a 2-fold acceleration in processing speed without a drop in search sensitivity. the algorithm was designed for functional and taxonomic annotation in metagenome analysis. the proposed database subsequence clustering method could also be useful in proteome research, which requires a huge number of sequence homology searches.
