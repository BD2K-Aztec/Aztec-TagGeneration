genome analysis sushi.r: flexible, quantitative and integrative genomic visualizations for publication-quality multi-panel figures motivation: interpretation and communication of genomic data require flexible and quantitative tools to analyze and visualize diverse data types, and yet, a comprehensive tool to display all common gen-omic data types in publication quality figures does not exist to date. to address this shortcoming, we present sushi.r, an r/bioconductor package that allows flexible integration of genomic visualizations into highly customizable, publication-ready, multi-panel figures from common genomic data formats including browser extensible data (bed), bedgraph and browser extensible data paired-end (bedpe). sushi.r is open source and made publicly available through githubgenomic science is a rich data-intensive field in which diverse data types are combined to uncover and explore characteristics of sequence elements on a large scale. however, despite a growing set of mature standard visualization techniques and file formats, no comprehensive tools exist to facilitate multi-panel visualization across a broad range of standard genomic data types. to address this deficiency, we developed sushi.r, a flexible r library that leverages standard visualization techniques and file formats to produce highly customizable publicationquality figures of genomic data within the widespread analysis environment, r(r core).
