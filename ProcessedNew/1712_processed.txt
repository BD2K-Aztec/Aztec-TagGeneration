gene expression expressionviewâ€”an interactive viewer for modules identified in gene expression data expressionview is an r package that provides an interactive graphical environment to explore transcription modules identified in gene expression data. a sophisticated ordering algorithm is used to present the modules with the expression in a visually appealing layout that provides an intuitive summary of the results. from this overview, the user can select individual modules and access biologically relevant metadata associated with them.biclustering is an unsupervised data analysis method that is frequently used to explore microarray data. biclustering algorithms process collections of expression profiles to identify groups of genes co-expressed under some conditions (samples). we refer to such groups as modules. while there is a multitude of biclustering software available [for reviews and comparisons see (, packages with intuitive interfaces that allow for an interactive exploration of the results are sparse. existing approaches include bivisu and bicoverlapper . the former is an interactive biclustering program that plots modules individually, making it difficult to identify the relationship between the overlapping modules. the latter is a novel tool for plotting overlapping modules, yet in an abstract space. our approach in expressionview is different, as we use the usual gene-sample space and visualize all modules together, on top of the reordered expression matrix. the reordering ensures that the genes and samples that appear in the same module are kept together. to whom correspondence should be addressed. the authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first four authors should be regarded as joint first authors.
