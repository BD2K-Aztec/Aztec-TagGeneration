data and text mining harmonization of gene/protein annotations: towards a gold standard medline motivation: the recognition of named entities (ner) is an elementary task in biomedical text mining. a number of ner solutions have been proposed in recent years, taking advantage of available annotated corpora, terminological resources and machine-learning techniques. currently, the best performing solutions combine the outputs from selected annotation solutions measured against a single corpus. however, little effort has been spent on a systematic analysis of methods harmonizing the annotation results and measuring against a combination of gold standard corpora (gscs). results: we present totum, a machine learning solution that harmonizes gene/protein annotations provided by heterogeneous ner solutions. it has been optimized and measured against a combination of manually curated gscs. the performed experiments show that our approach improves the f-measure of state-of-the-art solutions by up to 10 (achieving 70) in exact alignment and 22 (achieving 82) in nested alignment. we demonstrate that our solution delivers reliable annotation results across the gscs and it is an important contribution towards a homogeneous annotation of medline abstracts. availability and implementation: totum is implemented in java and its resources are available atin the last decades, we have witnessed an explosion of publicly available data, a consequence of the deep integration of computerized solutions in society. this rapid growth was also observed in biomedicine, with an overwhelming amount of data resulting from high-throughput methods, accompanied by a corresponding increase of textual information. for instance, medline contains over 18 million references to journal papers covering various biomedical fields (e.g. medicine and dentistry). medline and other biomedical resources are manually curated by expert annotators, in order to correctly identify biological entities (e.g. genes and proteins) and the relations between them (e.g. proteinprotein interactions) from texts. however, manual to whom correspondence should be addressed. annotation of large amounts of data has become a very demanding and expensive task. this situation naturally led to the development of computerized systems to perform these steps automatically. the goal of information extraction (ie) is to extract structured and unambiguous information from unstructured data (e.g. natural language texts). named entity recognition (ner) is a crucial initial task of biomedical ie, which intends to extract chunks of text that refer to specific entities of interest. it is one of the most important tasks, as the identified entities will be used as input to the following steps in the ie pipeline. however, gene and protein names have several characteristics that make difficult their identification in texts . @bullet many entity names are descriptive (e.g. normal thymic epithelial cells);@bullet two or more entity names sharing one head noun (e.g. 91 and 84 kda proteins refers to 91 kda protein and 84 kda protein);@bullet one entity name with several spelling forms (e.g. nacetylcysteine, n-acetyl-cysteine and nacetylcysteine);@bullet ambiguous abbreviations are frequently used (e.g. tcf may refer to t cell factor or to tissue culture fluid).various systems were developed using different approaches and techniques, which can be categorized as being based on rules, dictionaries or machine learning. however, the most recent results clearly indicate that better performance can be achieved by using an ensemble of ner systems. as an example, the top five systems of the biocreative ii gene mention challenge used ensembles of ner solutions. in these systems, each approach identifies entity mentions with different characteristics and based on different knowledge. moreover, most of the ner solutions are trained and/or tested in only one corpus, which is usually focused in a specific biomedical domain and provides specific gene/protein names and contexts. as a consequence, when the system is applied to a corpus from a different domain, the global performance drops significantly. although this occurs with machine learning approaches, it also affects dictionary-based solutions, depending on the specificity of the used lexical resource. this is not only a consequence of the different domains, but also a result of the different annotation guidelines and their interpretation by human annotators. for instance,in this article, we presented totum, a new cross-corpus solution to harmonize heterogeneous gene/protein names from several ner or normalization systems. this approach uses crfs to take advantage of the variability existent in several corpora from different domains,
