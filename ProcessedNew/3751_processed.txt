protein secondary structure appears to be robust under in silico evolution while protein disorder appears not to be motivation: the mutation of amino acids often impacts protein function and structure. mutations without negative effect sustain evolutionary pressure. we study a particular aspect of structural robustness with respect to mutations: regular protein secondary structure and natively unstructured (intrinsically disordered) regions. is the formation of regular secondary structure an intrinsic feature of amino acid sequences, or is it a feature that is lost upon mutation and is maintained by evolution against the odds? similarly, is disorder an intrinsic sequence feature or is it difficult to maintain? to tackle these questions, we in silico mutated native protein sequences into random sequence-like ensembles and monitored the change in predicted secondary structure and disorder. results: we established that by our coarse-grained measures for change, predictions and observations were similar, suggesting that our results were not biased by prediction mistakes. changes in secondary structure and disorder predictions were linearly proportional to the change in sequence. surprisingly, neither the content nor the length distribution for the predicted secondary structure changed substantially. regions with long disorder behaved differently in that significantly fewer such regions were predicted after a few mutation steps. our findings suggest that the formation of regular secondary structure is an intrinsic feature of random amino acid sequences, while the formation of long-disordered regions is not an intrinsic feature of proteins with disordered regions. put differently, helices and strands appear to be maintained easily by evolution, whereas maintaining disordered regions appears difficult. neutral mutations with respect to disorder are therefore very unlikely.random, undirected mutation is a major driving force for change in nature. in the protein universe, selection is realized through function: mutations leading to loss of function are rarely observed. as protein structure determines protein function, it is also subjected to evolutionary selection. most problematic single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp) that alter the amino acid sequence (nonsynonymous snps) appear to impact the stability of protein structure . helices and strands constitute the major macromolecular building blocks of all well-ordered proteins . the particular 3d structure of a protein is assumed to correspond to the global minimum free energy and hence defines the unique fold of an amino acid polymer . another essential feature of protein structure is the unique interplay between well-ordered and flexible regions . one particular aspect of this interplay is that between what we may loosely refer to as order and disorder . many proteins have regions that remain unstructured unless bound to a substrate: they do not adopt a unique stable conformation in isolation. such regions are also referred to as intrinsically disordered or simply as disordered. our operational definition for this vague term is: we consider as disorder whatever is predicted as such. proteins with long-disorder regions have unique biophysical traits that enable the binding to different substrates, often at different cellular conditions . very long regions without regular secondary structure (loosely referred to as loops) may resemble disorder ; nevertheless, we can clearly distinguish between disorder-like and well-structured loops . disorder is an important building block for the increase in complexity in the evolution from unicellular prokaryotes to multi-cellular eukaryotes.page: 626 625631
