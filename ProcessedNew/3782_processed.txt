psifr: an integrated resource for prediction of protein structure and function in the post-genomic era, the annotation of protein function facilitates the understanding of various biological processes. to extend the range of function annotation methods to the twilight zone of sequence identity, we have developed approaches that exploit both protein tertiary structure and/or protein sequence evolutionary relationships. to serve the scientific community, we have integrated the structure prediction tools, tasser, tasser-lite and metatasser, and the functional inference tools, findsite, a structure-based algorithm for binding site prediction, gene ontology molecular function inference and ligand screening, eficaz 2 , a sequence-based approach to enzyme function inference and dbd-hunter, an algorithm for predicting dna-binding proteins and associated dna-binding residues, into a unified web resource, protein structure and function prediction resource (psifr). availability and implementation: psifr is freely available for use on the web atover the past decade, the success of genome sequencing has produced a large number of gene products with unknown structure and function . the description of protein function ranges from its biochemical role to its role in determining phenotypical response . thus, the complete functional annotation of a protein is a time consuming process that involves data curation from both computational and experimental studies . most computational function annotation tools use protein sequences to detect evolutionary relationships between proteins of unknown and known function that provide functional clues for 4060 of the gene products in a given proteome . however, these methods begin to fail as the sequence becomes more distant from proteins of known function . since protein tertiary structure is more conserved than sequence, structure can play an important role in functional annotation . however, experimental determination of protein structure
