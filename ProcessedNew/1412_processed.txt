gene expression discrete mixture modeling to address genetic heterogeneity in time-to-event regression motivation: time-to-event regression models are a critical tool for associating survival time outcomes with molecular data. despite mounting evidence that genetic subgroups of the same clinical disease exist, little attention has been given to exploring how this hetero-geneity affects time-to-event model building and how to accommodate it. methods able to diagnose and model heterogeneity should be valuable additions to the biomarker discovery toolset. results: we propose a mixture of survival functions that classifies subjects with similar relationships to a time-to-event response. this model incorporates multivariate regression and model selection and can be fit with an expectation maximization algorithm, we call cox-assisted clustering. we illustrate a likely manifestation of genetic het-erogeneity and demonstrate how it may affect survival models with little warning. an application to gene expression in ovarian cancer dna repair pathways illustrates how the model may be used to learn new genetic subsets for risk stratification. we explore the implications of this model for censored observations and the effect on genomic pre-dictors and diagnostic analysis. availability and implementation: r implementation of cac using standard packages is available at https://gist.github.com/programeng/ 8620b85146b14b6edf8f data used in the analysis are publicly available.in cancer genomic studies, unobserved heterogeneity obfuscates the effort to build accurate descriptive models of risk stratification. in ovarian cancer, for example,argue that the set of patients with the same clinical disease have distinct molecular diseases. with respect to inference, this implies that the same regression models may not be valid for every patient and further that it is unclear which patients should be considered together . therefore, a major statistical task is to organize patients into previously unknown classes while simultaneously fitting their time-to-event models.the examples throughout the article are taken from our ongoing analysis of data from the cancer genome atlas (tcga), which has the goal of cataloging all of the genomic alterations in cancer. for each patient, there is a tremendous amount and variety of data: 12 000 genes in expression arrays, 1 million singlenucleotide polymorphism genotypes, exome and whole-genome sequences, methylation of thousands of cpg islands and the expression of microrna. from this plurality of data, we anticipate that exploratory methods will serve to extract and characterize genetic subgroups relevant to survival time clinical outcomes. for summarizing the impact of a genetic signature, one often stratifies patients to demonstrate separation between classdefined survival curve estimates. unfortunately, asreview, current methods either awkwardly dichotomize a continuous score at a post hoc threshold or rely on hierarchical clustering to define subgroups with no necessary relation to survival. in that sense, it is desirable to have a method that identifies genetic subgroups supervised by their survival times. the standard methods for dealing with non-homogenous time-to-event data do not apply when our goal is to discover unknown subgroups. continuous frailty models treat all individuals separately and therefore do not produce subgroups. oemphasize the use of random effects and stratified regression models when subgroups are known. classification and regression tree methods have been adapted for survival responses . however, these methods partition the predictor space to form a single piecewise functional estimate, and our interest is in the subgroups that exist in similar regions. some treatment of heterogeneity relevant to survival time where a subgroup of patients does not expire appears in the cure rate model literature . our situation is distinct in three ways: a subgroup may have variable time-to-event outcomes (cured patients have infinite survival times), the variables of interest to each mixture component may be distinct and the set of patients in each subgroup is not known. in this article, we propose a discrete mixture regression model that synergizes with potential heterogeneity in time-to-event data. concretely, we assume that observations belong to unlabeled classes with class-specific proportional hazards (ph) regression models relating their genetic covariates to survival time outcomes (section 3). this conditional semi-parametric model leads to a surprising variety of model effects, which we illustrate to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this is an

an algorithm and the considerations for fitting the model. simulations highlight the use of censored data (section 5) and a data analysis demonstrates a single-pathway hypothesis-driven model (section 6). our discussion (section 7) again emphasizes the exploratory role that this analysis may address.in this article, we have presented a model for heterogeneity in time-to-event data. although its actual formulation is straightforward, the treatment of unknown classification, a consideration of the implications for censoring, the effect on genomic predictors and diagnostic analysis have not been previously considered. finally, we have presented a novel and informative analysis in section 6, which begins to identify the set of survivalassociated and subgroup-dependent alterations in expression. admirably, this model relaxes the whole model ph assumption to conditional ph given cluster membership. in an exploratory situation, the utility of this flexibility cannot be overstated. both our simulated and applied analysis highlight that our understanding of censoring has been augmented and the use of information in the model is intuitively simple. in a data analytic view, informaticists are familiar with unsupervised clustering analysis and class-label supervised clustering analysis. our algorithm may be seen as a way to use a survival time (possibly censored) to supervise the clustering of gene expression data. this clustering property is distinct from ensemble-type methods [e.g., where covariate information may be used to reweight components. as we saw with its treatment of posterior class probabilities, the mixture believes each observation comes from a single component, while averaging over weak learners or hidden layers may be relevant to a more admixed sample. with respect to developing ovarian cancer biomarkers, our data analysis has shown an example where class identification leads to risk stratification. we might further identify high-and low-risk classes within the assigned clusters as is standard practice, but this is no longer a required post-processing part of the expression analysis. the cac algorithm has also given us its posterior weights allowing a concrete measure of uncertainty for downstream analyses. in the tcga project, as in many other cancer genomic studies, there are issues of both high-dimensional data and variable selection. as presented, the cac regression framework does not incorporate these, but it can be extended with additional study.
