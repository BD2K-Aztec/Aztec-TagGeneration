probabilistic single-individual haplotyping motivation: accurate haplotypingdetermining from which parent particular portions of the genome are inheritedis still mostly an un-resolved problem in genomics. this problem has only recently started to become tractable, thanks to the development of new long read sequencing technologies. here, we introduce probhap, a haplotyping algorithm targeted at such technologies. the main algorithmic idea of probhap is a new dynamic programming algorithm that exactly optimizes a likelihood function specified by a probabilistic graphical model and which generalizes a popular objective called the minimum error correction. in addition to being accurate, probhap also provides confidence scores at phased positions. results: on a standard benchmark dataset, probhap makes 11 fewer errors than current state-of-the-art methods. this accuracy can be further increased by excluding low-confidence positions, at the cost of a small drop in haplotype completeness. availability: our source code is freely available at: https://github.com/ kuleshov/probhap.although modern sequencing technology has led to rapid advances in genomics over the past decade, it has largely been unable to resolve an important aspect of human genetics: genomic phase. each human chromosome comes in two copies: one inherited from the mother, and one inherited from the father. despite the fact that differences between these copies play an important biological role, until recently, decoding these differences (a process known as haplotyping or genome phasing) has been a major technological challenge. in recent years, however, we have seen an emergence of new long read technologies that may one day enable routine cost-effective haplotyping. because a long read comes from a single chromosome copy, it reveals the phase of all heterozygous genomic positions that it covers. by connecting long reads at their overlapping heterozygous positions, it is possible to extend this phase information into haplotype blocks, in a process referred to as single-individual haplotyping (sih) . although from the molecular biology side, routine haplotyping seems close to becoming a reality, dealing with long read data remains non-trivial computationally. under most formulations of the problem, it is np-hard to recover the optimal haplotypes from noisy sequencing reads . this has led to a vast literature on heuristics for dealing with this problem as accurately as possible. here, we propose a new algorithm, probhap, which offers an 11 improvement in accuracy over the current leading method, refhap. unlike most other algorithms, probhap also provides confidence scores in addition to genomic phase. these scores can be used to prune low-accuracy positions and further improve haplotype quality, at the cost of phasing fewer variants. the main algorithmic ideas of probhap are a new dynamic programming algorithm and a probabilistic graphical model. the dynamic programming algorithm determines the haplotypes that maximize the likelihood function preadsjtrue haplotypes specified by the probabilistic model as well as the probability that these haplotypes are correct. it can be seen as a special case of the well-known variable elimination algorithm . from a theoretical point of view, the likelihood function specified by our probabilistic model generalizes a well-known objective called the minimum error correction (mec). previously proposed exact dynamic programming algorithms for the mec can be easily derived as special cases of the general variable elimination algorithm within our model. more interestingly, alternative formulations of this algorithm (corresponding to different variable orderings) result in novel exact algorithms that are significantly faster than previous ones. thus, our work generalizes several previous approaches and provides a systematic way of deriving new haplotyping algorithms.given comparable phasing rates and n50 block lengths, probhap produced haplotype blocks with more accurate longrange phase: the long-range switch error of probhap was 11 lower than that of the second best algorithm, refhap . in addition, probhap also produced 6 fewer short switch errors than refhap. note that long switch accuracy is substantially more important than short switch accuracy, as it drastically changes the global structure of haplotypes. short switch errors, on the i380in summary, we have introduced a new single-individual phasing algorithm, probhap, that offers an 11 improvement in accuracy over the current state-of-the-art method, refhap. in addition, it is one of the only methods to provide the user with confidence scores at every position; these confidence scores can be used to prune positions whose phase is uncertain and thus substantially increase the overall accuracy. the advances behind probhap are made possible by framing the phasing problem within a probabilistic graphical models framework. this framework makes it particularly easy to reason about the problem; in fact, all our algorithms are special cases of standard procedures for optimizing graphical models. on the theoretical side, this work generalizes the mec criterion used by existing methods. our approach allows us to obtain existing algorithms as special cases of well-known optimization procedures, and also easily derive new, more efficient algorithms; it may thus serve as a foundation for further algorithmic insights.
