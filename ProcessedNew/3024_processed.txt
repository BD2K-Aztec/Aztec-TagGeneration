mobility-based prediction of hydration structures of protein surfaces motivation: hydration largely determines solubility, aggregation of proteins and influences interactions between proteins and drug molecules. despite the importance of hydration, structural determination of hydration structure of protein surfaces is still challenging from both experimental and theoretical viewpoints. the precision of experimental measurements is often affected by fluctuations and mobility of water molecules resulting in uncertain assignment of water positions. results: our method can utilize mobility as an information source for the prediction of hydration structure. the necessary information can be produced by molecular dynamics simulations accounting for all atomic interactions including waterwater contacts. the predictions were validated and tested by comparison to more than 1500 crystallographic water positions in 20 hydrated protein molecules including enzymes of biomedical importance such as cyclin-dependent kinase 2. the agreement with experimental water positions was larger than 80 on average. the predictions can be particularly useful in situations where no or limited experimental knowledge is available on hydration structures of molecular surfaces. availability and implementation: the method is implemented in a standalone c program mobywat released under

hydrogen bonds formed by waters stabilize protein structure and affect folding . surface water molecules are mediators of the assembly of bamyloid protofilaments of alzheimers disease and there is evidence that structurally conserved waters are parts of electron transfer networks such as respiratory chain . structures of many gprotein-coupled receptors are also stabilized by hydration . a

fundamental role in charge transfer, allostery and energy flow . water molecules are often considered essential parts of the protein structure and the first hydration shell is a key determinant of the solubility and aggregation of solute molecules . proteinprotein and proteinligand interactions are influenced by surface-bound water molecules, and therefore, knowledge of their location is of great importance during structure-based drug design . tightly bound water molecules can affect the chemical diversity of designed ligands (garca) leading to simple rules for the use of water molecules in drug design and also in interpretation of ligand-based pharmacophore models . inclusion of explicit water molecules in drug design have been thoroughly studied and was found to be of central importance in ligandprotein docking (;). although hydration structure is important, it has hitherto proven to be very difficult to determine at the atomic level by experimental means largely due to mobility and complexity of interactions of water molecules located on a protein surface. the residence of a water molecule on the surface and its exchange with bulk are affected not primarily by the strength of proteinwater interactions, but it is rather a topography that prevents the water molecule from exchanging by a cooperative mechanism (halle, 2004 a). importantly, such a cooperative mechanism of exchange also governs several waterwater interactions that can often be detected between surface water molecules . it is problematic to handle (and to predict) the residence of water molecules in the hydration layer of a protein using merely thermodynamic or kinetic approaches . crystallography is the prime experimental method for detection of water positions, via electron density maps and used as the de facto standard . however, there are still numerous limitations of this method coming from low resolution of large structural assemblies , assignment problems , and artifacts due to cryogenic temperatures used . a number of computational methods have been proposed for prediction of hydration structure on protein surfaces. such methods generally require the dry protein structure as an input and provide predictions for hydration structure using a variety of algorithms. a large group of the methods uses fast and simplified approaches disregarding exchange (mobility) between surface and bulk water molecules and dynamics of the hydration structure. they assume a static picture of hydration shells and focus on finding appropriate binding sites of water molecules on the protein surface using scoring schemes, energy calculations , prior knowledge , h-bonding information or artificial neural networks . several studies have dealt with construction and use of density distribution functions of hydration shells for different atom types occurring in proteins. limitations of generalized, densitybased approaches were discussed in detail . these methods ignore dynamics and cooperativity governing hydration. with advancement of computational infrastructure and force fields, the efficiency and chemical accuracy of atomic level montecarlo and molecular dynamics (md) simulations has increased enormously in the past decades enabling their applications in cutting edge drug design projects . it has become a routine task to generate md trajectories with explicit water molecules for virtually any protein of interest. atomistic simulations of md hold a conceptual advantage over the static or density-based (trained) methods as the mobility, a key determinant of hydration structure is described directly at atomic level. whereas such benefits of atomic md calculations have been extensively used in analyses , there are not many md-based methods for prediction of the hydration structure . these approaches focus on all individual positions of hydrating water molecules and apply various evaluation schemes such as the definition of time averaged positions for calculation of the hydration structure. in this study, we introduce a mobility-based atomic-level method for prediction of hydration structure of molecular surfaces using only dry protein structures as input. our method was tested on 20 proteins, and the corresponding computational procedures are provided in a program mobywat, which can be used in conjunction with any md software that can produce all-atom md trajectories.
