inferring gene ontologies from pairwise similarity data motivation: while the manually curated gene ontology (go) is widely used, inferring a go directly from-omics data is a compelling new problem. recognizing that ontologies are a directed acyclic graph (dag) of terms and hierarchical relations, algorithms are needed that: (1) analyze a full matrix of genegene pairwise similarities from-omics data; (2) infer true hierarchical structure in these data rather than enforcing hierarchy as a computational artifact; and (3) respect biological pleiotropy, by which a term in the hierarchy can relate to multiple higher level terms. methods addressing these requirements are just beginning to emergenone has been evaluated for go inference. methods: we consider two algorithms [clique extracted ontology (clixo), localfitness] that uniquely satisfy these requirements, compared with methods including standard clustering. clixo is a new approach that finds maximal cliques in a network induced by progressive thresholding of a similarity matrix. we evaluate each methods ability to reconstruct the go biological process ontology from a similarity matrix based on (a) semantic similarities for go itself or (b) three-omics datasets for yeast. results: for task (a) using semantic similarity, clixo accurately reconstructs go (499 precision, recall) and outperforms other approaches (520 precision, 520 recall). for task (b) using-omics data, clixo outperforms other methods using two-omics datasets and achieves $30 precision and recall using yeastnet v3, similar to an earlier approach (network extracted ontology) and better than localfitness or standard clustering (2025 precision, recall). conclusion: this study provides algorithmic foundation for building gene ontologies by capturing hierarchical and pleiotropic structure embedded in biomolecular data.ontologies have proven very useful for capturing and organizing knowledge as a hierarchical set of terms and their interrelationships. in biology, one of the most successful and widely used ontologies is from the gene ontology (go) project, a major effort to represent gene functions in cellular level processes across organisms . go is the default source of functional annotations for virtually every experimental system and the gold standard for measuring the success of bioinformatic methods . it is extensively used by researchers in a wide variety of situations, such as understanding the function of genes discovered in a genome wide association study or computationally predicting functions for uncharacterized genes . an important feature of go is that the ontology structure is constructed by a diverse team of scientists according to their best abilities to curate the published scientific literature. as the amount of cell biological literature increases, however, curating the ontology structure has become a painstaking effort that is proving difficult to scale up and systematize . moreover, human curation necessarily favors biological entities that have been well studied and misses the large proportion of cell biology that is not yet known or has not yet been curated. for these reasons, it is not possible to directly learn about an uncharacterized gene or discover a new function using go, and one cannot quickly assemble an ontology model for a new organism, let alone a specific cell type or disease state. recently, it has been shown by some of us that a go can be inferred directly from molecular data as a complement to further curation efforts (www.nexontology.org) . for ontology curators, this approach is extremely valuable in three ways. first. .. it finds connections missed by curators. second, it will save huge amounts of curation time by pointing curators to the data that matter. third, it provides a qualitycontrol check on the go that is unbiased by the vagaries of publication policies, as it is based only on the data themselves . furthermore, the ability to rapidly generate ontologies from data opens up new possibilities for the use of ontologies in general. for example, data-driven ontologies generated from diseased and normal samples could be compared. this would be a novel way to look at what goes awry in particular disease states, providing the context and perspective of complex, interrelated biological processes . such an ontology model may also serve as the basis for an intelligent, predictive agent, as one of us has described elsewhere . despite these possibilities inspired by an initial attempt it remains an open question as to how best algorithmically to infer an ontology from molecular data. to understand the challenges involved in inferring an ontology from data, we first must recognize that ontologies contain both syntactic information (terms and their structural relations) as well as semantic information (relations between terms have defined meaningsin go these include is a, part of and regulates relations). both our previous work and this work will focus on inferring the syntactic informationthe ontology terms, their relations and the annotations of genes to terms. this syntactic information is the most commonly used information by biologists using go as a gold standard. to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article

where gene annotations propagate up the hierarchy from child terms to parent terms through is a and part of relations. for example, in the biological process (bp) branch, m phase of mitotic cell cycle and interphase of mitotic cell cycle are child terms beneath mitotic cell cycle. since go is a dag, any term can have multiple parents and/or multiple children. allowing for multiple children per term is necessary to capture the biological truth that many molecular machines have more than two subunits, or that a bp such as the interphase of cell cycle can be split into more than two phases (g1, s, g2). multiple parents are necessary to capture the biological principle of pleiotropythe reuse of genes and/or subunits, or the classification of a bp into multiple higher categories of process (e.g. sulfur amino acid metabolic process is a child of both cellular amino acid metabolic process and sulfur compound metabolic process). in order to faithfully infer an ontology of genes like go, we need an algorithm able to infer a dag. in previous work, we developed a multistep algorithm for constructing a network extracted ontology (nexo), which infers a dag structure from data summarized in the form of a molecular interaction or gene similarity network . this algorithm first infers a binary tree using the hac-ml algorithm . then, splits without network support are collapsed, creating nodes with more than 2 children. finally, a post-processing step searches for additional parent child relationships between existing nodes, allowing for a single node to have multiple parents. the nexo algorithm does not use quantitative information about gene interaction or similarity, i.e. it assumes an input network for which the edges are unweighted. however, typical genome-scale data such as gene expression correlation populate a full matrix of similarity scores between pairs of genes where all of the information is contained in the weights. while thresholding these data is one way to interpret them as unweighted networks, this results in information loss not only below but also above the threshold, as hierarchical structure embedded in the weights is collapsed. furthermore, when combining multiple types of data (as will be undoubtedly required for construction of a complete ontology of gene function), it is useful to give greater weight to gene pairs which have evidence of similarity in multiple datasets . since the nexo algorithm is unable to use valuable information contained in the weights of edges in an input network, it is instead forced to rely on setting a proper threshold below which all information is ignored and above which relative weights are lost. the essence of the dag inference problem is to detect communities of genes that span a wide range of sizes/scales and can nest hierarchically as well as share arbitrary subsets of members. furthermore, the algorithm should be able to construct a dag using the information contained in weighted networks, and it should be capable of operating on a nearly complete, weighted graph with a genome-scale number of nodes (thousands) and edges (millions). a number of existing clustering algorithms address parts of this challenge. for example, there are many commonly used hierarchical clustering algorithms which use similarity or distance scores as input and infer a nested hierarchy of clusters . these methods, however, rely on iterative joining of pairs of terms, resulting in forced construction of a binary tree. clusters cannot overlap (i.e. have multiple parents for a single node) or have42 children, and the number of clusters inferred is fixed at n 1 where n is the number of terminal nodes. there have recently been a handful of algorithms which construct hierarchies with overlapping clusters, by creating a first level of overlapping clusters with terminal nodes and then combining these base clusters into higher level clusters . these algorithms all present solutions that allow multiple parents and multiple children at the initial level of clusters, and some operate on weighted networks. however, these methods restrict each higher level cluster to having a single parent. this aspect inherently limits the types of relations that can be discovered by these methods. another relevant method has been proposed that hierarchically clusters links in a graph rather than edges . this method is quite flexible and allows for each node in the graph to appear in multiple clusters via participation in multiple edges. such a method still restricts the types of clusters it creates, however. first, an edge can only participate in a single cluster at each level of the hierarchy (although a pair of nodes may incidentally participate in multiple clusters via other edges). secondly, the hierarchical clustering of the edges allows only for binary joins between edges and therefore each lower level cluster will be joined with exactly one other cluster at each step. this process creates e 1 clusters, where e is the number of edges in the input graph. while the original paper proposes a method for determining a single optimal cut in the hierarchy for determining clusters, how to determine all levels of the hierarchy that are meaningful and not an artifact of construction remains an open question. the localfitness algorithm, which has recently been proposed in the physics community, is to our knowledge the only previous approach that constructs a dag from an unweighted or weighted network and has a principled way of determining which clusters are robust . this method constructs clusters at a given level in the hierarchy by optimizing a fitness function for each of many potentially overlapping clusters built out from multiple seed nodes. the fitness function includes a parameter that is tuned to find clusters at multiple levels of the hierarchy. graph partitionings that are stable across comparatively wide ranges of this parameter are used. here we present a basic formulation of the ontology inference problem followed by a description of a new method, called clique extracted ontology (clixo), for ontology inference based on progressive identification of maximal cliques. we evaluate clixo in comparison with localfitness as well as several other methods such as the nexo algorithm and standard clustering. methods are evaluated based on their ability to reconstruct the go from two starting datasets: (a) pairwise semantic similarities, which are derived directly from go itself, and (b) three different-omics datasets (genetic interaction profile correlation, gene expression correlation and an integrated-omics dataset for yeast).here we have explored the requirements for inferring an ontology from a similarity matrix and available methods for doing so, as well as proposed a new method, clixo. we found that clixo outperforms other methods when a reliable similarity matrix is available. when using-omics data, we found that clixo outperforms other methods on two of three datasets tested and ties the nexo algorithm on the third, where both were able to successfully infer an ontology similar to go bp. furthermore, clixo proved significantly more stable than nexo to changes in parameters. this study provides the algorithmic foundation for building gene ontologies by capturing hierarchical and pleiotropic structure embedded in biomolecular data.
