simultaneous gene finding in multiple genomes motivation: as the tree of life is populated with sequenced genomes ever more densely, the new challenge is the accurate and consistent annotation of entire clades of genomes. we address this problem with a new approach to comparative gene finding that takes a multiple genome alignment of closely related species and simultaneously predicts the location and structure of protein-coding genes in all input genomes, thereby exploiting negative selection and sequence conservation. the model prefers potential gene structures in the different genomes that are in agreement with each other, orif notwhere the exon gains and losses are plausible given the species tree. we formulate the multi-species gene finding problem as a binary labeling problem on a graph. the resulting optimization problem is np hard, but can be efficiently approximated using a subgradient-based dual decomposition approach. results: the proposed method was tested on whole-genome alignments of 12 vertebrate and 12 drosophila species. the accuracy was evaluated for human, mouse and drosophila melanogaster and compared to competing methods. results suggest that our method is well-suited for annotation of (a large number of) genomes of closely related species within a clade, in particular, when rna-seq data are available for many of the genomes. the transfer of existing annotations from one genome to another via the genome alignment is more accurate than previous approaches that are based on protein-spliced alignments, when the genomes are at close to medium distances. availability and implementation: the method is implemented in c as part of augustus and available open source atwith recent technologies in whole-genome sequencing, the sequencing of entire clades of genomes is in progress. for example, the genome 10k project launched in 2009 has taken on the task of sequencing the genomes of 10 000 vertebrate species (genome 10k community of). other examples include the 5000 insect genome project (i5k) and the 1000 fungal genomes project of the jgi. the annotation of genomes, in turn, is a rather slow process. an important step is the identification of protein-coding genes. although many automatic tools for gene finding are available, none of them is able to predict genes genome-wide without a substantial rate of wrong gene structures or missing genes. for instance, a survey from 2013 suggests that even the most accurate tools are merely predicting 48.53 of the genes (at least one splice form) in drosophila melanogaster correctly, when using only rna-seq data as evidence. for a recent review on the subject, see. another evidence source besides transcriptome sequence is homology. one class of methods that exploit homology uses previously identified protein sequences from related species or from a database and performs a spliced alignment against a target genome. examples are exonerate and genomethreader that align single protein sequences to the target genome and genewise and augustus-ppx that take entire protein families represented as sequence profiles as input. these approaches depend on the correctness of the input proteins, their similarity to the target clade and the overlap of the respective proteomes. they are usually suited only as one component of a whole-genome annotation pipeline. the ensembl pipeline, for example, uses amongst other tools genewise and exonerate for protein sequence-based gene prediction. a second class of methods that exploit homology are comparative gene finders. these methods take two or more genome sequences as input and exploit that homolog genes have often a very similar gene structure. by aligning the genomes of related species, conserved regions become visible that are enriched in protein-coding exons but also other functional dna. initial comparative approaches to gene finding such as twinscan simultaneously predict genes in exactly two input genomes (e.g. of human and mouse), but are rather proofs-ofconcept and seem to play no substantial role in current genome annotation. to take advantage of a multiple genome alignment, alternative approaches restrict gene finding to a single target genome and use an alignment between the target and multiple related genomes to inform gene finding in the target. examples are contrast and n-scan . in particular, contrast achieved striking results (58.6 sensitivity and 35.5 specificity for human on gene level). despite the very good performance of comparative gene finding and the potential to combine homology evidence with evidence from transcriptome sequencing, contrast and n-scan are rarely used for whole-genome annotation. reasons may include the fact that both require an elaborate parameter training specific to the set of informant genomes, that has to be repeated for every genome in the clade that should be annotated, which, even if automated, leads to a running-time quadratic in the number of genomes. a methodical disadvantage is further the restriction of gene finding to a single target genome. this has the drawback that likely gene structures in the informant genomes are not taken into consideration when choosing a gene structure in the target genome. we present a novel approach to comparative gene finding that simultaneously identifies genes in k ! 2 genomes and that is suitable for the annotation of entire clades of genomes, e.g. the runtime is linear in the number of genomes k. we introduce a graph-theoretical framework and formulate the problem as a binary labeling problem on a graph. in general, exact inference in this model is not tractable, however, we can take advantage of the special structure of the graph that allows decomposition into two tractable sub problems: finding longest paths in directed acyclic graphs (dags), and maximum a-posteriori probability (map) inference on trees. a subgradientbased dual decomposition approach is derived for approximate inference, guaranteeing an upper bound on the approximation error. dual decomposition and more generally lagrangian relaxation has already been applied to a variety of inference problems, e.g. for the multiple sequence alignment problem , computer vision and natural language processing . more recently, dual decomposition was adopted for integrating rna-seq evidence into hmm-based gene structure prediction . the proposed method is implemented as an extension to the gene finder augustus and in the following referred to as augustus cgp. the required inputs are the genomes of two or more species as well as an alignment and a phylogenetic tree of the genomes. with no further information, augustus cgp infers gene structures de novo by only making use of the raw genomes and alignment information. augustus cgp incorporates evidence for negative selection by computing an estimate for the ratio of non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions x dn=ds for all considered candidate coding exons. furthermore, augustus cgp can incorporate additional evidence, e.g. from rna-seq and existing annotations. the latter is used for the special application of transferring a trusted annotation from a known genome to newly sequenced genomes. the performance of augustus cgp for all three tasksde novo/evidence-based gene finding and cross-species annotation transferis evaluated on two data sets, a vertebrate and a drosophila subclade of 12 species each, and discussed in the results section. training the parameters of augustus cgp is not more expensive than hitherto for a single genome. the species-specific parameters are only learned for one representative in the clade (e.g. human in a mammalian clade) with no need for retraining when more genomes are added to the clade or removed. apart from the species-specific parameters there are only few extra cross-species parameters to adjust such as rates for exon gain and loss.in this article we presented a novel approach to comparative gene finding that is suitable for gene structure annotation of entire clades. its novelty is that it simultaneously identifies genes in multiple genomes. previous gene finding systems were either limited to exactly two genomes or restricted the prediction and gene structure model to a single target genome. unlike the target-informant approach that requires a repetitive training of parameters for each and every genome to be annotated, parameters only have to be trained for a single representative in the clade. beside the cds of a gene, our approach can also predict utrs. this is particularly useful when incorporating rna-seq evidence that gives unspecific hints about both coding and non-coding parts of genes. as a tendency, our approach favors gene structures that are in agreement across the genomes. thus, it is likely to produce more consistent gene sets than the ones obtained from the individual annotation of each genome. this is particularly important when the objective of study is to investigate the genomic differences of several species within a clade. the results show that the new multi-species version of augustus is more accurate than the standard single-species version. in the de novo category where only genome evidence is used it compares favorably with n-scan. on exon level, it is even competitive with contrast. although contrast still achieves the most accurate de novo predictions for human and fly, it appears to have no practical relevance for current whole-genome annotation. augustus cgp, in turn, is developed specifically for the increasingly important clade annotation problem with an eye towards practical aspects, e.g. efficient scalability for a large number of genomes in the clade, as few clade-specific parameters as possible, etc. in evidence-based gene finding our findings are, that the effectiveness of rna-seq evidence decreases with an increasing distance of the source species to the target species. when having rna-seq evidence for the target species itself, there is only modest benefit from rna-seq evidence from other species in the clade. this may, however, be different for other clades and libraries. annotation can be transferred using augustus cgp from one genome to another via the multiple genome alignment. a previously existing option to do this is the alignment of the source proteins (or transcripts) to the target genome. genome alignments however have the advantage that the context around the exons and genes is also used to identify what is homolog. for example, initial coding exons can be very short and therefore very difficult to align correctly in a protein alignment, even if the genomes are similar, whereas a genome alignment may have no difficulty when the neighboring utr or intron is also alignable. at very large distances, however, where genome alignments are hardly or not at all possible, protein (family) homology searches are still useful, at least to identify conserved domains of the gene. the dual decomposition approach has proven to be a well-suited framework to efficiently obtain good approximate and even mostly exact solutions to the formal optimization problem of comparative gene finding. a common weakness of gene predictors is to distinguish between correct candidate exons and partly correct candidate exons that only differ from each other by a few base pairs. when, for example, classifying all exons in d. mel as correctly predicted that overlap a truescores (harmonic mean of sensitivity and specificity) on exon level for transferring the annotation from a non-mouse vertebrate genome (source) to the mouse genome (target). values are given for different source genomes with an increasing distance to the target (horizontal axis). the rightmost data points are the accuracies, when using the combined annotations of all source genomes, e.g. rat, human, cow and chicken. augustus cgp uses a whole-genome alignment between mouse and 11 other vertebrates as well as annotation evidence (cds and intron hints) for the source genome(s)simultaneous gene finding in multiple genomes
