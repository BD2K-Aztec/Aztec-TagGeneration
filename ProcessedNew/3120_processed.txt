structural bioinformatics msmexplorer: visualizing markov state models for biomolecule folding simulations markov state models (msms) for the study of biomolecule folding simulations have emerged as a powerful tool for computational study of folding dynamics. msmexplorer is a visualization application purpose-built to visualize these msms with an aim to increase the efficacy and reach of msm science.in kinetics-based markov state models (msms) for biomolecule folding simulations, conformation space is partitioned according to natural free-energy barriers, avoiding problematic clustering approximations . since their introduction in 2009, programs for generating these models have seen substantial interest and use . current visualization tools for msms are essentially manual, inhibiting visual analysis of msms and slowing down figure production for publications. indeed, it has become clear that visualization is now a key bottleneck in the use of msms to understand kinetic phenomena of interest. msmexplorer is an application to address this visualization bottleneck. specifically, msmexplorer has three primary aims:(1) to provide a tool for efficient visual analysis of msms.(2) to streamline the production of publication-ready figures for common msm network visualization types.(3) to synthesize disparate msm research tools into a single intuitive graphical interface.a visualization tool for msms for biomolecule folding simulations, called msmexplorer, has been developed for the purpose of increasing the efficacy of doing folding science with msms. the program is currently being used for visual analysis and visualization production for publications in the pande lab. active development will continue to refine msmexplorer to further achieve its primary aim of advancing folding simulation research.
