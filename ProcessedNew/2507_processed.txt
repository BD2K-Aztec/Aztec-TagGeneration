systems biology integrating literature-constrained and data-driven inference of signalling networks motivation: recent developments in experimental methods facilitate increasingly larger signal transduction datasets. two main approaches can be taken to derive a mathematical model from these data: training a network (obtained, e.g., from literature) to the data, or inferring the network from the data alone. purely data-driven methods scale up poorly and have limited interpretability, whereas literature-constrained methods cannot deal with incomplete networks. results: we present an efficient approach, implemented in the r package cnorfeeder, to integrate literature-constrained and data-driven methods to infer signalling networks from perturbation experiments. our method extends a given network with links derived from the data via various inference methods, and uses information on physical interactions of proteins to guide and validate the integration of links. we apply cnorfeeder to a network of growth and inflammatory signalling. we obtain a model with superior data fit in the human liver cancer hepg2 and propose potential missing pathways.information about signalling networks is increasingly abundant. thanks to novel high-throughput methods, large amounts of data about the interactions among proteins is available, which is encompassed in (unsigned and undirected) proteinprotein interaction networks (pins) . more precise (but with less coverage) information is derived from literature and is often described by means of signed and directed causal interactions among proteins. these give rise to what we will call here prior knowledge networks (pkns). pkns are partially collected in different databases [e.g. kegg , reactome , wikipathways and several are accessible via the portal pathway commons (. these databases typically contain literature-derived interactions curated with different degrees of stringency, and based on experimental publications under different experimental conditions using different cell types. pkns are, for example, very useful to study topological properties of networks or to map data (ideker and sharan 2008, terfve and saez-rodriguez 2012). however, they are not functional in the sense that they cannot be used for simulation of a signalling process and therefore prediction of the outcome of a certain experiment, which is fundamental to understand signal transduction and its alterations. the most common way to model a signalling network is to write down its biochemistry and subsequently translate it to a mathematical form, typically a system of differential equations . however, information in pkns often lacks the required mechanistic detail. in these cases, logic formalisms are a useful approach since all they need is to add logic gates to the existing (signed and directed) interactions. one can generate logic gates by manual curation based on literature, for example , reviewed in . an alternative to manual curation consists of generating a logic model from the pkn that is subsequently trained to experimental data . this method, implemented in the bioconductor package cellnoptr (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/saezrodriguez/software.html), provides context-specific models with predictive power. it is efficient at handling large amounts of data as the space of possible models is limited by the prior knowledge. this key feature of the approach, however, is also its main limitation: there might be missing links as databases are not complete, and the effect of cross talk between pathways is often not taken into account in the canonical linear representation of the pathways. hence, adding links to the pkn based on the dedicated data can lead to an improved goodness of fit . with a different and complementary perspective, different reverse engineering methods have been used to infer networks from perturbation experiments using data-driven methods that do not rely on prior knowledge of the network . most of these methods were first developed for transcriptional data but can be applied also to signalling data. for example, in bayesian networks were used to infer the connections between 67 proteins with high-throughput data collected using a micro-western array. two mutual information-based to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author(s) 2012. published

and the context likelihood of relatedness (clr) , were also applied to the same dataset to corroborate the results. different methods were also applied in the context of the dream initiative (www.the-dream-project.org) for the dream4 predictive signalling network challenge . twelve research groups inferred signalling networks from perturbation experiments data and were evaluated based on the accuracy of their predictions of the outcome of the network under different experimental conditions. one of the methods that performed best in this task was a simple approach, strictly data-driven, that encodes significant effects of stimuli and inhibitors on measured proteins in a causeeffect network . these purely data-driven methods need to consider all possible topologies, and thus in general, need more data and scale-up worse than methods that rely on a given topology such as cellnoptr. furthermore, the resulting data-driven networks (that we will call here ddns) are limited to interactions between perturbed and measured nodes that are only a subset of the nodes involved in the pathways. thus, ddns are not as biologically interpretable as the pkns and mapping ddns to pkns is not simple as one link in the inferred network can generally correspond to multiple links in the pkn. hence, it is not trivial how to correctly map this relationship. in this article we attempt to combine the strengths of literature-based and data-driven inference methods. we describe a procedure (implemented in the r package cnorfeeder), to integrate prior knowledge encoded in the pkn with data-driven information obtained using reverse-engineering approaches. pins are used to prioritize links and to provide experimental support for them, and thus help to discriminate among options and add information on integrated links. the resulting network is then trained against experimental data to obtain a final refined model that has a better fit to data with respect to the pkn, highlighting plausible links that were missing in the pkn. we illustrate its application with a signalling network encompassing multiple pathways and readouts trained with data from the liver cancer cell hepg2. we show how cnorfeeder provides a significantly improved fit based on links supported by known interactions among proteins.the method was applied to a dataset of a human liver cell line (hepg2) from the dream 4 challenge , where the phosphorylation of seven proteins (akt, erk12, ikb, jnk12, p38, hsp27, mek12) is measured 30 min after combinatorial stimulation with four ligands (tnfa, il1a, igf1, tgfa) and four inhibitors (pi3k, ikk, p38, mek12). the level of phosphorylation of proteins is measured using the luminex xmap assay and provides a value of the phosphorylation in arbitrary units, that can be used to compare values at two conditions. in our case we compare the values between 0 and 30, and this change is a proxy of the induced activation of the corresponding protein. the normalization of this data to a value between 0 and 1 is achieved using a method based on a set of thresholds as described in . according to the cellnoptr pipeline, the pkn was first compressed removing all non-observable and non-controllable nodes and then expanded as described in to include all possible combinations of and and or gates compatible with the network obtaining a total of 62 hyperedges. additionally, 18 links inferred using feed were integrated in the network according to the procedure previously described and the integrated network was used for optimization using cellnoptr.fixing 0.001, the influence of the integration penalty on the number of integrated links selected by the optimization process on the fit of the optimal model to the data (in terms of mse) was tested as shown in. as expected, a low value of obtains the best fit but at the price of a high number of integrated links included in the optimal model (9 with 1). an increase of the value of decreases the number of selected integrated links but worsens the fit to the data. with 1000 only the integrated link tnfa!ikk is included in the optimal model: the presence of this link is well supported by the data since it lowers the mse from 0.064 (the optimal fit obtained with cellnoptr using as input the non-integrated network) to 0.040. the integrated links can be ranked as shown inaccording to the highest value of allowing their selection and thus according to their effect on the improvement of the fit. a lower number of links is selected when using the pin to additionally penalize unsupported links (highlighted in dark grey in). those links, combined with the information from the pin, suggest possible missing connections in the pkn. for example, in the pin there is an interaction between the adaptor irs1 and the kinase pdk that would justify the link igf1!akt in the compressed network since, in the pkn (in supplementary material), igf1 binds to its receptor and pdk regulates akt (links igf1!igfr and pdk1!akt in supplementary; note that inthe compressed networks are shown and thus intermediates igfr, irs1s and pdk1 are not present). therefore the path igf1!igfr !irs1s!pdk1!akt is supported by a combination of literature and interaction data. similarly, to support the link tnfa!ikk there is a validated interaction between the tnfa receptor and cot, a protein that activate ikk, leading to the combined pathway tnf!tnfr!cot!ikk. inand b the results of cellnoptr optimization (with 700) are shown using as input the compressed network and the integrated network, respectively. in the upper panels, optimal models are shown: links selected by the optimization algorithm are represented with continuous line if derived from the pkn and dotted line if integrated using feed. in the lower panel the improvement in the fit is shown (from 0.064 to 0.022), which is particularly large for proteins ikb, mek12 and akt. in this case study, using the same parameter setting ( 0.001, 700), networks integrated using aracne and clr do not provide an improvement of the fit, whereas bayesian networks obtain an mse of 0.040 (see supplementary material). as for the computational times, feed, clr and aracne inferred the network in $1 second whereas bayesian inference took $1 h on a cluster. to evaluate the scalability of our method, we applied cnorfeeder to a larger dataset obtained also in the cell lines hepg2, comprising 7 stimuli, 7 inhibitors and 15 readouts . we obtained comparably good results (see supplementary material). furthermore, we investigated the ability of our method to capture feedback loops, which are fundamental in the regulationof signal transduction. we constructed a toy model containing a negative feedback loops and simulated data at two different time points (10 and 30 min). we used feed as a reverse-engineering method to retrieve, from the data, a link of the feedback that was missing in the pkn and then applied a recently implemented package of cellnoptr (www.cellnopt.org) that, looking also at the second time point, was able to select all links of the feedback loop (see supplementary material for further details). a b. mapping of the pkn to the pin. (a) represents the subgraph of the pin that include only nodes belonging to the pkn (dark grey) and nodes used in the mapping of integrated links (light grey); the network was plotted with r package igraph. the same colour code is used for the edges: as expected, shortest paths between nodes in the pkn (dark grey) are generally shorter than paths used to map integrated links (light grey). this is highlighted also in (b) where the density of the shortest path length (in terms of number of edges) is plotted for integrated links, for links in the pkn and for random links 2316exploit data from all multiple combinatorial perturbation experiments. it is not the purpose of this study to compare reverseengineering methods (which would require a larger set of benchmark networks with known topology and a more realistic simulation of experimental data). the spirit of the article is more in line with the lesson derived from the dream challenges that different approaches can provide complementary insights into the same problem. we have thus employed various approaches and we plan to extend it to others in the future. furthermore, some reverseengineering methods can use prior knowledge, in particular bayesian inference methods , so that we could use the pkn or results from the training with cellnoptr to guide a further search for novel links. to conclude, the integration of literature-constrained and data-driven inference methods overcomes the limitations of both: for purely data-driven inference methods, the poor scalability (as the search space increases exponentially) and limited biological interpretability (since they are limited to measured and perturbed proteins excluding intermediate ones), and for methods constrained to prior knowledge their inability to overcome incompleteness in the networks. we propose here an approach (and software package) to combine them that is effective and extendable to include other methods.
