effects of small particle numbers on long-term behaviour in discrete biochemical systems motivation: the functioning of many biological processes depends on the appearance of only a small number of a single molecular species. additionally, the observation of molecular crowding leads to the insight that even a high number of copies of species do not guarantee their interaction. how single particles contribute to stabilizing biological systems is not well understood yet. hence, we aim at determining the influence of single molecules on the long-term behaviour of biological systems, i.e. whether they can reach a steady state. results: we provide theoretical considerations and a tool to analyse systems biology markup language models for the possibility to stabilize because of the described effects. the theory is an extension of chemical organization theory, which we called discrete chemical organization theory. furthermore we scanned the biomodels database for the occurrence of discrete chemical organizations. to exemplify our method, we describe an application to the template model of the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint mechanism. availability and implementation:systems biology heavily relies on the precise language of reaction networks (rns) to describe many different processes in cells and other living systems in a formal way . molecules and reactions can be expressed in an explicit or implicit way . these descriptions of the network only capture the static part of the model. additionally the reactor, i.e. a collection of molecules, and the dynamics, i.e. how to apply reactions to a reactor, have to be specified. there are many different ways to model the dynamics of the application of rules in a chemical system. to approximate the inherently stochastic evolution of chemical systems typically ordinary differential equations (odes) are in use . in this case, one assumes that a huge or even infinite amount of particles is present so that it is reasonable to assume continuous amounts, or more precisely, concentrations. furthermore, usually a well-stirred reactor and time constant reaction rates as well as a sequential application of rules are presumed. depending on the type of system different kinetics like mass action or michaelismenten kinetics can be used. when looking at qualitative properties, we are often interested in the long-term behaviour, i.e. the final states that the system is able to reach. in continuous dynamical systems, given by the odes, fixed points and limit cycles represent the final states of the system. chemical organization theory (cot) was developed to better understand the long-term behaviour of chemical system by introducing chemically more relevant aspects and notions. based on concepts of organization in biology , cot was developed to deal with constructive systems, i.e. systems in which new species appear and stay over a longer period. so far, cot was applied successfully in various areas like chemical computing , social systems , evolutionary game theory , hiv dynamics or checking systems biology models for inconsistencies . the theoretical results are based on the continuous dynamics and include the observation that in every fixed point there is a chemical organization . nevertheless their usefulness, the benefit to use differential equations with a rich arsenal of methods to find such solutions is finally limited by the fact that particle numbers are finite. hence, obviously not all properties of a systems behaviour can be detected.;already made some efforts to analyse small stochastic networks by analysing effects of small numbers of molecules on the stability of switches and by proposing an algorithm to enumerate the state space for spaces with small copy numbers with a limited number of newly produced molecules, respectively.discovered that for small sizes of reactors, the ratio between the amounts of species in steady state can change, and hence, called this effect discreteness-induced inversion effect . the inherent stochasticity of the dynamics in chemical systems gives rise to well-established models like the algorithm developed by). there the update of the molecules is based on the fact that the occurrence of a reaction depends solely on the abundance of molecules necessary for firing the reaction. even though stochastic dynamics are much closer to a realistic system, there are additional phenomena that are mostly not to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article

(2002) examine the effect of stochasticity, noise and small numbers of macromolecules and also pose the question so how do organisms manageand perhaps even capitalize onmolecular noise? halling (1989) even asks do the laws of chemistry apply to living cells? in other words, are the generally used settings for chemistry, described above as the assumptions for the ode system, correct for a living cell? after the initial observation of molecular crowding in cells , recently, even the tracking of single molecule production is possible . they discovered that proteins are produced in bursts from single messenger rna molecules.show how low molecule numbers change gene expression. reviews on macromolecular crowding and confinement are presented in . on the theoretical side, there is the idea of fractal kinetics , and how macromolecular crowding implies these fractal kinetics . other influences of the geometry by the kinetics are given in (b enichou et al., 2010). in this article, we put an emphasis on two aspects, which we call particle effect, of discrete systems. first, a small amount of molecules of one or more species present in the reaction vessel has an effect on the dynamical long-term behaviour of the system. second, the limitation of number of molecules in the reaction vessel is considered. we aim to detect the ability of rns to stabilize because of the impact of small molecular number or finite reactor size. this can be achieved by extending the theory of chemical organizations. for the extension, we look at the system in a discrete way, i.e. there is no concentration of molecules, but rather a discrete amount of them. this leads to discrete states and transitions between them given by possible sequences of reactions. the dynamics usable with this theory was chosen as general as possible, including mass action, michaelismenten and maximal parallelism . however, only the simplest model assuming one transition per reaction will be used in the main text. this setup yields a markov chain model on a transition graph. similar to cot, the definition of discrete organizations is based on the closure and self-maintenance properties. these two notions can be adapted to a discrete setup. all continuous organizations are found to be discrete chemical organizations as well. this makes the extension sound. the discrete organizations correspond to particular steady states, which we identified as caused by the described particle effects. to distinguish between the so far developed continuous cot and the discrete one, we denote it by discrete chemical organisation theory (dot). for the introduction of all the necessary notions in cot and markov chains, we refer to supplementary sections 1 and 2, respectively. we define discrete organizations in section 2.2. a characterisation via communication class in supplementary section 3 then establishes properties for small sizes of reactor vessels. for rns with special structural properties, stronger results hold, see supplementary section 4. finally we use our findings to examine the template model of the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint (sac) mechanism in section 3.2. we use a java implementation, which is also available online. with its help, we scanned the biomodels database for the existence of discrete organizations, see section 3.1.we provided a novel method to predict possible steady states of biological models due to the occurrence of particle effects. the theoretical foundation is an extension of cot to discrete systems. more precisely, we gave the definition of discrete chemical organizations for transition graphs. this turns out to be a generalization of the concept of chemical organizations, which was originally aimed at continuous models. we called the discrete organizations not found in cot purely discrete. they represent potential steady states due to particle effects, i.e. effects of small molecular numbers and/or finite reactor size. the former effect accounts for the biological phenomena of small numbers of copies of a molecule, molecular crowding and the spatial distribution of molecules in a cell. the latter effect might seem less natural than the former because we consider reactors with an upper bound on the number of molecules they contain. however, we want to mention two classes of example situations in which this is a reasonable assumption. first, if we consider reactions that model an inflow, e.g. through channels in a membrane, we can have the situation that inflow is blocked because of the already full inside of the reactor. second, if we model the spatial setting in a reactor, we know that single molecules occupy more space than a complex of molecules.before. the boxes refer to the states, where, for example, 1; 2; 1; 3122 in the top middle, means there is one element of species a, one of c and two of species b, the state has the unique number 31 and is part of the communication class with number 22. the labels at the transitions are the transition probabilities. there are the pdorgs fa; b; cg with a generator 1; 2; 1, fcg with a generator 0; 0; 1 and fa; bg with a generator 1; 1; 0. the light blue coloured states show the generators of the pdorgs. the grey states show the generators for the rest of organizations, namely, fag, fbg and f;g. we refer to the supplementary material, section 5, for how they can be calculated i479
