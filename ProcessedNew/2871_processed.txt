sequence analysis meqa: a pipeline for medip-seq data quality assessment and analysis motivation: we present a pipeline for the pre-processing, quality assessment, read distribution and methylation estimation for methylated dna immunoprecipitation (medip)-sequence datasets. this is the first medip-seq-specific analytic pipeline that starts at the output of the sequencers. this pipeline will reduce the data analysis load on staff and allows the easy and straightforward analysis of sequencing data for dna methylation. the pipeline integrates customized scripting and several existing tools, which can deal with both paired and single end data. availability: the package and extensive documentation, and comparison to public data is available atmethylated dna immunoprecipitation (medip) enables the rapid identification of genomic regions containing methylated cytosines. medip, in combination with hybridization to high-resolution tiling microarrays or high-throughput sequencing (hts) techniques, is a useful method for the identification of methylated cpg-rich sequences . recently, several benchmark publications reported on the use of medip-seq for genome-wide dna methylation analysis and compared it to several others methods, for example, whole-genome bisulfite-sequencing (bs-seq) and methyl-binding protein-based enrichment of methylated sequences (mbd-seq) . though medip is not substitute for bs-seq to obtain a methylome at single-nucleotide resolution, the generation of genome-wide data derived from medip-seq provides a major tool for epigenetic studies in health and disease . further, medip is specific for methylated cytosines and results are not confounded by the presence of hydroxymethylated cytosines unlike bisulfite-based methods. the main challenges resulting from the rapidly advancing technology development in dna methylation analysis is now the computational analysis of the genome-wide sequencing data . to whom correspondence should be addressed. two methods (batman and medips) have been developed for medip-seq data analysis . however, both of them do not include quality control of sequencing data or the read mapping. these methods require, therefore, considerable effort to prepare the data and run several other sequencing and quality control packages separately, increasing analysis time and potentially introducing processing errors. to fill the gap between experimental throughput and processing speed, we developed the meqa pipeline for pre-processing, data quality assessment and distribution of sequences reads and estimation of dna methylation levels of medip-seq datasets. the pipeline will also generate files for the ucsc browser. the pipeline presented here runs on the unix/linux platform and was written in the popular bioinformatics languages shell script, python and r. it can be run locally on a single linux/unix or mac server. we have tested this pipeline on our cluster with qsub and bsub commands with excellent performance. on a dell 16 cpus (each 2.67 ghz) and 32 gb memory computer server, it takes 20 h to run the entire pipeline for a mouse genome-wide dna methylation estimate that contained 20 million 50-bp length single end reads. when several lanes are combined, which would provide a similar sequencing depth as hiseq2000 data, it will take 30 h. we recommend running this pipeline on a computer with at least 16 gb memory.the meqa pipeline consists of two parts: the first one provides the general quality control of the sequence reads, and the second assesses the quality of the dna methylation analysis experiment and provides comprehensive analysis. the first part could in principle also be applied to other sequence data, e.g. for quality assessment of rna-seq data. the meqa package allows users to obtain methylation estimates from raw sequence files with a single python function call. the main advantage of meqa is its ease of use and its availability as open source, as all programs added to the pipeline are open source programs. widely used file formats are used for each step of the pipeline, e.g. fastq, sam/bam and bed files. each step of the pipeline can be replaced without compromising the workflow allowing users to update components, replace some packages and to extend and customize the pipeline for their needs. this pipeline permits to estimate methylation levels in differentially methylated regions and genes using medips. further functional analysis such as go enrichment and kegg pathway analysis for differentially methylated genes can be performed using additional bioconductor packages.
