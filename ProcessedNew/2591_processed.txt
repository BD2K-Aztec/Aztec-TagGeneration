gene expression jamie: joint analysis of multiple chip-chip experiments motivation: chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by genome tiling array hybridization (chip-chip) is a powerful approach to identify transcription factor binding sites (tfbss) in target genomes. when multiple related chip-chip datasets are available, analyzing them jointly allows one to borrow information across datasets to improve peak detection. this is particularly useful for analyzing noisy datasets. results: we propose a hierarchical mixture model and develop an r package jamie to perform the joint analysis. the genome is assumed to consist of background and potential binding regions (pbrs). pbrs have context-dependent probabilities to become bona fide binding sites in individual datasets. this model captures the correlation among datasets, which provides basis for sharing information across experiments. real data tests illustrate the advantage of jamie over a strategy that analyzes individual datasets separately. availability: jamie is freely available fromchip-chip is a powerful approach to study proteindna interactions . by coupling chromatin immunoprecipitation with genome tiling arrays, this technology allows one to create genomewide maps of transcription factor binding sites . with rapid growth of chip-chip data in public repositories such as gene expression omnibus , it becomes more and more common that multiple datasets related to the same tf, pathway or biological system are collected. when multiple such datasets are available, it is often desirable to analyze them jointly. looking at all data together not only enables one to study commonality and context-dependency of proteindna association, but also creates opportunities to borrow information across datasets to improve statistical inference. this is particularly useful if the data of primary interest are noisy and information from other datasets is required to distinguish signals from noise. to whom correspondence should be addressed.) performed by two different labs using affymetrix mouse promoter 1.0r arrays. the purpose of these experiments is to locate binding sites of two tfs, gli1 and gli3, in different cellular contexts. both gli1 and gli3 are members of gli family of tfs, which recognize the same dna motif. the figure shows log 2 fold enrichment between the normalized chip and control probe intensities. the first experiment (gli1_limb) measures gli1 binding in developing limbs of mouse embryos. this experiment has low signal-to-noise ratio due to an unoptimized chip protocol and use of a mixed cell population (gli1 is active only in the posterior fraction of the limb, but chip-chip was performed using the whole limb. as a result, cells from the anterior limb may dilute signals in the posterior limb). in spite of the weak signals, one still wants to find true gli1 binding sites in this dataset, since gli1 is a key transcriptional regulator for controlling proper development of limb. a careful examination of the data shows that peaks in these four datasets are correlated. in other words, they tend to occur at the same locations in the genome. this correlation can be potentially used to improve statistical inference. for example, the weak peak highlighted by the solid box in gli1_limb cannot be easily distinguished from background noise if one looks at this dataset alone. however, if all datasets are analyzed together, the observation that all other datasets have strong peaks at the same location suggests that the weak peak in gli1_limb is a real binding site. in contrast, the peak highlighted by the dashed box has approximately the same magnitude in the gli1_limb data, but no binding signal has been observed in the other datasets, suggesting that it is less likely to be a real binding signal. when multiple datasets are analyzed jointly, it is important to keep in mind that some tfbss are context-specific. for example, the location shown inis bound by gli in gli3_limb but not in gli1_limb and gli1_gnp (gnp stands for granule neuron precursor cells). in this case, even without referring to the other datasets, the enrichment in gli3_limb is sufficiently strong and should be called as a peak. on the other hand, one should avoid claiming that gli1_limb and gli1_gnp have peaks in this region only because there is a strong peak in gli3_limb. ideally, there should be a mechanism that automatically integrates and weighs different pieces of information, and rank peaks according to the combined evidence. this cannot be achieved by simply analyzing each dataset separately and then taking intersections of the results. in the past few years, a number of algorithms and software tools have been developed for analyzing chip-chip data.examples include tiling analysis software (tas) from affymetrix , mat , tilemap , hgmm , mpeak , tilescope , ringo , bac and dsat . however, they are all designed for analyzing one dataset at a time, and the full advantage of data is not exploited when multiple related datasets are available. a recent hierarchical hidden markov model (hhmm) approach developed byallows joint analysis of one chip-chip data and one chip-seq data. this represents a new progress towards using information more efficiently via correlating two types of high-throughput chip experiments. nevertheless, this method does not target analyzing two related chip-chip experiments. more importantly, its current form does not support the analysis of more than two datasets, and it is not easy to generalize the method to handle multiple datasets since its number of parameters grows exponentially when the number of datasets increases. in summary, although jointly analyzing multiple chip-chip datasets is conceptually appealing, currently there is no convenient tool to perform such analysis. here we develop jamie, an r package for joint analysis of multiple chip-chip experiments, to support convenient and efficient mapping of tfbss by jointly analyzing two or more related chip-chip experiments. jamie uses a hierarchical mixture model to capture correlations among datasets. the model provides the basis for sharing information across datasets. its number of parameters grow linearly with the number of datasets. a computationally efficient algorithm is developed to estimate the model parameters. given the estimated parameters, the model is applied to scan the genome and find tfbss. our tests on real data show that by pooling information, jamie improves peak detection over the traditional approach that analyzes individual datasets separately.in summary, we have introduced a novel hierarchical mixture model for jointly analyzing multiple chip-chip datasets. the model was implemented using an efficient algorithm jamie. our simulation and real data analyses showed that by sharing information across data, jamie can improve the analysis of multiple correlated chipchip datasets. the well-controlled comparison between jamie pooling and jamie single showed that the improvement can be consistently observed in different test data, and it can be substantial in datasets with low signal-to-noise ratio. in our tests, jamie was also compared with two other popular chip-chip peak detection methods. unlike the comparison between jamie pooling and jamie single, these additional comparisons were less wellcontrolled in the sense that the observed differences among these algorithms could be attributed to a number of factors. knowing how much each factor contributes to the difference generally is difficult. as a result, these comparisons do not allow one to conclude that joint data analysis is better than separate analysis. from this perspective, the comparison between jamie pooling and jamie single is more informative, as it is able to illustrate a generalizable design principle that can be used to improve future algorithm design. in the past few years, a number of important design principles have been developed for building good chip-chip data analysis algorithms. for example, by using a probe-sequence-dependent
