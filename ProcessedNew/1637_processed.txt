gene expression estimation of fluorescence-tagged rna numbers from spot intensities motivation: present research on gene expression using live cell imaging and fluorescent proteins or tagged rna requires accurate automated methods of quantification of these molecules from the images. here, we propose a novel automated method for classifying pixel intensities of fluorescent spots to rna numbers. results: the method relies on a new model of intensity distributions of tagged rnas, for which we estimated parameter values in maximum likelihood sense from measurement data, and constructed a maximum a posteriori classifier to estimate rna numbers in fluorescent rna spots. we applied the method to estimate the number of tagged rnas in individual live escherichia coli cells containing a gene coding for an rna with ms2-gfp binding sites. we tested the method using two constructs, coding for either 96 or 48 binding sites, and obtained similar distributions of rna numbers, showing that the method is adaptive. we further show that the results agree with a method that uses time series data and with quantitative poly-merase chain reaction measurements. lastly, using simulated data, we show that the method is accurate in realistic parameter ranges. this method should, in general, be applicable to live single-cell measurements of low-copy number fluorescence-tagged molecules. availability and implementation: matlab extensions written in c for parameter estimation and finding decision boundaries are available under mozilla public license atthe processes of production and degradation of rna and protein numbers are stochastic, which causes these numbers to differ between individuals and to vary over time in individual cells, even under optimal stable conditions . present measurement techniques to study these processes in live cells rely on the usage of fluorescent proteins , and consequently on fluorescent microscopy and image processing methods, to extract the relevant statistical data. one of the most accurate techniques to quantify gene expression dynamics in vivo consists of tagging target rna molecules with multiple ms2d-gfp proteins, which makes the target rna transcripts visible as bright spots , as soon as these are transcribed . the present method of quantifying the rna numbers in cells or in the fluorescent rna spots relies on a manual selection of the intensity of a single-tagged rna using the histogram of fluorescence intensities . following this selection, this method assumes that the peaks of spots intensities are concentrated at multiples of the expected intensity of a single rna , so as to quantify the number of rna molecules in spots of varying fluorescence intensities. this method of quantification is not optimal for several reasons. first, it relies on human intervention, and the manual selection can have a major effect in the results of the process of counting the rna molecules. this hampers comparison between results because the selection of the intensity of the first peak varies between users. second, the distribution of the number of rna molecules composing the spots is not uniform, and thus the optimal quantification of these numbers is not achieved by simple rounding. third, the variance in intensities of the spots is expected to increase with the number of tagged rnas composing the spot. fourth, the tagged rna molecules tend to accumulate at the poles of the cells, and one cannot rely on spatial separation between them . lastly, for large datasets, manually assisted quantification can be excessively laborious. here, we propose an automatic method that improves on the rna quantification from fluorescence images. for this, we establish a mathematical model of the intensities, which is free from any assumption on the shape of the distribution of the rnas, as this distribution is the subject of the study. also, we propose methods to estimate the parameters of the model and construct a classifier. we then exemplify the usage of the method in determining the number of rnas in clusters of ms2-gfptagged rna molecules in escherichia coli under various conditions. in particular, we compare results of analyzing cells with one of two target rna constructs that differ in the number of binding sites for ms2-gfp proteins. in addition, the results are compared with a method that uses temporal information for the rna quantification, and results from cells subject to different to whom correspondence should be addressed. levels of induction of target rna are compared with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) measurements. lastly, we study the performance of the classifier on simulated data, whose ground truth is known, and compare it with that of the previous method.
