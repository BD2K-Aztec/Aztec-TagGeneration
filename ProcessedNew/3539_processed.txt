phraider: pattern-hunter based rapid ab initio detection of elementary repeats motivation: transposable elements (tes) and repetitive dna make up a sizable fraction of eukaryotic genomes, and their annotation is crucial to the study of the structure, organization, and evolution of any newly sequenced genome. although repeatmasker and nhmmer are useful for identifying these repeats, they require a pre-compiled repeat librarywhich is not always available. de novo identification tools such as recon, repeatscout or repeatgluer serve to identify tes purely from sequence content, but are either limited by runtimes that prohibit whole-genome use or degrade in quality in the presence of substitutions that disrupt the sequence patterns. results: phraider is a de novo te identification tool that address the issues of excessive runtime without sacrificing sensitivity as compared to competing tools. the underlying model is a new definition of elementary repeats that incorporates the patternhunter spaced seed model, allowing for greater sensitivity in the presence of genomic substitutions. as compared with the premier tool in the literature, repeatscout, phraider shows an average 10 speedup on any single human chromosome and has the ability to process the whole human genome in just over three hours. here we discuss the tool, the theoretical model underlying the tool, and the results demonstrating its effectiveness. availability and implementation: phraider is an open source tool available from https://github. com/karroje/phraider.transposable elements (tes) are genomic sequences that had (or have) the capacity to insert themselves, or copies of themselves, into other genomic locations. present in almost every higher order genome, and covering as much as 45 of the human genome and 90 of the maize genome , tes have proved an important source of data in numerous studies of genomic structure . they are also frequently a source of noise that needs to be masked. unfiltered tes can disrupt annotation tools, resulting in large false positive rates when subjected to automated gene finding tools, as well as inflated runtimes for the annotation tools . the most commonly used tools for repetitive dna identification, such as repeatmasker and nhmmer , use precompiled descriptions of sequences in the family (e.g. an ancestral sequence or profile hmm) to aid in the identification of more instances of that family. but much like the question how does the snow plow driver get to work? , we might ask how these libraries are compiled. repeatmasker requires these libraries to work, but we cannot use repeatmasker to generate them. initial libraries were compiled as a result of wet-lab work, using tes identified through sequencing and biological study . in the era of bioinformatics, we would prefer an automated solution. when first examining a newly sequenced genome we can frequently rely on a library already compiled for a closely related genome, if such a genome has already been sequenced and annotated. within mammals this works well, as such genomes are usually available. in plants we are less likely to find a well-sequenced organism of sufficiently close evolutionary distance to be of use. for example, a rice-based te library will only lead to the identification of 25 of the tes in thephraider is a new tool for the de novo identification of genome repeat elements that is applicable to assembled genomes. we have empirically demonstrated that it is orders of magnitude faster than the premier tool in the literature (repeatscout) yet still improves on that tools ability to mask out tes and other genomic repeats. specifically: we have developed a formal mathematical model combining the concept of spaced seeds with that of elementary repeats; in addition we have implemented a tool around this model, and we have used that tool to demonstrate that: i. the identification of elementary repeats is useful in the context of de novo repeat masking. ii. the introduction of spaced seeds improves results without significant adverse effects on runtime. iii. the resulting tool produces results of a quality on par with the leading tool in the literature but works at a speed significantly faster (with an average 10 speedup over repeatscout for the human chromosome). we have produced a freely available implementation of phraider distributed from https://github.com/karroje/phraider under the gnu general public license (version 3). all code is implemented in c and tested on os x and various flavors of linux. the tool will provide a list of elementary repeats with the coordinates of each instance, and will optionally produce a masked genomic sequence. phraider is the first step towards a full identification tool for tes and repetitive dna, but leaves considerable room for improvements. the use of multiple spaced seeds has been highly successful in other applications and we are in the process of implementing thisbut doing so requires modifications to both the algorithm and the underlying theoretical model, and is beyond the scope of this work. we are also developing tools to aid in seed selection, and to assemble elementary repeats into contiguous testhus implicitly addressing the problems with indels as well. preliminary tests indicate that this last improvement, while not significantly increasing computation time, will considerably improve phraiders performance in generating repeatmasker libraries. i214 c.e.
