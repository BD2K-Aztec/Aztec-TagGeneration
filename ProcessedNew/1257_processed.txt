dasty3, a web framework for das motivation: dasty3 is a highly interactive and extensible web-based framework. it provides a rich application programming interface upon which it is possible to develop specialized clients capable of retrieving information from das sources as well as from data providers not using the das protocol. dasty3 provides significant improvements on previous web-based frameworks and is implemented using the 1.6 das specification. availability: dasty3 is an open-source tool freely available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/dasty/ under the terms of the gnu general public license. source and documentation can be found atthe distributed annotation system (das) defines a communication protocol used to exchange annotations on genomic or protein sequences . implicit in the conception of das is the notion of decentralization; annotations should not be provided by single centralized databases, but should instead be spread over multiple sites. das relies on clientserver architecture; das servers manage data distribution by following a standard protocol, while manipulation and visualization are on the client side thus facilitating the development of tailored tools addressing specific requirements. several clients are available; for instance, spice is a browser that displays protein sequences, structures and their corresponding annotations. another client, dasty2, provides a web-based interface that facilitates visualizing and comparing protein sequence annotations from das servers . these clients are addressing specific needs; however, none of them is providing a framework upon which tools can be built and integrated into a cohesive web environment.dasty3 relies on a modular architecture, which facilitates development of specialized plug-ins. dasty3 like dasty2 is a web-based das client. however, dasty3 is not just a client, but to whom correspondence should be addressed.a platform delivering a rich api over which tailored plug-ins can be built. dasty3 inherits from dasty2 the modularity of its graphical user interface (gui). additionally, it provides a webbased framework for visualizing and manipulating information from das sources as well as other third-party data providers. it facilitates delivering unified views upon which several manipulation facilities can be implemented. it offers a public application programming interface (api) that delivers methods for integrating, visualizing and manipulating data sources.
