databases and ontologies cmap: complement map database the human complement system is increasingly perceived as an intricate protein network of effectors, inhibitors and regulators that drives critical processes in health and disease and extensively communicates with associated physiological pathways ranging from immunity and inflammation to homeostasis and development. a steady stream of experimental data reveals new fascinating connections at a rapid pace; although opening unique opportunities for research discoveries, the comprehensiveness and large diversity of experimental methods, nomenclatures and publication sources renders it highly challenging to keep up with the essential findings. with the complement map database (cmap), we have created a novel and easily accessible research tool to assist the complement community and scientists from related disciplines in exploring the complement network and discovering new connections.cmap is a novel and easily accessible research tool to assist the complement community and scientists from related disciplines in exploring the complement network and discovering new connections. in contrast to many other pathway maps, cmap is tailored to the complement system and its cross-talk with endogenous pathways and exogenous modulators, logically organized according to the hierarchy of the cascade, and entirely based on experimental interaction data that have been reported in scientific journals and reviewed by expert scientists before addition to the database. the user-friendly interface allows easy accessibility and exploration of the site. although offering a highly comprehensive and well-founded overview in its current form, we expect cmap to improve even further with the help of and input from the complement community, thereby truly putting complement on the map for many research disciplines.note: the xmlschema is available at http://www.complement.us/cmap/xml/cmapschema.xsd.
