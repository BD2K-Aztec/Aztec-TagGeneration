data and text mining norse: noise reduction and state evaluator for high-frequency single event traces norse was developed to analyze high-frequency datasets collected from multistate, dynamic experiments, such as molecular adsorption and desorption onto carbon nanotubes. as technology improves sampling frequency, these stochastic datasets become increasingly large with faster dynamic events. more efficient algorithms are needed to accurately locate the unique states in each time trace. norse adapts and optimizes a previously published noise reduction algorithm and uses a custom peak flagging routine to rapidly identify unique event states. the algorithm is explained using experimental data from our lab and its fitting accuracy and efficiency are then shown with a generalized model of stochastic datasets. the algorithm is compared to another recently published state finding algorithm and is found to be 27 times faster and more accurate over 55 of the generalized experimental space. norse is written as an m-file for matlab.as stochastic biological studies are preformed at increasingly smaller length and time scales, the analysis of large, noisy datasets is becoming an increasingly common problem. in our laboratory, these sets consist of time traces gathered from monitoring the fluorescence of single-walled carbon nanotube (swnt)-based sensors. as target molecules bind to a single sensor, the fluorescence is quenched in a stepwise manner , resulting in unique fluorescent states that correspond to the number of bound sites along the length of the nanotube . although norse was created with our fluorescence datasets in mind, the algorithm can be readily applied to other, analogous biological experiments that contain event states. this is demonstrated by an error analysis of generalized stochastic traces as shown below. to whom correspondence should be addressed.
