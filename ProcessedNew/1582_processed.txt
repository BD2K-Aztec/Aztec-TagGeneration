sequence analysis enrich: software for analysis of protein function by enrichment and depletion of variants measuring the consequences of mutation in proteins is critical to understanding their function. these measurements are essential in such applications as protein engineering, drug development, protein design and genome sequence analysis. recently, high-throughput sequencing has been coupled to assays of protein activity, enabling the analysis of large numbers of mutations in parallel. we present enrich, a tool for analyzing such deep mutational scanning data. enrich identifies all unique variants (mutants) of a protein in high-throughput sequencing datasets and can correct for sequencing errors using overlapping paired-end reads. enrich uses the frequency of each variant before and after selection to calculate an enrichment ratio, which is used to estimate fitness. enrich provides an interactive interface to guide users. it generates user-accessible output for downstream analyses as well as several visualizations of the effects of mutation on function, thereby allowing the user to rapidly quantify and comprehend sequencefunction relationships.understanding how variations in protein sequence relate to function is of fundamental importance. measurement of protein activity is critical to engineer protein function, to understand how mutations relate to disease and to gain insight into catalytic mechanisms . efforts to parallelize measurement of protein activity rely on selection for a desired function present within a library of variants of a protein of interest using a display-based system that directly links a proteins activity to its encoding dna sequence . selection for function (e.g. ligand binding, catalytic activity or stability) alters the population of displayed proteins, and thus their associated dna molecules. dna sequences encoding highly functional variants
