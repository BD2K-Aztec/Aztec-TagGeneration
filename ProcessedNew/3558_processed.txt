picante: r tools for integrating phylogenies and ecology picante is a software package that provides a comprehensive set of tools for analyzing the phylogenetic and trait diversity of ecological communities. the package calculates phylogenetic diversity metrics, performs trait comparative analyses, manipulates phenotypic and phylogenetic data, and performs tests for phylogenetic signal in trait distributions, community structure and species interactions. availability: picante is a package for the r statistical language and environment written in r and c, released under a gpl v2 open-source license, and freely available on the web (http://picante .r-forge.r-project.org) and from cran (http://cran.r-project.org).incorporating phylogenetic information into ecology is enlightening because it allows ecological questions to be addressed in an evolutionary context, leading to a deeper understanding of the processes that give rise to patterns of biological diversity . ecophylogenetic research also has numerous applications such as designating conservation priorities, predicting species invasiveness and estimating the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning . in this rapidly expanding field, two barriers have prevented ecologists from incorporating phylogenetic information into their own work. first, many ecophylogenetic methods are not available in open-source software packages, preventing end-users from modifying methods to suit their own purposes. second, the available tools are implemented in multiple software packages, each with unique learning curves and data formatting requirements. here, we describe a software package designed to overcome these limitations by implementing the most commonly used ecophylogenetics tools in a single open-source software package for the r statistical language and environment (r development core). to whom correspondence should be addressed.
