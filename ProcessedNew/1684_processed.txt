genome analysis expands: expanding ploidy and allele frequency on nested subpopulations motivation: several cancer types consist of multiple genetically and phenotypically distinct subpopulations. the underlying mechanism for this intra-tumoral heterogeneity can be explained by the clonal evolution model, whereby growth advantageous mutations cause the expansion of cancer cell subclones. the recurrent phenotype of many cancers may be a consequence of these coexisting subpopula-tions responding unequally to therapies. methods to computationally infer tumor evolution and subpopulation diversity are emerging and they hold the promise to improve the understanding of genetic and molecular determinants of recurrence. results: to address cellular subpopulation dynamics within human tumors, we developed a bioinformatic method, expands. it estimates the proportion of cells harboring specific mutations in a tumor. by modeling cellular frequencies as probability distributions, expands predicts mutations that accumulate in a cell before its clonal expansion. we assessed the performance of expands on one whole genome sequenced breast cancer and performed sp analyses on 118 glioblast-oma multiforme samples obtained from tcga. our results inform about the extent of subclonal diversity in primary glioblastoma, subpopulation dynamics during recurrence and provide a set of candidate genes mutated in the most well-adapted subpopulations. in summary, expands predicts tumor purity and subclonal composition from sequencing data. availability and implementation: expands is available for down-load atthe clonal evolution model initially proposed by peter c. nowell posits that a single cell of origin or clone that underwent transformation from a normal to a cancerous state undergoes clonal expansion and through successive acquisition of mutations generates genetically diverse subclones . subsequent pressure from the cancer microenvironment selects the fittest subclone(s), driving their expansion into subpopulations (sps). as a consequence, the resulting neoplasm is composed of multiple genetically diverse sps that are best adapted to their microenvironment. cancer therapies are hypothesized to eliminate some but not all sps within a tumor, resulting in altered sp composition of tumors that recur post-treatment . a better understanding of the sp composition and dynamics of individual tumors is expected to have significant clinical implications especially for highly recurrent and therapy resistant tumors. glioblastoma (gbm), a grade iv astrocytoma, is the most common cns tumor in adults. despite aggressive standard therapy, consisting of surgery, radiation and adjuvant chemotherapy with the dna alkylating drug temozolomide , gbm invariably recur within months following initial diagnosis and typically become resistant to the first line therapy they have been exposed . an sp with stem-like properties, the cancer stem cells, is one potential culprit for recurrence and therapy resistance in gbm . gbm exhibit substantial subclonal diversity as evidenced by previous comparative genomic hybridization (cgh) analyses , fluorescence in situ hybridization studies and areal sampling of surgical tissue followed by molecular analyses . moreover, heterogeneity within gbm is maintained by crosstalk between genetically distinct tumor cell sps . however, genome-wide analyses of intra-tumoral to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2013. published by oxford university press. this is an open access

acute lymphoblastic leukemia single cells are difficult to perform for solid tumors that are a tight mix of distinct sps and various fractions of non-neoplastic cells. knowing the purity of a tumor sample is important to determine sample quality and to adjust parameters during copy-number estimation and detection of somatic mutations. the advances in next-generation sequencing (ngs) technologies provide emerging tools for computational methods to overcome those hurdles. absolute for example is an analytic method that predicts tumor purity and the distribution of mutations within the tumor from exome sequencing data . the inferences made by absolute do not include the number of tumor sps and the size of each sp in the tumor bulk. these are, however, desirable parameters when quantifying genetic heterogeneity, an emerging biomarker for clinical outcome . shah et al. have developed another bioinformatic approach to predict the number and distribution of subclones from deepsequenced selected mutated genes and to infer the clonal evolution of triple negative breast cancer . by this method, two sps with the same mutation in the region that was deep sequenced would be indistinguishable even if greatly divergent in other areas of the genome. this approach further relies on prior knowledge or hypotheses regarding genes of interest and does not allow for unbiased exploration of the cancer genome. nik-zainal et al. modeled the observed patterns of clonal and subclonal mutations with a hierarchical bayesian dirichlet process . this approach was designed specifically for the mutations detected in the whole genome of a hypermutated breast cancer, sequenced at high coverage (188-fold). the authors inferred a plethora of information about the evolution and subclonal structure of this cancer genome by using various ways to look at the data as described in, yet their combined approaches are not available as one automated method. the resolution of the aforementioned approaches increases with depth of coverage. we propose that the accuracy in the identification of sps is dependent not only on depth of coverage but also on breadth of coverage, i.e. the fraction of nucleotides in the genome sampled by the assay. here we intend to complement existing methods by pairing an unbiased genome-wide sequencing approach with a robust analytic algorithm. we present expanding ploidy and allele-frequency on nested subpopulations (expands), a method that characterizes coexisting sps in a tumor using copy number and allele frequencies derived from exome-or whole genome sequencing input data. the model amplifies the statistical power to detect coexisting genotypes, by fully exploiting run-specific tradeoffs between depth of coverage and breadth of coverage. our results indicate that expands is superior to absolute in predicting tumor purity of highly heterogeneous tumor samples. in addition to tumor purity, expands predicts the number of clonal expansions, the size of the resulting sps in the tumor bulk and the mutations specific to each sp. this information can be useful to identify candidate gene regulators of tumor growth and recurrence.the article outline is as follows: in section 2.12.2, we formulate the problem and describe the expands model. section 2.3 describes the performance of expands on a simulated dataset, data obtained from one previously published whole genome sequenced breast cancer case and 118 tcga gbm exomesequenced samples. section 3 shows how our approach results inform about sp composition in primary gbm and sp changes on recurrence and what genes are mutated in the most welladapted sps. finally, in section 4, we discuss limitations to our method and propose future directions for the approach of tumor mixture separation.
