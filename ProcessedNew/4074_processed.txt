rppanalyzer: analysis of reverse-phase protein array data rppanalyzer is a statistical tool developed to read reverse-phase protein array data, to perform the basic data analysis and to visualize the resulting biological information. the r-package provides different functions to compare protein expression levels of different samples and to normalize the data. implemented plotting functions permit a quality control by monitoring data distribution and signal validity. finally, the data can be visualized in heatmaps, boxplots, time course plots and correlation plots. rppanalyzer is a flexible tool and tolerates a huge variety of different experimental designs. availability: the rppaanalyzer is open source and freely available as an r-package on the cran platform http://cran.r-project.org/in systems biology as well as in biomarker discovery reversephase protein arrays (rppas) have emerged as a useful tool for the large-scale analysis of protein expression and protein activation . the method follows the basic principle of printing large numbers of crude protein extracts in parallel on a solid phase carrier to form a single array. multiple slides are printed in parallel and each (sub)array is probed with a different monospecific antibody. to quantify protein expression or protein activation detectable signals are generated via fluorescence, dye precipitation or chemoluminescence. different methods for calculating and normalizing sample concentrations are available. we implemented this package in the free and open-source r programming environment for statistical computing regarding the fact that r is a widely accepted standard platform for statistical and bioinformatics method exchange (r development core).
