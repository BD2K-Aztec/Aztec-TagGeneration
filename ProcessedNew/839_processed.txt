cafe: a tool for binding affinity prediction using end-point free energy methods accurate prediction of binding free energy is of particular importance to computational biology and structure-based drug design. among those methods for binding affinity predictions, the end-point approaches, such as mm/pbsa and lie, have been widely used because they can achieve a good balance between prediction accuracy and computational cost. here we present an easy-to-use pipeline tool named calculation of free energy (cafe) to conduct mm/pbsa and lie calculations. powered by the vmd and namd programs, cafe is able to handle numerous static coordinate and molecular dynamics trajectory file formats generated by different molecular simulation packages and supports various force field parameters. availability and implementation: cafe source code and documentation are freely available under the gnu general public license via github at https://github.com/huiliucode/cafe_plugin. it is a vmd plugin written in tcl and the usage is platform-independent.accurate estimation of binding affinity (alternatively, binding free energy) is among the most attractive and challenging topics in both computational biology and computer-aided drug design (cadd) . on one hand, noncovalent association is ubiquitous and essential in the cell machinery. it is involved in the processes of enzymatic catalysis, signal transduction, molecular recognition and receptor activation. knowledge of the thermodynamic basis of association at the molecular level provides insights into the underlying mechanisms of various biological phenomena. on the other hand, from a pharmaceutical point of view, the major goal of drug design and discovery is to identify new chemical entities with high affinity to a certain pharmaceutical target. obviously, these research fields would benefit from reliable methods for estimating binding affinity. a number of computational methods have been proposed to predict binding free energy. there are some theoretically rigorous ones based on statistical mechanics; however, these methods are timeconsuming and thus their applications in real-life cadd are limited. another kind of approaches frequently used is so-called scoring functions. they are often embedded in molecular docking programs, for which simplicity and speed are generally required; however, it usually comes with the loss of accuracy. the third type of free energy prediction methods is referred to as end-point methods, which sample conformations only with the free and bound states and get binding free energy by taking a difference between these states. these methods can reach a good balance between accuracy and efficiency .the results are shown inand e. both methods show high correlation coefficients with experimental values in the showcased example, which is in line with our previous evaluations using different force field parameters .to facilitate the prediction of binding affinity of proteinprotein/ligand, we present an automated tool cafe, which provides a userfriendly choice for researchers who want to perform a post-md energetic analysis using the end-point methods.
