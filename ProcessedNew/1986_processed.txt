systems biology gene set analysis in the cloud cloud computing offers low cost and highly flexible opportunities in bioinformatics. its potential has already been demonstrated in high-throughput sequence data analysis. pathway-based or gene set analysis of expression data has received relatively less attention. we developed a gene set analysis algorithm for biomarker identification in the cloud. the resulting tool, yunbe, is ready to use on amazon web services. moreover, here we compare its performance to those obtained with desktop and computing cluster solutions. availability and implementation: yunbe is open-source and freely accessible within the amazon elastic mapreduce service at s3nthe complexity and cost associated with recent advances in highthroughput omic technologies have made cloud computing a cost-effective and powerful resource for bioinformatics. existing platforms, such as those offered by amazon web services (aws), provide the computing environment, including cpus, storage, processing memory, networking and operating systems, required to deploy computationally expensive algorithms and applications. such environments allow users to configure and exploit resources on a pay as you use basis . although cloud computing applications are increasingly being made available for high-throughput dna sequencing data, there is a need for publicly available algorithms that can enable other translational biomedical research applications, such as large-scale gene set analysis of expression data . in this context, expression data of thousands of genes are mapped to biologically relevant sets of genes, e.g. curated biological pathways, and differential expression of such gene sets is estimated across phenotypes. the objective of our research is 2-fold: (i) to develop a cloud compute version of a published gene set analysis algorithm ; and (ii) to perform a comparative analysis of performance across different computing platforms.
