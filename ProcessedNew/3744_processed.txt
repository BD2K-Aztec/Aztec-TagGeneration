structural bioinformatics protein fold recognition using geometric kernel data fusion motivation: various approaches based on features extracted from protein sequences and often machine learning methods have been used in the prediction of protein folds. finding an efficient technique for integrating these different protein features has received increasing attention. in particular, kernel methods are an interesting class of techniques for integrating heterogeneous data. various methods have been proposed to fuse multiple kernels. most techniques for multiple kernel learning focus on learning a convex linear combination of base kernels. in addition to the limitation of linear combinations, working with such approaches could cause a loss of potentially useful information. results: we design several techniques to combine kernel matrices by taking more involved, geometry inspired means of these matrices instead of convex linear combinations. we consider various sequence-based protein features including information extracted directly from position-specific scoring matrices and local sequence alignment. we evaluate our methods for classification on the scop pdb-40d benchmark dataset for protein fold recognition. the best overall accuracy on the protein fold recognition test set obtained by our methods is $86.7. this is an improvement over the results of the best existing approach. moreover, our computational model has been developed by incorporating the functional domain composition of proteins through a hybridization model. it is observed that by using our proposed hybridization model, the protein fold recognition accuracy is further improved to 89.30. furthermore, we investigate the performance of our approach on the protein remote homology detection problem by fusing multiple string kernels. availability and implementation: the matlab code used for our proposed geometric kernel fusion frameworks are publicly available atknowledge on functions of proteins can be provided by information about their tertiary structure; hence, determining this structure is among the most essential objectives in molecular biology, cell biology, proteomics and bioinformatics. structural information also provides a much better understanding of proteinprotein interaction. furthermore, this information is potentially useful for drug design studies. unfortunately, experimentally identifying the 3d structure of proteins is expensive and time-consuming. by contrast, recent development in genome sequencing projects has tremendously increased the number of protein coding sequences. because there is much slower growth in information on 3d structure, there is an increasing gap between the protein sequence information and protein structure information. despite these problems, knowledge about protein folds can be useful in determining its structural properties. because of the limitation of homology modelling methods, when there is no sequence similarity to homologous proteins of known structure, the taxonomic approach is usually considered as a trustworthy alternative. this approach is based on the assumption that the number of protein domain folds is restricted . promising results are reported using taxonomic approaches (;), but they are still far from tackling the classification of protein folds completely. so, fold recognition or protein threading is still among the most challenging tasks in bioinformatics. in many bioinformatics tasks, it is worthwhile to consider several representations of the data, which will not always be vectors. in particular, we should be able to deal with them using the same algorithm, regardless whether they are represented as binary vectors, real vectors on different scales, sequences, graph data, etc. various approaches based on features extracted from protein sequence and often machine learning approaches have been used to tackle the fold recognition problem. several informative fold data sources can be constructed based on various representative models of protein features (pfs), such as primary structural information , local pairwise sequence alignment-based feature spaces , physicochemical properties of constituent amino acids and sequence evolution information . more attention needs to be paid to finding an efficient and cost-effective technique for integrating these different discriminatory data sources for protein fold classification. nevertheless, to deal with biological data, there are not only a lot of issues in machine learning algorithms but also a lot of difficulties in data analysis. full integration and decision integration are common techniques for fusing protein fold data sources. in particular, full integration is a fast and easy way to fuse data sources. however, because of heterogeneity of the to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this is an open access

is not always feasible in practice. by contrast, fusing data sources at decision level, such as in the ensemble learning framework, is considered as an intuitive manner to deal with heterogeneous data. various decision-based integration approaches have been proposed for protein fold classification . in addition to limitations of using ad hoc ensemble learning, the computational cost of decision-based approaches increases corresponding to the number of data sources. the heterogeneous biological data sources can also be integrated intelligently using partial integration, such as kernelbased data fusion. using kernel methods is an elegant and versatile strategy because it decouples the original data from the machine learning algorithms by using a representation of the data as a kernel matrix. the main idea behind kernel methods is, rather than using original data directly, to use only a kernel matrix. symmetric positive definite (spd) kernel matrices are the non-linear extension of covariance/correlation matrices and encode the similarity between samples in their respective input space. this implies that the heterogeneous data (binary vectors, real vectors on different scales, graph data) can all be replaced by appropriately scaled kernel matrices, which all have the same size, and thus that the data heterogeneity disappears. then other algorithms (such as classification, clustering and prioritization) can access the same data, which is currently not possible. constructing the same representation for all datasets and integrating these representations systematically is the main intuition behind kernel fusion methods. in the simplest scenario, we can compute kernel matrices separately for each data source and then average them together. the standard approach for combining kernel matrices is to take the (weighted) arithmetic average. there are several methods for obtaining a valid and fitting kernel by tuning the kernel matrices weights (gonen). finding such weights from training data and replacing the single kernel by a linear combination of weighted base kernels is usually referred to as multiple kernel learning (mkl). these weights can also be interpreted as their corresponding importance in the fused kernel. during the past decades, several mkl methods have been proposed in the literature and are shown to yield good results in various applications, in particular in bioinformatics applications . most of these approaches try to learn a linear combination of base kernels, which can be interpreted as the concatenation of the base kernel feature space or an or combination of the individual kernels. the kernel integration problem is often reduced to a convex optimization problem. in addition to the limitation of linear combinations, solving this optimization problem is only possible for a small number of kernels and small number of data points. furthermore, because this type of averaging is often sensitive to deal with complementary and noisy kernels, it is not appropriate for biological data. in fact, going with such approaches could cause a loss of potentially useful latent information in the data. recent biological applications have demonstrated that even using uniformly weighted kernel integration can boost the generalization capability of the decision function . by contrast, the results obtained by using such averaging of the kernel matrices are comparable with the results of the best existing mkl approaches in general applications . hence, using the uniformly weighted average of the base kernels can be considered as a reliable and computationally more scalable alternative. uniformly weighted kernel integration can also be considered as the arithmetic mean (am) of kernel matrices, which is always a generator of a valid mercer kernel. similar to the am, other types of means of spd matrices [such as the harmonic mean (hm), log-euclidean mean (logem;) and geometric mean (gm)] result in spd kernels. in this study, we propose and develop several new techniques that combine the mercer kernel matrices through other types of averaging than convex linear combination. such averaging of the base kernels can be interpreted as a kind of fusion that expresses the non-linear relationship between the individual kernels. in particular, we focus on taking the matrix gm of base kernels. however, computing the gm of a general number of spd matrices is a challenge. in fact, for a general number of spd matrices, a proper definition of a gm with some natural properties has only recently been developed . we present two methods for computing the gm. the first approach is focused on computing the actual gm using the definition of the karcher mean . the second, however, only computes a rough approximation of the actual gm using a proposed heuristic method based on arithmetic-geometric-harmonic (agh) mean. we show in the second section that it is a computationally scalable method for computing an approximate gm. we also consider the behaviour of combining kernels by taking hm and log-em, where this last one can be seen as a consensus between the am and gm. moreover, our computational model has been developed by incorporating the functional domain information through the hybridization model. experimental results on the scop pdb-40d benchmark dataset demonstrate that our integration technique can effectively improve the accuracy of the state-of-the-art kernel fusion model.in this study, we enhance the fold recognition results on the scop pdb-40d benchmark dataset through a novel kernel data fusion framework based on the gm of kernel matrices (gfk). we present two methods (karcher-kf and agh-kf) for computing the gm, where the second one is a computationally scalable method that computes an approximate gm. the experimental results demonstrate that the gm of kernel matrices can effectively improve the accuracy of the state-ofthe-art kernel fusion model. in addition, we obtain similar results using the logem, which is a more cost-effective technique for integrating different pfs. our meta-predictor is developed by incorporating the available knowledge on functions of protein domains into our kernel data fusion framework, giving a promising total accuracy of 89.30. understanding the relationship between primary and tertiary structure in proteins is one of the main objectives of protein sequence analysis. this relation is still elusive, but our results suggest that combining the evolutionary and secondary structural information could be crucial to elucidate such a latent link. this claim is investigated on the newer scop database (version 1.75;), where our new methods again have good performance. in addition, by incorporating the available functional domain information using our fungeofold model, nearly exact protein fold recognition for 27-folds is achieved. furthermore, the limitation of convex linear combinations in dealing with fusion of different pfs that carry complementary information is considered. our proposed fusion frameworks, by contrast, can be used to detect these features with complementary information, which provides an insightful approach for fusing different features of other problems in bioinformatics.
