sequel: improving the accuracy of genome assemblies motivation: assemblies of next-generation sequencing (ngs) data, although accurate, still contain a substantial number of errors that need to be corrected after the assembly process. we develop sequel, a tool that corrects errors (i.e. insertions, deletions and substitution errors) in the assembled contigs. fundamental to the algorithm behind sequel is the positional de bruijn graph, a graph structure that models k-mers within reads while incorporating the approximate positions of reads into the model. results: sequel reduced the number of small insertions and deletions in the assemblies of standard multi-cell escherichia coli data by almost half, and corrected between 30 and 94 of the substitution errors. further, we show sequel is imperative to improving single-cell assembly, which is inherently more challenging due to higher error rates and non-uniform coverage; over half of the small indels, and substitution errors in the single-cell assemblies were corrected. we apply sequel to the recently assembled deltaproteobacterium sar324 genome, which is the first bacterial genome with a comprehensive single-cell genome assembly, and make over 800 changes (insertions, deletions and substitutions) to refine this assembly. availability: sequel can be used as a post-processing step in combination with any ngs assembler and is freely available atthe advent of next-generation sequencing (ngs) technologies, along with the development of new assembly algorithms has enabled the production of genome assemblies for a multitude of organisms at ever-decreasing costs . robust assembly methods are imperative to the success of large de novo sequencing initiatives, such as the genome 10k project that aims to sequence the genomes of 10 000 vertebrate species (genome 10k community of) and the ik5 project where the objective is to sequence the genomes of 5 000 arthropods . ngs technologies produce short sequence reads [approximately 100150 base pairs (bp) for illumina technology] at increasingly high throughput, permitting assembly methods suited to these technologies to exploit the redundancy in the data in order to produce high-quality contigs . although these platforms have much higher throughput than sanger sequencing platforms, assessment of short-read assemblies have shown them to be less accurate than the the authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first two authors should be regarded as joint first authors. to whom correspondence should be addressed.finished genomes assembled using the previous technologies . earlier assembly algorithms developed for sanger sequencing follow an overlap-layout-consensus paradigm, where consensus refers to fixing errors in the contigs . since this paradigm faces difficulties in short-read assembly, most ngs assemblers employ a de bruijn graph approach that effectively deals with large amounts of data. however, most ngs assemblers neglect the consensus step, i.e. there exists no post-processing of the contigs in velvet and many other popular assemblers. relying on high and uniform coverage, ngs assembly algorithms push the burden of producing high-quality assemblies onto the construction of the de bruijn graph. we argue that ngs assemblers can benefit from the use of a consensus step, particularly in the case of single-cell data that suffers from high error rates and non-uniform coverage . in the spirit of the consensus step, we propose an additional step to the ngs assembly process: refinement. we develop sequel, a tool that refines an initial assembly of short-read data by using approximate positions of reads in contigs. sequel takes as input an assembled contig, the paired-end reads that align to that contig and the approximate positions where they aligned, and returns a refined contig. we refer to the process implemented by sequel as positional reassembly. in eulerian assembly , a de bruijn graph is constructed with a vertex v for every (k 1)-mer present in a set of reads, and an edge (v,v ) for every observed k-mer in the reads with (k 1)-mer prefix v and (k 1)-mer suffix v. a contig corresponds to a non-branching path through this graph. seefor a more thorough explanation of de bruijn graphs and their use in assembly. euler-sr , velvet , soapdenovo , abyss and allpaths all use this paradigm for assembly. most existing ngs assemblers follow the same general outline: break the (possibly error corrected) reads into k-mers, construct the de bruijn graph on the set of resulting k-mers, simplify the de bruijn graph, resolve repeats by using matepair information and construct contigs. although the implementation of these steps varies widely between different assemblers, existing ngs assemblers return contigs recovered from the de bruijn graph with little refinement. if every position in the genome was uniformly covered by errorfree reads, and the genome had few repeats, this would result in a simple de bruijn graph. however, sequencing errors and repeats lead to highly complex graphs and force assemblers to rely on graph simplification. it is during this simplification process that errors in the assembly are introduced. substitution errors and indels in the reads create undirected cycles called bulges and short tandem repeats lead to directed cycles called whirls . there exist numerous methods for removing bulges and whirls sequel. an example of a bulge on eight vertices in a de bruijn graph (k = 4) resulting from a sequencing error. during the process of bulge removal, the correct path (top: cct-cta-tag-agg-gga) may be discarded, thus creating a substitution error in the final contig. this may occur if, for example, coverage is taken as a consideration, since the bottom path (cct-ctt-ttgtgg-gga), erroneous in this case, may have higher coverage due to k-mers originating from other parts of the genome but unfortunately, these methods potentially introduce errors in the contigs.illustrates a scenario where a bulge in the de bruijn graph is caused due to a sequencing error. error correction of the reads prior to assembly can greatly simplify the assembly process by implicitly eliminating bulges from the de bruijn graph . it is now established as a common pre-processing step before assembly, and used by several ngs assemblers, including euler-sr , abyss and allpaths . although error correction eliminates the majority of errors in reads, in 1 of the cases it introduces, rather than corrects, errors . this leads to the following trade-off in fragment assembly: either error correction of reads is performed, which may lead to errors in the contigs, or error correction is not performed and the complex de bruijn graph has to undergo aggressive simplification that may lead to errors in the contigs. it is clear, however, that in both cases subtle and complex errors will arise. the accuracy of different assemblers varies widely. for example, our tests of velvet produced contigs with 12 errors per 100 kb (for k-mer size 55), while soapdenovo produced contigs with 2030 errors per 100 kb. even the accuracy of velvet deteriorates greatly when used in default mode with k-mer size 31. however, soapdenovo has some advantages over velvet (e.g. the ability to handle larger genomes). therefore, it is beneficial to design a refinement program that can be used in combination with any assembler. decoupling the contig refinement problem from the assembly process removes the burden of re-implementing a positional reassembly process for each assembler. we show that ngs assemblies suffer from indels and substitution errors that are somewhat masked by common metrics for assessing assembly quality. many of these errors can be corrected using sequel. we give an analysis of the types of complex errors that occur in ngs assembly, and that can be fixed by sequel, offering some insight into why positional reassembly is a necessity for obtaining accurate assemblies. we give a computational problem formulation for correcting errors in contigs, and present an algorithm for reassembly based on a graph structure referred to as the positional de bruijn graph. we demonstrate the ability of sequel to improve the accuracy of assemblies generated from three assemblers: euler-sr , velvet and velvet-sc . euler-sr performs error correction on the sequence reads prior to assembly , whereas velvet does not perform error correction . velvet-sc is a specialized assembler tailored to handle the dramatic fluctuations in coverage that are characteristic to single-cell data . single-cell amplified dna has been shown to suffer from amplification bias and low template quality , resulting in sequence data with highly non-uniform coverage by error-prone reads . thus, assembly of such data is inherently more challenging and error-prone. our experiments demonstrate that sequel is able to substantially reduce the number of errors in single-cell, and standard (multi-cell) assembly. although we demonstrate the use of sequel with euler-sr, velvet and velvet-sc, its use is not limited to these assemblers.
