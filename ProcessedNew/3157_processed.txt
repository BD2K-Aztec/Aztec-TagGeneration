data and text mining multi-platform segmentation for joint detection of copy number variants motivation: with the expansion of whole-genome studies, there is rapid evolution of genotyping platforms. this leads to practical issues such as upgrading of genotyping equipment which often results in research groups having data from different platforms for the same samples. while having more data can potentially yield more accurate copy-number estimates, combining such data is not straightforward as different platforms show different degrees of attenuation of the true copy-number or different noise characteristics and marker panels. currently, there is still a relative lack of procedures for combining information from different platforms. results: we develop a method, called mpss, based on a correlated random-effect model for the unobserved patterns and extend the robust smooth segmentation approach to the multiple-platform scenario. we also propose an objective criterion for discrete segmentation required for downstream analyses. for each identified segment, the software reports a p-value to indicate the likelihood of the segment being a true cnv. from the analyses of real and simulated data, we show that mpss has better operating characteristics when compared to single-platform methods, and have substantially higher sensitivity compared to an existing multiplatform method. availability: the methods are implemented in an r package mpss, and the source is available from http://www.meb.ki.se/yudpaw.copy-number variants (cnvs) are defined as duplications or deletions in the number of copies of a dna segment (larger than 1 kb in length) when compared to a reference genome. currently, common technologies used to detect cnvs include high-density to whom correspondence should be addressed. single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) arrays and comparativegenomic hybridization (cgh) arrays. in recent years, whole-genome studies using commercial genotyping arrays to detect cnvs have been rapidly expanding. with decreasing cost of commercially available platforms and the fast evolution of these platforms, it is not unusual for research groups to have data from multiple platforms for each sample. for example, the cancer genome atlas research network, a joint effort of the national cancer institute (nci) and the national human genome research institute (nhgri) to explore genomic changes involved in human cancers, used agilent 244k, affymetrix snp 6.0 and illumina 550k platforms to measure copy number alterations in its pilot study. our own collaborators, and perhaps many other researchers, collected genotype data using both illumina humanhap300 and humanhap240s arrays for each sample in order to get higher genome coverage. marker density is an important factor for comprehensive and accurate detection of cnvs and their breakpoints, and different platforms have different probe coverage and density; seefor a summary of probe coverage of the different platforms in the different chromosomes. combining data from different platforms can potentially yield more precise and accurate detection of cnvs and its breakpoints. however, combining such data is not straightforward because it is known that estimates from different platforms show different degrees of attenuation of the true copy-number changes as well as different noise characteristics. furthermore, different platforms have different marker panels and molecular assay methods . currently, there is still a relative lack of formal procedures for combining information from different platforms for copy-number calling. most studies with multiple platforms interrogating the same samples process the data from the different platforms independently, then combine the segments in an ad hoc manner. this approach does not fully utilize information from the different platforms, and when the segmented results from the different platforms differ, it is difficult for researchers to come to a consensus in a statistically rigorous manner. one published method, multiple platform circular binary segmentation (mpcbs) , is able to jointly use information from different platforms for cnv calling. the mpcbs method extends the circular binary segmentation (cbs) algorithm by detecting coupled changes in multiple sequences. briefly, it uses a weighted sum of t-statisticswe have described a new method for identifying cnvs by using data from multiple platforms simultaneously. this method allows researchers to come to a formal consensus result when data from different platforms but for the same individuals are available. the model assumes a random-effects parameter that is common to all platforms, meaning that each platform is assumed to have the same underlying copy-number pattern. we also develop an objective method to segment the estimated random effects parameter (which describes the underlying copy-number pattern) into discrete segments. in addition, we provide a method for calculating a p-value associated with a segment of interest. the p-value would indicate how likely that the segment is a deletion/duplication, and is useful for filtering out likely false positives.background correction is needed to make the data from the different platforms comparable; we use a robust smoother that assumes the majority of each chromosome has normal copy-number. while this assumption is likely to be true for germ-line samples, it may not hold for cancer/tumor samples. recently,developed a normalization method to bring data from different platforms to the same scale. the method uses a technique based on principal curves to estimate the normalization functions. this method was tested on data from the cancer genome atlas research network and seems to work well on tumor samples where there is sufficient deletions and duplications in the genome, but we found that it did not work well with the germ-line samples we use. when we performeds normalization on our samples, the correlation in the copy-number estimates between the platforms increased only very slightly after normalization (see supplementaryand). this could be due to insufficient cnvs in the data for the principal curves to be identified. we illustrate the performance of mpss using real and simulated data sets. in the comparisons using real datasets, we show that mpss cnvs has greater amount of overlap with the reference as compared to the other methods. in the comparisons using simulated datasets, we show that the proposed method can achieve high sensitivity and specificity at reasonable noise levels. in general, for all methods, the proportion of overlapping bases with the highly comprehensive cnv map published byis low. however, we believe it is due to the limitation of the snp arrays rather than the inadequacy of the algorithms. this was also noted bywhere the authors investigated and found that in the regions where the reference cnvs lie, both affymetrix and illumina platforms do not have a shift in the intensities and hence the algorithm would not pick out the region as a cnv. moreover, we do not know if the reference list we have used can be considered the gold standard, since it is not likely to have 100 sensitivity and specificity. even sequencing methods only show between 72.2 and 96.5 specificity . the arrival of higher density arrays, for example, the illumina humanomni2.5 and humanomni5 arrays will likely improve the sensitivity of cnv identification. another kind of multiplatform problem arises when there is some stratification of cohorts by chips; for example, if the cases and controls were typed on different chips. differential sensitivity or false positive rates between the platforms will lead to confounding bias in the casecontrol comparisons. the method presented here assumes that the data from the different platforms are available for each individual, hence the algorithm could not address this problem. this is an important and valid concern and warrants further investigations.
