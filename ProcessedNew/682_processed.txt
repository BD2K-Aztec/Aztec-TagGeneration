systems biology bayesian network prior: network analysis of biological data using external knowledge motivation: reverse engineering gi networks from experimental data is a challenging task due to the complex nature of the networks and the noise inherent in the data. one way to overcome these hurdles would be incorporating the vast amounts of external biological knowledge when building interaction networks. we propose a framework where gi networks are learned from experimental data using bayesian networks (bns) and the incorporation of external knowledge is also done via a bn that we call bayesian network prior (bnp). bnp depicts the relation between various evidence types that contribute to the event gene interaction and is used to calculate the probability of a candidate graph (g) in the structure learning process. results: our simulation results on synthetic, simulated and real biological data show that the proposed approach can identify the underlying interaction network with high accuracy even when the prior information is distorted and outperforms existing methods. availability: accompanying bnp software package is freely available for academic use at http://bioe.gene interaction (gi) networks provide insight for understanding the biological mechanisms that explain various phenotypes in health and disease. the inference of gi networks from highthroughput biological data is an important and challenging task in systems biology. throughout the literature, the term gi has been used in a broad sense implying direct and indirect interactions between genes and/or gene products. several machine learning and statistical methods have been proposed for the problem and bayesian network (bn) models have gained popularity for the task of inferring gene networks . because of the complexity of gi networks and the sparse, noisy nature of experimental data, machine learning and statistical methods may lead to poor reconstruction accuracy for the underlying network. one way to overcome this problem would be to incorporate prior biological knowledge when making network inferences using experimental data. due to technological advances in sequencing, microarray, proteomics and related fields, biological and clinical data are being produced at an ever increasing rate. the 2013 database issue of the nucleic acids research journal lists 1512 molecular biology databases, which provide a vast amount of annotated data and meta data that could be used in a systematic way (fernandez-suarez and). bns have a number of features that make them viable candidates for combining prior knowledge and data as bns can deal with uncertainty, avoid over fitting a model to training data, and learn from incomplete datasets. bns handle stochastic events in a probabilistic framework accounting for noise, which results in emphasizing only strong relations in the observed data. furthermore, bns are able to focus on local interactions where each node is directly affected by a relatively small number of nodes and interactions defined by a bn can be related to causal inference . these properties are similarly observed in biological networks justifying the use of bns in exploring pathways in the setting of identifying gi networks using experimental data. learning algorithms for both the structure and parameters of bns have been developed . most of the research on bns has focused on directed acyclic graphs (dags) and static systems with discrete variables and/or linear gaussian models.used bns to generate a causal model of the yeast cell-cycle data using either a model with discretized expression levels (e.g. boolean, or underexpressed/normal/overexpressed), or a linear gaussian model. the latter treats the expression level of a gene as being normally distributed around a mean which is a linear sum of inputs. therefore, rather than true causal relationships, the results may represent co-regulation of genes. accordingly, a method to sample network structures from the posterior distribution with markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) has been introduced . many bn structure learning algorithms are based on heuristic search techniques with the likelihood approximation because of the infeasible computational complexity. these approaches may lead to a false model, as neither the search technique nor the objective functions guarantee the optimal solution. informative priors generated from existing biological information can improve structure learning to get better models to describe the to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author

iteratively detects consensus motifs based on the structure of the estimated network model, then evaluates the network using the result of the motif detection, until the inferred network becomes stable.proposed a framework utilizing gibbs distribution where an energy function was used to evaluate the probability of an edge in the inferred networks.) extended this approach to integrate multiple sources of prior knowledge into dynamic bayesian network (dbn) learning via mcmc sampling. mukherjee and speed (2008) proposed a scheme to incorporate known network features including edges, classes of edges, degree distributions, and sparsity into gene network reconstruction within a bayesian learning framework utilizing mcmc sampling. these studies were limited in the use of external biological knowledge by incorporating only certain features, such as network topology or binding sites in promoter regions. furthermore, in the aforementioned approaches manual curation and/or incorporation of the external knowledge are employed. in this article, we present a framework to incorporate multiple sources of prior knowledge, regardless of its type, into bn learning. the meaning of prior knowledge in our context is the enumeration of pair-wise interactions of genes from biological information sources and the use of this information in bn modeling. the proposed method is fully automatic and does not use likelihood approximations to find the optimal network that explains observed experimental data. we propose a novel framework that uses bn infrastructure itself to incorporate external biological knowledge when learning networks. this infrastructure yields gi information for pairs of genes, which can be used as informative priors to calculate the probability of a candidate graph, g. this information is then incorporated in the networklearning process that tries to identify the most probable graph given data. we provide an open-access web-based implementation of the proposed method at http://bioe.bilgi.edu.tr/bnp. our results indicate that we can successfully reconstruct networks using synthetic data in addition to simulated and real geneexpression data.in this article, we describe a framework to incorporate multiple sources of prior knowledge, regardless of its type, into bayesian network learning. in several studies, the use of prior biological knowledge of the gi network in conjunction with gi data has been suggested to improve the fidelity of network reconstruction. however, existing methods fail to rigorously harness and use the existing wide range of biological information. the proposed bnp model makes inferences about interactions between gene pairs. the model is instantiated each time with the given experimental data to infer whether the gene pair is related or not, represented by a prediction value between 0 and 1. a prior knowledge matrix is populated with prediction values for all combinations of gene pairs. using a proposed energy and informative prior function, the prior knowledge is utilized in learning network structure with the greedy search algorithm in the bn framework. the goal on these applications is to construct gene networks from gi data and a list of genes of interest. we tested
