cas-database: web-based genome-wide guide rna library design for gene knockout screens using crispr-cas9 motivation: crispr-derived rna guided endonucleases (rgens) have been widely used for both gene knockout and knock-in at the level of single or multiple genes. rgens are now available for forward genetic screens at genome scale, but single guide rna (sgrna) selection at this scale is difficult. results: we develop an online tool, cas-database, a genome-wide grna library design tool for cas9 nucleases from streptococcus pyogenes (spcas9). with an easy-to-use web interface, cas-database allows users to select optimal target sequences simply by changing the filtering conditions. furthermore, it provides a powerful way to select multiple optimal target sequences from thousands of genes at once for the creation of a genome-wide library. cas-database also provides a web application programming interface (web api) for advanced bioinformatics users. availability and implementation: free access atrna guided endonucleases (rgens) derived from the type ii clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)-cas (crispr associated) system, an adaptive immune response in bacteria and archaea, have been usefully harnessed in many genome engineering applications such as gene knockout and knock-in in various organisms . recently, a few groups have undertaken genome-wide cas9-mediated genetic screens in human and other mammalian cells. the selection of target sequences is an initial, rate-limiting step in rgen applications. we and other groups have developed a number of web-based online tools or command-line programs for single-guide rna (sgrna) design or off-target site identification . although they are very useful for choosing sgrnas that target one gene, selection of sgrnas at the genome scale is still challenging. previously, two genome-wide databases for spcas9 design have been built conceptually. however, although they are useful for selecting sgrnas that target a small number of genes, neither offers an easy way to select optimal target sequences at once from thousands of genes for genome-wide library construction in a variety of organisms. here we describe cas-database, a web-based genome-wide grna design tool for spcas9 nucleases for genome-scale screening v c the author 2016. published by oxford university press.
