data and text mining classification with correlated features: unreliability of feature ranking and solutions motivation: classification and feature selection of genomics or transcriptomics data is often hampered by the large number of features as compared with the small number of samples available. moreover, features represented by probes that either have similar molecular functions (gene expression analysis) or genomic locations (dna copy number analysis) are highly correlated. classical model selection methods such as penalized logistic regression or random forest become unstable in the presence of high feature correlations. sophisticated penalties such as group lasso or fused lasso can force the models to assign similar weights to correlated features and thus improve model stability and interpretability. in this article, we show that the measures of feature relevance corresponding to the above-mentioned methods are biased such that the weights of the features belonging to groups of correlated features decrease as the sizes of the groups increase, which leads to incorrect model interpretation and misleading feature ranking. results: with simulation experiments, we demonstrate that lasso logistic regression, fused support vector machine, group lasso and random forest models suffer from correlation bias. using simulations, we show that two related methods for group selection based on feature clustering can be used for correcting the correlation bias. these techniques also improve the stability and the accuracy of the baseline models. we apply all methods investigated to a breast cancer and a bladder cancer arraycgh dataset and in order to identify copy number aberrations predictive of tumor phenotype. availability: r code can be found at:the accelerated development of microarrays and, more recently, of high-throughput sequencing techniques affords genome-wide measurements of molecular changes in the cell that have an impact on cancer onset and progression. high-resolution experiments targeting gene expression, dna copy number or dna methylation in tumors can be the basis for discovering patterns predictive of diagnosis, prognosis and therapy selection (; to whom correspondence should be addressed.). machine-learning techniques for classification and feature selection are often used for automated identification of variables associated with particular tumor phenotypes. in this article, we are concerned with two widely discussed aspects of microarray classification: handling high dimensionality and ill conditioning. the high dimensionality of microarray-based experiments contrasting to the small number of samples easily leads to overfitting. regularized linear models such as logistic regression with ridge or lasso penalty are popular solutions to fitting sparse models in which only a small subset of features plays a role. more sophisticated penalties for sparse model selection are discussed by. the problem of ill conditioning refers to the existence of groups of highly correlated features. the high correlations often have a biological basis, for example if the correlated features relate to the same molecular pathway (coregulated genes in expression data), are in close proximity in the genome sequence (neighboring genes in copy number data) or share similar methylation profile (consecutive cpg dinucleotides in cpg islands). methods using simple penalties like lasso typically discard most of the correlated features: only one or a few arbitrary representatives from every group of correlated features enter the model, provided they are relevant for the outcome. as a consequence, the models become unstable: small changes in the training set result in dramatic changes in the selected subset of features. if the purpose of feature selection includes biological interpretation of the model, then stability must be ensured. a successful approach used in many recent articles is that of selection of groups of features. for example, the group lasso model consists of lasso selection of predefined groups of features. the fused support vector machine combines a lasso and a fused penalty for enforcing similar weights on correlated features, this way performing group discovery and group selection simultaneously. another approach to group selection adopted in a large class of methods uses clustering procedures to discover feature groups, compute super features to summarize every cluster and apply feature selection on the set of super features. for example, in, the features are grouped with a hierarchical clustering procedure and the cluster centroids are used for training linear models. the metagene method consists of k-means clustering of the features, followed by computing the principal components of the clusters, called metagenes, which are used for model training.use fuzzy clustering to determine groups of features and then select a limited number of representatives from each cluster for training svm models.search for dense groups ofwe have shown that several widely used classification algorithms can generate misleading feature rankings when the training datasetscontain large groups of correlated features. this can confound model interpretation, since large groups of predictive features can be masked and falsely appear irrelevant. such an effect is likely to occur because variables relating to a biological process or genomic location of high interest (w.r.t. a phenotype) are overrepresented in the probes set of microarray-based experiments. in this article, we have described the correlation bias and have shown that it affects random forest, lasso logistic regression, group lasso and fused svm models. we used two artificial datasets based on linear models to show that the expected importance of the features in a correlated group decreases as the size of the group increases. we also illustrated the correlation bias caused by the combination of fused and lasso penalties by means of a theoretical example, which considers the particular case of two groups of correlated features. we showed that correlation bias can be reduced using a group-selection algorithm which combines feature clustering with any classification method. we tested two methods for estimating the number of clusters, based on a unsupervised (fc) and supervised approach (fc-sup), respectively. we showed using simulated data experiments that fc and fcsup successfully remove the correlation bias, improve the stability of feature importance and increase the accuracy of the baseline methods. fc-sup outperforms fc in terms of accuracy, but fc is faster and has higher stability. the classification of the real data shows that fc dramatically increases the model interpretability and stability of feature importance. moreover, in five out of eight classification tasks, fc improved the accuracy of the baseline models. fc-sup improves the accuracy of the baseline models in six out of eight classification tasks. fc-sup used in combination with lasso logistic regression yields highest accuracy in three out of four cases. using hierarchical clustering of the features and then computing cluster centroids using the average is certainly not the only solution for identifying and summarizing groups of correlated features. depending on the distribution of the features in the sample space, methods using principal component as cluster centroid [as inor even several representatives] may yield better performance.
