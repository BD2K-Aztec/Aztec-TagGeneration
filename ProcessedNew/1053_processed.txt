structural bioinformatics comment on 'protein–protein binding affinity prediction from amino acid sequence' predicting the strength of interactions between globular proteins is a central and important topic in structural bioinformatics . the amino acid sequence represents the chemical bonding in a protein which, along with the solvent, dictates how it folds into an ensemble of thermally accessible states. in turn, structure specifies the strength and identity of its binding partners, by establishing the specific arrangements of intermolecular interactions and the intramolecular strain required to achieve them. in a recent paper, yugandhar and gromiha (2014) claim to be able to circumvent this and predict proteinprotein binding affinities directly from sequence with astounding accuracy. in this letter, we highlight that(1) feature selection by stepwise regression is applied without employing an information criterion, y-scrambling or regularization, and the method is not validated using an outer cross-validation loop or external validation set.(2) the reported energy functions contain many terms that are functionally unrelated to binding.(3) the reported prediction errors are significantly lower than experimental errors in the training set and variations due to environmental factors.(4) when an external test set is used, predicted affinities have a correlation of approximately zero with experimental data.
