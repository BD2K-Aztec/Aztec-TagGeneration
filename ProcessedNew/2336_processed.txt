identifying viral integration sites using seqmap 2.0 retroviral integration has been implicated in several biomedical applications, including identification of cancer-associated genes and malignant transformation in gene therapy clinical trials. we introduce an efficient and scalable method for fast identification of viral vector integration sites from long read high-throughput sequencing. individual sequence reads are masked to remove non-genomic sequence, aligned to the host genome and assembled into contiguous fragments used to pinpoint the position of integration. availability and implementation: the method is implemented in a publicly accessible web server platform, seqmap 2.0, containing analysis tools and both private and shared lab workspaces that facilitate collaboration among researchers. available at
