telescoper: de novo assembly of highly repetitive regions motivation: with advances in sequencing technology, it has become faster and cheaper to obtain short-read data from which to assemble genomes. although there has been considerable progress in the field of genome assembly, producing high-quality de novo assemblies from short-reads remains challenging, primarily because of the complex repeat structures found in the genomes of most higher organisms. the telomeric regions of many genomes are particularly difficult to assemble, though much could be gained from the study of these regions, as their evolution has not been fully characterized and they have been linked to aging. results: in this article, we tackle the problem of assembling highly repetitive regions by developing a novel algorithm that iteratively extends long paths through a series of read-overlap graphs and evaluates them based on a statistical framework. our algorithm, telescoper, uses short-and long-insert libraries in an integrated way throughout the assembly process. results on real and simulated data demonstrate that our approach can effectively resolve much of the complex repeat structures found in the telomeres of yeast genomes, especially when longer long-insert libraries are used.recent advances in high-throughput sequencing (hts) technologies have dramatically reduced the cost of producing reference genomes for new species and characterizing whole-genome variations in multiple individuals of a population. however, the assemblies produced by current algorithms are often incomplete.report that a de novo shotgun assembly of the human genome using short-reads is 16 shorter than the reference assembled using more laborious means, and that 1 of segmental duplications are represented. indeed, it is well recognized that there is room for better algorithmic use of the data, especially for repetitive regions, which are one of the primary challenges in assembly. telomeres are particularly complex and repetitive, and thus very difficult to assemble correctly. not only does each telomere contain repeats within itself, but often telomeres on different chromosomes are very similar. existing assembly algorithms thus frequently fail to assemble telomeric regions from short-read data. due to this lack of complete assembly, telomere evolution has not been fully characterized, though a great deal is to be gained from it, as telomeres have been linked to ageing . high-quality to whom correspondence should be addressed.telomere assemblies could help us learn more about the variation in telomeres within and between species. in addition, characterizing telomere gene families and their regulation could help us clarify the function of telomeres and how they change as we age. genome assembly is the challenge of piecing together reads to reconstruct the original genome. reads are obtained from various technologies, with varying read length, error rates and coverage. sanger-chemistry reads range in length from around 500 to 1000 bases. newer technologies such as illumina, complete genomics , helicos , 454 life sciences , solid and ion torrent provide reads at vastly lower costs for greater throughput, but at the expense of length. initial improvements in assembly from short-read data focused on how to process the sheer quantity of data and how to detect overlaps. the de bruijn graph proved a useful data structure for this purpose and is used by pioneering short-read assemblers such as velvet and euler-usr , and subsequent assemblers including soapdenovo , allpaths 2 , abyss and cortex . many hts platforms produce paired-end or mate-pair reads, which we collectively refer to as read-pairs. the paired nature of these reads constitutes a powerful source of information, significantly facilitating genome assembly. improved use of readpair information lies at the heart of recent works such as allpathslg , the pe-assembler and the paired de bruijn graph , innovations of which are primarily in earlier use of short-insert read-pairs. allpaths-lg requires reads of length around 100 bases sequenced from short fragments of length 180 bp so that, on average, each read-pair overlaps by 20 bases. this means that in general each read-pair can be merged into a single longer read corresponding to the fragment. a drawback of this approach is in the very specific type of data required, which differs from the standard library construction of fragments 300500 bp in size. the pe-assembler builds short stretches in non-repetitive regions first, similar to unitigs (see section 2 for a definition) in a de bruijn graph, and then extends these iteratively using reads with mates that map to the increasing already-assembled portion. (a similar idea is also used infor resequencing with a reference, where insertions are assembled as iterative extensions of existing sequences.) the paired de bruijn graph method entails building a so-called a-bruijn graph in which vertices track pairs of reads instead of single reads, with two vertices being merged only if the merging is consistent with the associated pairs of reads. to our knowledge, this method remains largely theoretical at this time, and it has been tested only on simulated data with perfect reads. a theoretical observation fromis that longer long-insert libraries can substantially improve assembly.we have introduced several new ideas for de novo genome assembly, geared towards highly repetitive regions. our preliminary assembler, telescoper, proceeds by iteratively extending paths and selecting between them using the empirical distributions formed by both longinsert and short-insert paired-end reads. the utility of telescoper was validated in a study on both real and simulated data from the 40 kb telomeric regions of each chromosome of s.cerevisiae. for all three datasets tested, telescoper produced more continuous assemblies than the other algorithms considered. in our evaluations, we tried to include the strongest and most popular algorithms with available implementation. unfortunately, allpaths-lg could not be included, because of its small-fragment library requirement mentioned in section 1. we considered several standard metrics for comparing assemblies, but we note that the task of comparing genome assemblies is a large one, with several papers exclusively devoted to it . other researchers are currently working on algorithms for identifying assembly errors using features derived from read mapping. rather than having this be a downstream process, we believe that it would help to incorporate such features directly into an assembly algorithm. here, we make an effort in this direction by scoring assembly extensions according to read-mapping statistics. although the scoring scheme used in this article may not be optimal, we have demonstrated that the idea of simultaneously pursuing multiple extensions, and concurrently using multiple libraries to score and select among them is promising. the current implementation of telescoper can be used as a finishing algorithm to extend contigs into repetitive regions and produce better assemblies for telomeres. other applications include targeted de novo assembly of structural variants and highly variant regions such as human leukocyte antigen. future work will include extending the ideas presented here to whole-genome assembly, improving error correction, producing more exhaustive listings of potential paths and more thorough evaluation of the alternate paths. also, additional validation metrics such as those explored bycan be incorporated as well.we often see cases where, if we took the union of all assemblies, we could produce a much better final product. this suggests that assembly is not a solved problem, and that the strengths of different algorithms can potentially be combined to produce better assemblies. we believe the ideas behind telescoper have the potential to improve de novo assembly significantly and provide a comprehensive picture of previously unresolved repetitive regions.
