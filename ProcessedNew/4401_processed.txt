genome analysis stamp: statistical analysis of taxonomic and functional profiles stamp is a graphical software package that provides statistical hypothesis tests and exploratory plots for analysing taxo-nomic and functional profiles. it supports tests for comparing pairs of samples or samples organized into two or more treatment groups. effect sizes and confidence intervals are provided to allow critical assessment of the biological relevancy of test results. a user-friendly graphical interface permits easy exploration of statistical results and generation of publication-quality plots. availability and implementation: stamp is licensed under the gnu gpl. python source code and binaries are available from our website attaxonomic and functional profiles arise in many areas of the biological sciences. statistical hypothesis tests can be used to identify features (e.g. taxa or metabolic pathways) that differ significantly between pairs of profiles or between sets of profiles organized into two or more groups (e.g. sick versus healthy). here we introduce stamp v2, a tool that provides extensive hypothesis testing, exploratory plots, effect size measures and confidence intervals for aiding in the identification of biologically relevant differences. we illustrate the use of stamp on two microbial datasets: (i) taxonomic profiles from coalbed methane (cbm) communities and (ii) functional profiles from photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic cyanobacteria.
