systems biology drugâ€“target interaction prediction by learning from local information and neighbors motivation: in silico methods provide efficient ways to predict possible interactions between drugs and targets. supervised learning approach, bipartite local model (blm), has recently been shown to be effective in prediction of drugtarget interactions. however, for drug-candidate compounds or target-candidate proteins that currently have no known interactions available, its pure local model is not able to be learned and hence blm may fail to make correct prediction when involving such kind of new candidates. results: we present a simple procedure called neighbor-based interaction-profile inferring (nii) and integrate it into the existing blm method to handle the new candidate problem. specifically, the inferred interaction profile is treated as label information and is used for model learning of new candidates. this functionality is particularly important in practice to find targets for new drug-candidate compounds and identify targeting drugs for new target-candidate proteins.identification of interactions between drugs/compounds and protein targets is an important part of the drug discovery pipeline. the great advances in molecular medicine and the human genome project provide more opportunities to discover unknown associations in the compoundprotein interaction network. the newly discovered interactions are helpful for discovering new drugs by screening candidate compounds and also may help understand the causes of side effects of existing drugs. since experimental way to determine drugtarget interactions is costly and time-consuming, in silico prediction becomes a potential complement that provides useful information in an efficient way. generally, the prediction performance is decided by both the data used and the particular analysis method that is applied to. an intuitive and straightforward way to identify new targets for a drug is to compare the candidate proteins with those existing targets of that drug. different results may be obtained depending on which perspective the comparison is made with respect to.compare targets based on the chemical structure of ligands that bind to them. as reviewed in, the structure of binding sites is another important way to compare proteins or to measure the similarity between proteins. although binding site is an effective measure for identification of new targets, the structures of binding site are only available for a small set of proteins, of which the 3d structures are known. to be able to consider more proteins, amino acid sequence may be used as it is available for most proteins. similarly, to identify new targeting compounds for a specific target, comparison is made on the compound side or drug side with respect to chemical structures , side effects or other possible measurements of drug. more sophisticated statistical and machine learning methods have been developed recently for prediction of genome-wide drugtarget interactions. in, multiple groups of drug-related features and protein-related features have been extracted to describe each drugtarget pair. after feature selection, a certain classifier is used to predict whether a given pair is interacting or not.proposed a supervised bipartite graph learning approach. in this approach, the chemical space and the geometric space are mapped into a unified space so that those interacting drugs and targets are close to each other while those non-interacting drugs and targets are far away from each other. by mapping the query pair of drug and target to that space with the learned mapping function, the probability of interaction between them is then calculated as their closeness in the mapped space. another method called the weighted profile method was also given in. for a query drug, the weighted profile method assigns a probability of interaction to the query target based on how the neighbors of this drug interact with this target. basically, weighted profile is a nearest-neighbor approach and it is called drug-based/targetbased similarity inference in. other than to whom correspondence should be addressed. inferring interactions from the drug similarity or target similarity, network-based inference was also studied in, which infers or predicts drugtarget interactions based on the topology of the known interaction network. different from the work in, which makes use of the drug similarity, target similarity and network-based similarity separately,apply random walk on a heterogeneous network constructed with these three types of similarities. another promising approach is the bipartite local model (blm) approach.showed that the ensemble of independent drug-based prediction and target-based prediction with supervised learning performs much better than only using each single type of prediction. the blm method has been further studied and improved in xia et al. (2010) and laarhoven et al. (2011). the main differences of these three methods include the drugdrug and targettarget similarities, the classifiers and the way used to combine the drug-based and target-based interaction probabilities. in, semi-supervised approach is used instead of supervised approach for local model learning; whilefound that using only the kernel based on the topology of the known interaction network is able to obtain a very good performance. in the existing framework of blm, the model for the query drug or target is learned based on local information, i.e. its own interaction profile. despite a good performance, blm has limitations. it is unable to learn without training data and hence is not able to provide a reasonable prediction for drug/target candidates that are currently new. here, a drug-candidate compound is new if it does not have any known targets, and a target-candidate protein is new if it is not targeted by any drugs/compounds. we call this the new candidate problem of blm. since a large number of compounds and proteins, which are possible drug candidates and target candidates, respectively, are new, in this study, we focus on handling the new candidate problem by proposing an improved version of blm called blm with neighbor-based interaction-profile inferring (blmnii). the nii procedure is developed to incorporate the capacity of learning from neighbors into the original blm method. more specifically, when the query involves a new drug/target candidate, we first derive the initial weighted interactions for the new candidate from its neighbors interaction profiles, and then use the inferred interactions as label information to train the model. in general, neighbors refer to compounds/proteins that have large similarities to the query compound/protein. the presented nii idea happen to be similar to the weighted profile method in some sense. however, our blmnii method is substantially different from the weighted profile method in the following aspects. in blmnii, the derived interaction profile is used as label information to train the local model or the classifier, while in the weighted profile method, the derived weighted interaction is directly used as the final predicted interaction probability. moreover, in blmnii, the nii procedure is integrated into the blm framework where a certain classifier plays the main role in model learning, and nii is activated only for new drug/target candidates; while in the weighted profile method, there is no other classifier and the procedure of deriving the weighted profile acts as a classification process, which is applied for any drug/target candidates. to sum up, the blmnii is an enhanced blm method, and it is different from the weighted profile method, which is a nearest-neighbor approach. our experimental results show that blmnii performs much better than the weighted profile method. systematic experiments are conducted to simulate the task of drugtarget interactions prediction cross four datasets. compared with state-of-the-art approaches, our proposed approach achieves consistent improvement in terms of area under roc (auc) curve and area under precision versus recall (aupr) curve. as these four datasets contain different portions of new drug candidates and target candidates in the simulation, the improvements of blmnii compared with blm are also different for the four datasets. the most significant improvement is achieved on the nuclear receptor dataset, which contains the largest portion of new candidates. this shows that the nii strategy, i.e. to infer label information or training data from neighbors when there is no training data readily available from the query compound/protein itself, is feasible and effective for dealing with the new candidate problem of the original blm.
