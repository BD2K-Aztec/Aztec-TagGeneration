sina: accurate high-throughput multiple sequence alignment of ribosomal rna genes motivation: in the analysis of homologous sequences, computation of multiple sequence alignments (msas) has become a bottleneck. this is especially troublesome for marker genes like the ribosomal rna (rrna) where already millions of sequences are publicly available and individual studies can easily produce hundreds of thousands of new sequences. methods have been developed to cope with such numbers, but further improvements are needed to meet accuracy requirements. results: in this study, we present the silva incremental aligner (sina) used to align the rrna gene databases provided by the silva ribosomal rna project. sina uses a combination of k-mer searching and partial order alignment (poa) to maintain very high alignment accuracy while satisfying high throughput performance demands. sina was evaluated in comparison with the commonly used high throughput msa programs pynast and mothur. the three bralibase iii benchmark msas could be reproduced with 99.3, 97.6 and 96.1 accuracy. a larger benchmark msa comprising 38 772 sequences could be reproduced with 98.9 and 99.3 accuracy using reference msas comprising 1000 and 5000 sequences. sina was able to achieve higher accuracy than pynast and mothur in all performed benchmarks. availability: alignment of up to 500 sequences using the latest silva ssu/lsu ref datasets as reference msa is offered atmultiple sequence alignment (msa) is a core building block in the analysis of biological sequence data. phylogenetic tree reconstruction, structure prediction or hidden markov modeling require msa to infer residue-level homology or structural or functional identity. the ubiquitous need for msa computation has made this field an active research topic with over 100 methods to whom correspondence should be addressed. published in the past 30 years and numerous review papers discussing their relative merits and deficiencies . the dependency of the subsequent analysis methods on the results of the msa stage and the drastic effect differing msas can cause (;) make alignment accuracy the primary benchmark for novel and improved methods. the task of computing the optimal alignment [as determined by the sum-of pairs (sp) score] was shown to be non-deterministic polynomial (np)-complete , and is therefore only feasible for very few sequences. for sets of sequences, comprising several thousand or more sequences, heuristic algorithms are used. the most prevalent algorithms are based on the progressive alignment technique, which builds the msa via a series of pairwise alignments of sequences and partial alignments along the branches of a guide tree. sequence data volumes are growing exponentially. this was already observed almost 20 years ago , and the effect has not diminished since . msa has long been largely unaffected, because the numbers in which homologous gene sequences were available remained low. for many genes, however, this situation is changing. especially frequently sequenced marker genes, such as the ribosomal rna, are rapidly becoming available in volumes exceeding the scalability of traditional alignment techniques. in 2007, the first release of the silva ssu database contained over 353 366 small subunit rrna (ssu) gene sequences . until september 2011, that database grew more than sevenfold to contain 2 494 582 sequences. the two other large rrna databases, greengenes and rdp , are of similar size . the large subunit rrna (lsu), provided only by silva, grew only slightly slower. in 2007, the database contained 46 979 sequences. currently, it contains almost six times as many sequences (269 498). although each of these databases uses a different tool to compute their alignments, the used methods share one important characteristic: rather than computing an alignment de novo, the alignment of each individual sequence is derived from a static reference msa. the reference msa implicitly defines a fixed set of alignment columns into which the bases comprising the query sequence are placed. by avoiding mutual comparisons between the sequences considered for inclusion in the final msa (candidate sequences), the alignment process becomes inherently scalable. furthermore, the msa offered by the database provider can bewe reported the average q scores because they are commonly used as accuracy indicator for sequence alignment. however, the values are not directly comparable to results obtained for de novo methods as these lack the benefit of a guiding reference alignment. given a consistent reference alignment, selecting a reference sequence closely resembling the candidate sequence and transferring the alignment positions of the shared segments suffices to perfectly align those shared segments. the identity between the candidate sequences and the available reference sequences should therefore be considered as a baseline when interpreting the results. this also affects the precision with which accuracy can be measured. as can be seen in, the variance among sampled test cases was extremely low. when considering only those sequences that had an identity with the reference sequences of 80, variance increased by an order of magnitude. we therefore believe that assessing alignment accuracy to a precision of 0.1 is permissible for the benchmarks we performed. in interpreting the results, it may also be more informative to consider error rates, rather than the fraction of correctly aligned bases. for example, pynast achieves 98.55 accuracy (q) on the bralibase 5s rrna dataset, whereas sina achieves 99.23. this amounts to error rates of 1.45 and 0.77, thus sina placed only half as many bases in the wrong columns. because sequence alignment is only one of many sources for error in sequence alignment, the permissible margin of error depends on many factors. we can, however, determine an upper bound at which it is more sensible to forgo extension of the reference msa and instead use a homology search to map candidate sequences to results based solely on the reference msa. in this case, the error would be equivalent to the distance between candidate and best matching reference because both error and distance are measured as a fraction of differing base positions. the average distance may therefore be used as a point of reference for the permissible error. methods expecting a msa as input do not commonly incorporate measures to deal with errors in the msa. they will also make mutual comparisons between the aligned candidate sequences. demanding that the error be at least an order of magnitude lower than the distance therefore seems prudent. according to the ssu benchmark, the distance between candidates and references averages to 7.66 using 1000 reference sequences and 4.76 using 5000 reference sequences. the same benchmark shows error rates for the nast-based methods of above 3.37 and 2.19. in absolute numbers, this means that when using a 5k reference msa, the candidates and their best matching reference sequences where on average distinguished by 71 positions (according to the original alignment). thirty-two positions where misaligned by nast. sina fares much better. at 0.74 error rate ( or 11 misaligned positions), its error was only a third of that produced by pynast and mothur. although the aforementioned order of magnitude difference between error and distance would demand at most seven misaligned positions, we may have reached the resolution of the benchmark. when manually inspecting the positions comprising the error, we found that most cases were related to extensions of homo-polymers, conflicts between primary and secondary structure alignment or inconsistencies in the reference msa. from the silva, rrna gene datasets and the online sina alignment service, both of which having been available for several years now, we were able to gather user feedback on these shortcomings. in general, users stated that the changes they made in manually refining the sina alignment were related to the secondary structure. however, we were unable to collect sufficient problematic sequences in which secondary structure awareness would clearly improve alignment accuracy to build a dataset for benchmarking. we therefore concur with the observation made by kemena that much larger, high quality benchmark msas are needed, especially for improving and evaluating the accuracy of high throughput msa methods. although the dataset extracted from the silva ssu ref database used in the evaluation of sina is of high quality, it is merely a subset of the silva ssu seed. as such, it lacks a representative distribution of distances between sequences and would require further refinement and extension to become a good benchmark. furthermore, a benchmark msa explicitly constructed to comprise fewer columns than a correct alignment demands would be required to test the performance of alternative methods for constraining the number of columns. because we expect that many other genes besides the rnas will soon become available in numbers surpassing what can be feasibly aligned using de novo techniques, we also see a need for advanced interactive tools to support building and curating large msas to be used as benchmark or reference msas. once benchmarks of sufficient resolution at high alignment accuracy levels become available, it may be interesting to investigate whether improving the poa based stage in sina with methods used by de novo msa tools such as infernal, muscle or mafft can further enhance alignment accuracy.we have shown that combining a k-mer distance search with poa incremental msa to integrate candidate sequences into an existing msa yields highly accurate results. using multiple reference sequences as a basis for the alignment of the candidate sequences significantly improves alignment quality. dynamically selecting a low, fixed number of sequences from which the alignment template is constructed rather than basing the alignment on a global template built from all reference sequences allows the use of very large reference msas, lowering the number of bases remaining unaligned because they do not occur in the reference msa. furthermore, suboptimal alignment behaviour for groups of novel candidate sequences can be easily corrected by manually optimizing the alignment of one of these sequences and adding it to the reference msa. with sina, we provide a versatile and flexible tool for accurate high-throughput msa that has proven its reliability and robustness over several years of testing in the context of the silva project.
