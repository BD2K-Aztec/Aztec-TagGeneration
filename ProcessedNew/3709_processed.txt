probabilistic method for detecting copy number variation in a fetal genome using maternal plasma sequencing motivation: the past several years have seen the development of methodologies to identify genomic variation within a fetus through the non-invasive sequencing of maternal blood plasma. these methods are based on the observation that maternal plasma contains a fraction of dna (typically 515) originating from the fetus, and such methodologies have already been used for the detection of whole-chromosome events (aneuploidies), and to a more limited extent for smaller (typically several megabases long) copy number variants (cnvs). results: here we present a probabilistic method for non-invasive analysis of de novo cnvs in fetal genome based on maternal plasma sequencing. our novel method combines three types of information within a unified hidden markov model: the imbalance of allelic ratios at snp positions,until recently, the prenatal analysis of a fetal genome required samples directly obtained from the fetus by invasive procedures like chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis, where amniotic fluid is sampled from around the developing fetus. amniocentesis, however, has several important disadvantages. foremost, it carries a non-trivial risk of miscarriage [estimated procedure-related fetal loss rate is 0.61 (, and hence is refused by a fraction of patients. secondly, amniocentesis cannot be performed too early, as the risk of miscarriage rises significantly, and is typically indicated for the 15th week of pregnancy, outside of the time-frame for the safest abortion options (512 weeks) and leaving only limited time for follow-up analysis. finally, amniocentesis is a complex and expensive medical procedure ($1500$3000). consequently, amniocentesis is typically performed only to confirm or reject a diagnosis if a genetic disease is suspected, e.g. high likelihood of down syndrome based on prenatal ultrasound.the last several years has seen the initial development of alternative, non-invasive methods for prenatal genetic testing. prominent among these are methods that are based on analysis (arrays or sequencing) of cell-free dna (cfdna) extracted from maternal blood plasma, which contains an admixture of fetal and maternal dna. the fraction of fetal dna in such an admixture varies depending on multiple factors, including maternal weight and size of the fetus, but typically builds up from $57 early in the pregnancy to 10 at week 10 to as much as 50 before delivery . in experiments conducted by(and utilized in this article), the estimated admixture in samples obtained at 8 weeks and 18.5 weeks of gestation was 7 and 13, respectively. the decreasing cost of dna sequencing has made it practical to directly sequence cfdna extracted from maternal blood to identify likely genetic disorders present in the fetus. non-invasive methods are becoming more commonly used to directly identify aneuploidies (abnormal chromosome counts) and are also enabling preventive screening for heritable genetic diseases, resulting in better prenatal health care . while most non-invasive genetic diagnostics aim to test for a particular previously known biomarker,demonstrated the possibility of the reconstruction of the whole genome of the fetus by combining whole-genome sequencing of parental genomes with deep sequencing of cfdna from maternal plasma (78 coverage). the key intuition in this method is the comparison of allelic ratios at individual snp loci, as the inheritance of a particular paternal allele affects the percentage of reads with that allele at the particular position in the genome. this method heavily relies on the availability of phased parental genotypes, as these allow for the inference of likely co-inherited snps, leading to an improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio. it consequently provides for high accuracy identification of inherited (98 accuracy) but not de novo single nucleotide variants (17 correct calls out of 44 true de novo sites, with 3884 called positions). while most efforts to detect copy number variants (cnvs) from cfdna sequencing have so far concentrated on wholechromosome events [e.g., the past year has seen the first few attempts at methods for genome-wide identification of sub-chromosomal de novo cnvs. such methods are desired to enable non-invasive prenatal screening for diseases like digeorge syndrome ($3 mb deletion), prader-willi syndrome (the deletion subtype caused by a $4 mb deletion) and other disorders associated with a mid to large sized cnv. so far two manuscripts address the problem of detecting sub-chromosomal cnvs . while the exact methods used in both of these approaches differ, both rely on depth of coverage: they map the reads to the genome, to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative

idea in these methods is that deletions/duplications will result in more/fewer fetal reads within a window, and this difference can be identified using statistical methods.use depth-ofcoverage computed in 1 mb windows across the genome to identify cnvs that are typically 41 mb, though they do report discovery of a 300 kb cnv. nine of the 22 discovered cnvs in 11 patients were concordant with karyotyping results, with most discrepancies being short (51 mb) cnvs. importantly, they use extremely short (25 bp) reads, allowing for larger number of fragments at equal coverage depth.use even larger 10 mb windows, again considering only the number of fragments mapped, and are able to successfully identify variants 929 mb with only one false positive among six true positives in 1311 patients. both methods utilize low coverage wgs of the plasma cfdna, while leveraging the large number of samples. in this manuscript, we introduce a novel model for noninvasive prenatal identification of de novo cnvs with increased sensitivity compared with methods published so far. our method combines three types of information within a unified probabilistic model. first, our method takes advantage of the imbalance of allelic ratios at snp positions that are introduced by various types of paternally and maternally inherited cnvs. secondly, following the work of, we use parental genotypes to phase nearby snps, modelling their co-inheritance (or recombination) and thus improving the signal-to-noise ratio. finally, we observed that allelic ratios poorly differentiate between certain types of cnvs: for example, as further described below, a duplication of a paternally inherited allele results in extremely similar allelic ratios to deletion of a maternally inherited one. we thus combine the allelic ratios with the depthof-coverage signal to better differentiate between such cases. our simulation results, based on in silico introduction of novel cnvs into plasma samples with 13 fetal dna concentration, demonstrate a sensitivity of 90 for cnvs 4400 kb (with 13 calls in an unaffected genome), and 40 for 50400 kb cnvs (with 108 calls in an unaffected genome).
