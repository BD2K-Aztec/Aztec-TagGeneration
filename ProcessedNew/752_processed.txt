genome analysis bioinformatics challenges for personalized medicine motivation: widespread availability of low-cost, full genome sequencing will introduce new challenges for bioinformatics. results: this review outlines recent developments in sequencing technologies and genome analysis methods for application in personalized medicine. new methods are needed in four areas to realize the potential of personalized medicine: (i) processing large-scale robust genomic data; (ii) interpreting the functional effect and the impact of genomic variation; (iii) integrating systems data to relate complex genetic interactions with phenotypes; and (iv) translating these discoveries into medical practice.we are on the verge of the genomic era: doctors and patients will have access to genetic data to customize medical treatment. consumers can already get 500 0001 000 000 variant markers analyzed with associated trait information , and soon full genome sequencing will cost less than $1000 . one group has performed a complete clinical assessment of a patient using a personal genome , and the 1000 genomes project is sequencing 1000 individuals (1000 genomes). in the coming years, the bioinformatics world will be inundated with individual genomic data. this flood of data introduces significant challenges that the bioinformatics community needs to address. this review outlines the developments that led to these challenges, the previous work that can address them and the need for new methods to address them. the challenges fall into four main areas:(i) processing large-scale robust genomic data; (ii) interpreting the functional impacts of genomic variation; (iii) integrating data to relate complex interactions with phenotypes; and (iv) translating these discoveries into medical practices. to whom correspondence should be addressed.
