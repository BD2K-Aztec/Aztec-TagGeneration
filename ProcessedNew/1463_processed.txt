sequence analysis domosaics: software for domain arrangement visualization and domain-centric analysis of proteins domosaics is an application that unifies protein domain annotation, domain arrangement analysis and visualization in a single tool. it simplifies the analysis of protein families by consolidating disjunct procedures based on often inconvenient command-line applications and complex analysis tools. it provides a simple user interface with access to domain annotation services such as interproscan or a local hmmer installation, and can be used to compare , analyze and visualize the evolution of domain architectures. availability and implementation: domosaics is licensed under the apache license, version 2.0, and binaries can be freely obtained from www.domosaics.protein evolution can be treated as a series of domain-wise changes that alter their domain arrangement (or architecture), the sequence of a proteins constituent domains. the majority of novel arrangements can be explained by rearranging domains and processes such as fusion, fission and terminal domain loss are thought to be the primary forces at play . the signatures of domains are stored in specialized domain databases such as pfam , superfamily or interpro . existing tools that exploit domain content for evolutionary analysis focus on specific aspects, primarily the identification of homologous proteins, and are often limited to a single domain definition database. services are either provided in the form of web servers such as d-omix or dahunter (now wdac) , or as standalone applications such as pfamalyzer , nifas or xdom . the recently described tool archschema takes a domain-graph approach to illustrate related domain arrangements. however, none of these tools combine annotation, analysis, search and visualization into a single framework.domosaics collates all steps from domain annotation, homology search, analysis of architectural evolution to creation of customizable publication-ready figures into a single tool.the program can be started directly from the domosaics web page using java web start. alternatively, a precompiled java archive file (jar) can be downloaded. an example dataset and the program documentation are included in the program.
