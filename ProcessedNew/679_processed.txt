bayesian mixture analysis for metagenomic community profiling motivation: deep sequencing of clinical samples is now an established tool for the detection of infectious pathogens, with direct medical applications. the large amount of data generated produces an opportunity to detect species even at very low levels, provided that computational tools can effectively profile the relevant metagenomic communities. data interpretation is complicated by the fact that short sequencing reads can match multiple organisms and by the lack of completeness of existing databases, in particular for viral pathogens. here we present metamix, a bayesian mixture model framework for resolving complex metagenomic mixtures. we show that the use of parallel monte carlo markov chains for the exploration of the species space enables the identification of the set of species most likely to contribute to the mixture. results: we demonstrate the greater accuracy of metamix compared with relevant methods, particularly for profiling complex communities consisting of several related species. we designed metamix specifically for the analysis of deep transcriptome sequencing datasets, with a focus on viral pathogen detection; however, the principles are generally applicable to all types of metage-nomic mixtures. availability and implementation: metamix is implemented as a user friendly r package, freely available on cran: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metamix contact: sofia.morfopoulou.metagenomics can be defined as the study of dna sequences from environmental or community samples, while metatranscriptomics is the analysis of rna sequence data from such samples. the scope of metagenomics/metatranscriptomics is broad and includes the analysis of a diverse set of samples such as gut microbiome , environmental or clinical samples. among these applications, the discovery of viral pathogens is clearly relevant for clinical practice . the traditional process of characterizing a virus through potentially difficult and time consuming culture techniques is being revolutionized by advances in high throughput sequencing. potential benefits of sequence driven methodologies include a more rapid turnaround time , combined with a largely unbiased approach in species detection, including the opportunity for unexpected discoveries. the analysis of shotgun sequencing data from metagenomic mixtures raises complex computational challenges. part of the difficulty stems from the read length limitation of existing deep dnasequencing technologies, an issue compounded by the extensive level of homology across viral and bacterial species. another complication is the divergence of the microbial dna sequences from the publicly available references. as a consequence, the assignment of a sequencing read to a database organism is often unclear. last, the number of reads originating from a disease causing pathogen can be low . the pathogen contribution to the mixture depends on the biological context, the timing of sample extraction v c the author 2015. published by oxford university press.we first applied metamix on a popular benchmark dataset, for which the community composition and the read assignment is known. we then analyzed rna-seq datasets from two clinical samples that were generated for diagnostic purposes. we compare our results with the ones produced by megan version 5.3 andpathoscope 2.0. both methods are similarity based. this property and more specifically their flexibility to work with blastx output, makes them better candidates for viral discovery compared with composition-based methods. from the mixture model methods, we have chosen pathoscope. we were also interested in comparing our results to the ones by grammy, which was the first similaritybased method to use the idea of the mixture model. however, grammy is designed for nucleotide-nucleotide comparisons (blastn), which is suboptimal for viral discovery. grammy also only considers unassembled reads and requires that these are of the same fixed length. for these reasons, grammy was not included in the comparison. default parameters were used for all methods, unless stated otherwise. for the metamix output, we reported organisms with a posterior probability p 0.8 (default). the metamix read support parameter r, which essentially sets the sensitivity/specificity of the method, has an impact on the number of reported species. a large r value can result in the method merging together strains that are differentiated by fewer reads than r. on the other hand a low r can have the opposite effect, whereby the methods splits a strain into two or more strains, by moving a few reads from one strain to a very similar one with which they have equally good matches. the users choice for this key parameter r should be informed by the biological context. as an example, for the typical human clinical sample where the sample collection might have occurred some time after the infection has taken place, a low value in order to adopt a sensitive approach is reasonable. hence, for viral identification in human clinical samples, a low and sensitive value (r 10) is a reasonable choice. in a highly complex environmental metagenomic community where there is a plethora of species of similar abundances, the choice becomes less straightforward especially in the case of closely related strains. we set the default value for general community profiling in environmental samples at r 30. we also compare the output of metamix for different values of this parameter as well as for different posterior probability cutoffs. supplementary methods presents a discussion on the metamix settings as well as practical considerations.
