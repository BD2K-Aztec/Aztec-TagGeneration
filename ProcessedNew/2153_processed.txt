genome analysis hal: a hierarchical format for storing and analyzing multiple genome alignments motivation: large multiple genome alignments and inferred ancestral genomes are ideal resources for comparative studies of molecular evolution, and advances in sequencing and computing technology are making them increasingly obtainable. these structures can provide a rich understanding of the genetic relationships between all subsets of species they contain. current formats for storing genomic alignments, such as xmfa and maf, are all indexed or ordered using a single reference genome, however, which limits the information that can be queried with respect to other species and clades. this loss of information grows with the number of species under comparison , as well as their phylogenetic distance. results: we present hal, a compressed, graph-based hierarchical alignment format for storing multiple genome alignments and ancestral reconstructions. hal graphs are indexed on all genomes they contain. furthermore, they are organized phylogenetically, which allows for modular and parallel access to arbitrary subclades without fragmentation because of rearrangements that have occurred in other lin-eages. hal graphs can be created or read with a comprehensive c api. a set of tools is also provided to perform basic operations, such as importing and exporting data, identifying mutations and coordinate mapping (liftover). availability: all documentation and source code for the hal api and tools are freely available ata dna (or protein) sequence alignment groups together positions in the sequences they contain that are homologous (related by descent). positions within the same sequence can be homologous via duplication events. the multiple alignment problem is np-hard, but tools have been developed to produce large (tens of thousands of sequences) accurate alignments, provided the input sequences are relatively short and conserved, such as gene exons. whole-genome alignment is much more difficult not only because of the increased length of the input but also because of the presence of large spans of non-conserved sequence . changes because of large-scale rearrangement events, such as inversions, segmental duplications and transpositions, must also be taken into account in addition to point mutations and small insertions and deletions (indels). these challenges of creating whole-genome alignments carry over to their representation and analysis. gapped matrices that are traditionally used for gene alignments become fragmented into blocks by rearrangements or excessive divergence. these blocks are stored by current formats as ascii lines containing coordinates and dna strings for each sequence in the alignment. as blocks can only be ordered with respect to a single reference row, performing disk-based queries using non-reference coordinates is extremely inefficient because of fragmentation, even if external indexes were to be constructed for them. the hierarchical alignment (hal) graph structure and tool set described later in the text were designed to address this issue, while adding support for file compression.
