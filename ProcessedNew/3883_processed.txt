rapsearch2: a fast and memory-efficient protein similarity search tool for next-generation sequencing data with the wide application of next-generation sequencing (ngs) techniques, fast tools for protein similarity search that scale well to large query datasets and large databases are highly desirable. in a previous work, we developed rapsearch, an algorithm that achieved a 2090-fold speedup relative to blast while still achieving similar levels of sensitivity for short protein fragments derived from ngs data. rapsearch, however, requires a substantial memory footprint to identify alignment seeds, due to its use of a suffix array data structure. here we present rapsearch2, a new memory-efficient implementation of the rapsearch algorithm that uses a collision-free hash table to index a similarity search database. the utilization of an optimized data structure further speeds up the similarity searchanother 23 times. we also implemented multi-threading in rapsearch2, and the multi-thread modes achieve significant acceleration (e.g. 3.5x for 4-thread mode). rapsearch2 requires up to 2g memory when running in single thread mode, or up to 3.5g memory when running in 4-thread mode. availability and implementation: implemented in c++, the source code is freely available for download at the rapsearch2 website:the applications of next-generation sequencing (ngs) in transcriptome sequencing and metagenomics projects have resulted in enormous amounts of sequence. a key step to analyzing these sequences is to identify the protein-coding genes and their putative functions by similarity searches, which, for example, is useful for studying the functional content , or the taxonomic composition , of a microbial community. as a popular protein similarity search tool, blast , however, has become a bottleneck for the computational analysis of massive ngs datasets. on the other hand, fast algorithms such as blat can work up to 100 times faster than blast at identifying very similar protein sequences, but will still miss a substantial fraction ( 20) of weaker similarities . to whom correspondence should be addressed.to address this challenge, we developed a new protein database search tool rapsearch, which follows the seed-extension approach as used in blast, but is based on flexible-length seeds on a reduced amino acid alphabet of 10 symbols, each representing a group of amino acids . when tested on several ngs datasets, rapsearch achieved up to a 90x acceleration when compared with blast, while missing 5 of potential protein hits. however, because rapsearch uses a suffix array to index the database sequences for seed identification, it uses substantial memory for searches in large databases. here, we present rapsearch2, a new implementation of the rapsearch algorithm, which uses a collision-free hash table to index a protein database. rapsearch2 significantly reduces the memory requirement (e.g. from 8g to 2g when searching against the ncbi nr database) while further accelerating the similarity search process another 23 times. in rapsearch2, we also implemented a multi-threading technique that allows users to accelerate the similarity search even further on multi-core cpus.we used the same ngs datasets as used into test rapsearch2 (see the example datasets in the supplementary material). the integrated microbial genome (img) v3.0 and the ncbi nr (as of) (98 non-redundant set) databases were used as the search databases.compares the performance of rapsearch2 to rapsearch and blast on four query datasets on a computer with four xeon 2.93 ghz x5570 cpus with 48g ram [see more detailed comparison between rapsearch and blast in (. since rapsearch2 uses the same seed-extension algorithm as rapsearch, it gives identical results as rapsearch, except that it runs 23 times faster due to its optimized data structure. therefore, rapsearch2 retained the high sensitivity of rapsearch relative to blat [see the comparison between rapsearch and blat in and in. rapsearch2 also requires less memory than rapsearch. running in single thread mode requires up to 2g memory (one-fourth the 8g memory required by the original rapsearch), whereas running in 4-thread mode requires up to 3.5g memory, which is typically available on regular computer clusters. furthermore, the 4-thread mode achieved about a 3.5x acceleration compared with singlethread mode, while the 8-thread mode achieved an almost 6x acceleration, indicating that our multi-threading implementation is efficient. note that blat runs only slightly faster than rapsearch, but 23 times slower than rapsearch2. rapsearch2 uses the same probabilistic model to evaluate the significance of protein sequence alignments used in blast , and reports the e-values similarly. the output of rapsearch2 has the same format as blast, and can be directly adopted into any analytical pipeline to replace blast as the similarity search engine. therefore, rapsearch2 is readily used for routine protein similarity searches for ngs data.
