systems biology boolesim: an interactive boolean network simulator sinceintroduced boolean networks for biological simulations, they are extensively used to describe dynamic network behavior, especially when networks are big, experimental data scarce or only qualitatively available [i.e. cell cycle , signaling or stem cell differentiation (. boolean networks can be visualized as a graph consisting of a set of nodes representing the species of the network plus a set of edges representing the interactions between these species. in boolean networks, nodes can only take the discrete values 0 and 1. biological entities are thus exclusively viewed as active or inactive, phosphorylated or unphosphorylated, expressed or not expressed and nothing in between. this is a simplification of reality, as biochemical species can be present in a continuous range of concentrations. however, signals are often transmitted via threshold crossings. thus it is often appropriate to discriminate between two statesbelow and above the threshold which have different qualitative characteristics. transitions between these states are defined by boolean logical operations that can account for activation, inhibition and more complicated cooperative interactions. thus the use of boolean networks in mathematical modeling of biological processes is justifiable by its practicality . although software packages such as boolnet for r (mussel) or booleannet for python are available to simulate and analyze boolean networks, these packages require downloading, installation and a certain basic knowledge of programing. moreover, manipulating dynamic inactive node states. beneath its graphical representation of the time course, the time series heatmap functionality is also helpful e.g. to identify cyclic attractors. to enhance interoperability, boolesim supports exporting networks to python booleannet or r boolnet formats, export to and reimport from biographers internal exchange format jsbgn allowing storing the graph alongside its update rules together in one file. the network graph and time series can also be saved as svg vector image.to demonstrate our tool, we imported a submodel of a published probabilistic boolean network (pbn), describing epigenetic and transcriptional dynamics in somatic cell reprograming . to transform the pbn into a deterministic boolean network, we combined the update rules with the highest probability for every species. results are shown in. the time series represents a reprograming process, i.e. the transition from a differentiated cell lineage a to the pluripotent cell state and the minimal set of manipulations that were effected to enable this transition with the simplified synchronous boolean network (see).we presented a boolean modeling tool that is easy to use and provides users with a qualitative insight into dynamic behavior of biological networks. as the first tool for that purpose, it has inbrowser functionality and works cross-platform. it enables userswithout the need for downloading but simply by opening their browser (chromium recommended) and visiting the web site http://rumo.biologie.hu-berlin.de/boolesim/to load their network and perform simulations and manipulations through clicking on the colored nodes. boolesim is completely open source and licensed under the free software license gnu affero general public license (gpl) version 3. source code and off-line version are available on the github repository (https://github.com/matthiasbock/boolesim). in the future, boolesim could be extended to include stochasticity through asynchronous or pbns, to find attractors or to represent state spaces.
