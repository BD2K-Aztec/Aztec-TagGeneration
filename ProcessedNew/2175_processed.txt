gene expression heft: eqtl analysis of many thousands of expressed genes while simultaneously controlling for hidden factors motivation: identification of expression quantitative trait loci (eqtl), the genetic loci that contribute to heritable variation in gene expression , can be obstructed by factors that produce variation in expression profiles if these factors are unmeasured or hidden from direct analysis. methods: we have developed a method for hidden expression factor analysis (heft) that identifies individual and pleiotropic effects of eqtl in the presence of hidden factors. the heft model is a combined multivariate regression and factor analysis, where the complete likelihood of the model is used to derive a ridge estimator for simultaneous factor learning and detection of eqtl. heft requires no pre-estimation of hidden factor effects; it provides p-values and is extremely fast, requiring just a few hours to complete an eqtl analysis of thousands of expression variables when analyzing hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms on a standard 8 core 2.6 g desktop. results: by analyzing simulated data, we demonstrate that heft can correct for an unknown number of hidden factors and significantly outperforms all related hidden factor methods for eqtl analysis when there are eqtl with univariate and multivariate (pleiotropic) effects. to demonstrate a real-world application, we applied heft to identify eqtl affecting gene expression in the human lung for a study that included presumptive hidden factors. heft identified all of the cis-eqtl found by other hidden factor methods and 91 additional cis-eqtl. heft also identified a number of eqtls with direct relevance to lung disease that could not be found without a hidden factor analysis, including cis-eqtl for gtf2h1 and mtrr, genes that have been independently associated with lung cancer. availability: software is available atstudies that have identified expression quantitative trait loci (eqtl), the genetic loci that produce variation in cellular or tissue gene expression levels, have demonstrated that a considerable fraction of gene expression variation has a genetic basis . recently, more precise measurement of genome-wide gene expression levels using rna-seq technology , combined with greater marker coverage of genomes, has increased the resolution of eqtl analyses and has allowed more precise dissection of eqtl effects . a spectrum of new genome-wide assays making use of next-generation sequencing, such as methly-seq and dnase-seq , are providing quantitative data on other cellular profile variables that can be analyzed using an eqtl approach, opening the door for a broader x quantitative trait loci (xqtl) framework . this expanded capability and diversity of eqtl detection has also been accompanied by an appreciation that eqtl can provide useful insights into the genetic basis of disease . for example, eqtl identification is now routinely incorporated into the analysis of disease risk and other complex aspects of physiology . a consequence of these trends is a renewed interest in analysis methodologies used to identify eqtl from genome-wide data . for these new methods, there is a premium on the ability to identify as many eqtl as possible while simultaneously providing strict false-positive control. high performing, fast and reliable methods will also be particularly valuable for analyzing the highly multivariate mixed data-type xqtl studies that are on the near horizon. for a typical eqtl study that includes genome-wide data on both gene expression and genetic markers, identification of eqtl is generally accomplished using standard linear modeling approaches, where marker genotypes with a significant association with one or more expression variables are assumed to either indicate an eqtl or a marker that is in linkage disequilibrium (ld) with the eqtl polymorphism, i.e. the marker indicates the local genomic position of an eqtl . although such approaches are straightforward and successful, it is well appreciated that factors responsible for variation in gene expression, if unaccounted for in the statistical model, can dramatically affect both power and precision of genomewide eqtl detection . this is particularly true in uncontrolled study designs, as is often the case with human eqtl studies, where unmeasured environmental and other factors can influence gene expression profiles and confound eqtl analysis . more precisely, if to whom correspondence should be addressed the author 2013. published by oxford

factors contribute to the error term and this reduces the power to detect eqtl. if the effects of unaccounted for factors are non-orthogonal to the effects of eqtl, the result can be a false positive . that unaccounted for factors can be a problem for eqtl identification is not surprising given the many studies demonstrating that gene expression levels are highly variable and depend on a host of genetic and non-genetic factors . for statistical modeling purposes, we can categorize expression factors into three cases that require different analysis approaches: (i) a factor that is well represented by a variable that is directly measured in the study, (ii) a factor that can be inferred from the genotype data and (iii) a factor with effects that can be learned from gene expression data. the first includes cases where measured variables such as experimental batch, a disease state of an individual and so forth can be directly incorporated into the statistical model as a covariate. the second includes factors such as cryptic population structure or relatedness among individuals that can produce variation in measured gene expression levels. for many of these cases, appropriate variables can be inferred directly from the genome-wide genotype data, which can then be secondarily incorporated as fixed or random covariates to correct for factor effects . the third case includes expression factors that cannot be well modeled with covariates inferred from genotype data but have effects that can be learned from the covariance among expressed genes . for this case, the assumption is that the expression factor effects are large enough that the effects of the factors, although not the factors themselves, can be learned using a factor analysis or related approach . these learned factor effects can then be incorporated into the eqtl analysis as covariates and the eqtl analysis can be conducted on the residuals of the expression variables after subtracting the learned factors . the value of accounting for factors in an eqtl analysis that can be learned from expression covariance is just beginning to be appreciated and several recent methods have been proposed for this purpose . we note that these publications variously refer to these expression factors as hidden confounders , non-genetic factors , surrogate variables and so forth, but here we refer to them as hidden factors. in this article, we introduce a new method for eqtl analysis that accounts for the effects of hidden factors: hidden expression factor analysis (heft). the heft framework unifies a number of desirable goals when performing an eqtl analysis in the presence of hidden factors: p-value identification of eqtl with individual or multivariate (pleiotropic) effects on expressed genes, the ability to learn both orthogonal and nonorthogonal hidden factors that can inflate or deflate p-values without pre-learning these factors, and efficient scaling, such that an eqtl analysis of thousands of gene expression variables and hundreds of thousands of marker genotypes can be completed in a few hours on a standard desktop. critically, inference in heft is accomplished using the complete likelihood to derive a ridge estimator for combined factor learning and detection of eqtl, the value of which we illustrate by comparing the performance of heft with related hidden factor methods when analyzing simulated data . for a combination of null and hidden factor eqtl scenarios, we show that at worst heft has equal performance to these other methods and for the most realistic scenarios, where there are hidden factors and a combination of univariate and multivariate (pleiotropic) eqtl effects, heft correctly identifies more eqtl than these other methods without an increase in false positives. we also demonstrate the real-world discovery value of a hidden factor analysis by using heft to identify eqtl that affect gene expression in the human lung from a sample of smokers and non-smokers by assessing possible associations of 7575 expression variables with 191 959 genotypes. in this analysis, heft identified all of the cis-eqtl found by other hidden factor methods and 91 additional cis-eqtl. heft also identified a number of eqtls with direct relevance to lung disease that could not be found without a hidden factor analysis. many of these newly discovered eqtl have clear connections to lung physiology and disease, including cis-eqtl for general transcription factor iih, polypeptide 1 (gtf2h1) and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase reductase (mtrr), two genes that have been independently associated with lung cancer .
