pseudotime estimation: deconfounding single cell time series motivation: repeated cross-sectional time series single cell data confound several sources of variation , with contributions from measurement noise, stochastic cell-to-cell variation and cell progression at different rates. time series from single cell assays are particularly susceptible to confounding as the measurements are not averaged over populations of cells. when several genes are assayed in parallel these effects can be estimated and corrected for under certain smoothness assumptions on cell progression. results: we present a principled probabilistic model with a bayesian inference scheme to analyse such data. we demonstrate our methods utility on public microarray, ncounter and rna-seq data-sets from three organisms. our method almost perfectly recovers withheld capture times in an arabidopsis dataset, it accurately estimates cell cycle peak times in a human prostate cancer cell line and it correctly identifies two precocious cells in a study of paracrine signalling in mouse den-dritic cells. furthermore, our method compares favourably with monocle, a state-of-the-art technique. we also show using held-out data that uncertainty in the temporal dimension is a common confounder and should be accounted for in analyses of repeated cross-sectional time series. availability and implementation: our method is available on cran in the delorean package.many biological systems involve transitions between cellular states characterized by gene expression signatures. these systems are typically studied by assaying gene expression over a time course to investigate which genes regulate the transitions. an ideal study of such a system would track individual cells through the transitions between states. studies of this form are termed longitudinal. however, current medium and high-throughput assays used to measure gene expression destroy cells as part of the protocol. this results in repeated cross-sectional data wherein each sample is taken from a different cell. this study analyses the problem of variation in the temporal dimension: cells do not necessarily transition at a common rate between states. even if several cells about to undergo a transition are synchronized by an external signal, when samples are taken at a later time point each cell may have reached a different point in the transition. this suggests a notion of pseudotime to model these systems. pseudotime is a latent (unobserved) dimension which measures the cells progress through the transition. pseudotime is related to but not necessarily the same as laboratory capture time. variation in the temporal dimension is a particular problem in repeated cross-sectional studies as each sample must be assigned a pseudotime individually. in longitudinal studies, information can be shared across measurements from the same cell at different times. inconsistency in the experimental protocol is another source of variation in the temporal dimension. it may not be physically possible to assay several cells at precisely the same time point. this leads naturally to the idea that the cells should be ordered by the pseudotime they were assayed. the exploration of cell-to-cell heterogeneity of expression levels has recently been made possible by single cell assays. many authors have investigated various biological systems using mediumthroughput technologies such as qpcr and ncounter or highthroughput technologies such as rna-seq . these studies have shown that cellular heterogeneity is prevalent in many organisms and regulatory systems. the variation in gene expression underlying this cellular heterogeneity has been attributed to several causes both technical and biological . while accounting for variation in expression levels, none of these studies investigated how much is attributable to uncertainty in the temporal dimension. conversely, methods such as monocle and wanderlust (described below) have attempted to place cells in a pseudotemporal ordering but do not explicitly model variation in the data. analyses of medium and high-throughput expression assays often use dimension reduction techniques. anywhere between 40 and several tens of thousands of gene expression levels may have been measured in each sample. this high-dimensional data can often be better analysed after projection into a low (two or three) dimensional latent space. often this projection results in a natural clustering of cells from different time points or of different cell types which can then be related to the biology of the system. such clusterings may suggest hypotheses about likely transitions between clusters and their relationship in time. dimension reduction has a large literature and there are many available methods. here, we give a few examples of some that have been used in single cell expression analyses. principal components analysis (pca) is prevalent in analyses of expression data . pca finds linear transformations of the data that preserve as much of the variance as possible. in one example typical of single cell transcriptomics,studied the development of the mouse blastocyst from the one-cell stage to the 64-cell stage. they projected their 48-dimensional qpcr data into two dimensions using pca. projection into these two dimensions clearly separated the three cell types present in the 64-cell stage. multi-dimensional scaling (mds) is another popular dimension reduction technique. mds aims to place each sample in a lower dimensional space such that distances between samples are conserved as much as possible.used mds to study the differentiation of thp-1 human myeloid monocytic leukemia cells into macrophages after stimulation with pma. their primary mds axis explained the temporal progression through the differentiation, their secondary mds axis explained the early-response of the cells to the stimulation they had undergone. independent components analysis (ica) projects high dimensional data into a latent space that maximizes the statistical independence of the projected axes.used ica to investigate the differentiation of primary human myoblasts. the latent space serves as a first stage in their pseudotime estimation algorithm monocle (see below). gaussian process (gp) latent variable models (gplvms) are a dimension reduction technique related to pca. they can be seen as a non-linear extension to a probabilistic interpretation of pca .and buettner and theis (2012) used gplvms to study the differentiation of cells in the mouse blastocyst. they used qpcr data fromwho had analysed the expression of 48 genes in cells spanning the 1-to 64-cell stages of blastocyst development. buettner et al. were able to uncover subpopulations of cells at the 16-cell stage, one stage earlier than guo et al. had identified using pca. the latent space in all of the methods above is unstructured: there is no direct physical or biological interpretation of the space and the methods do not directly relate experimental covariates such as cell type or capture time to the space. the samples are placed in the space only to maximize some relevant statistic, although the analysis often reveals some additional structure. for example, one axis may coincide with the temporal dimension of the data, or cell types may be clearly separated. in these cases, the structure has been inferred in an unsupervised manner. however, there is no guarantee that the methods above will uncover any specific structure of interest, for example, a pseudotime ordering. here, we propose to impose an a priori structure on the latent space. in the model presented in this article, the latent space is onedimensional and the structure we impose on the space relates it to the temporal information of the cell capture times. that is the latent space represents the pseudotime. a number of methods have been proposed to estimate pseudotimes in gene expression time series. proposed a temporal scaling method dynb to estimate pseudotimes. dynb shifts the observed time by a multiplicative factor representing speed of transition through the process. it is applicable to longitudinal rather than repeated cross-sectional time series. aij et al. modelled rna-seq count data from human th17 cell differentiation using a negative binomial distribution with a time-varying mean. for each of three biological replicates, they analysed subpopulations of cells at given time points resulting in three time series of longitudinal data. the time-varying mean was fit using a gp over the scaled pseudotime space. they compared this pseudotime based model favourably with a similar model that only used the capture time points.have developed the monocle pseudotime estimation algorithm. monocle is a two-stage procedure: first, it uses the ica dimension reduction algorithm to map gene expression data into a low-dimensional space; second, it finds the minimal spanning tree (mst) over the samples locations in this space. this spanning tree is used to assign a pseudotime to each cell. trapnell et al. show how monocle can be used to identify pseudotemporal ordering, switch-like changes in expression, novel regulatory factors and sequential waves of gene regulation.have developed the waterfall pseudotime estimation algorithm that is closely related to monocle. waterfall reduces the dimension of the data to 2 using pca, uses k-means clustering in this space to group the data and calculates a mst over the cluster centroids to induce a pseudotime trajectory. after estimating the pseudotime, waterfall uses a hidden markov model (hmm) to infer when genes switch on and off. campbell et al. have a body of work investigating pseudotime estimation. they developed the embeddr r package that uses a similar approach to monocle but with some significant differences. they use laplacian eigenmaps for dimensionality reduction instead of ica and fit pseudotime trajectories using principal curves rather than msts. dissatisfied with the point estimates of pseudotimes such an approach generates they subsequently developed a fully bayesian probabilistic model using gps . wanderlust is a graph-based pseudotime estimation algorithm developed by. wanderlust arranges the highdimensional input data into a nearest neighbour graph wherein cells that have similar expression profiles are connected. wanderlust then applies a repetitive randomized shortest path algorithm to assign an average pseudotime to each cell. bendall et al. used wanderlust to analyse human b cell lymphopoiesis. the monocle, waterfall, embeddr and wanderlust algorithms do not make a connection between the cell capture times and the estimated pseudotime explicitly. this has two effects: first, in the inference of the pseudotime, nonsensical results are possible such as pseudotimes whose order is far from the capture times; second, the estimated pseudotimes are not on the same scale as the capture times, they are quantified in arbitrary temporal units. oscope is a method for detecting groups of oscillatory genes. when a group is detected oscope uses an extended nearest insertion algorithm to place the cells in pseudotime order.we have presented a principled probabilistic model that accounts for uncertainty in the capture times of repeated cross-sectional time series. we have fit our model to three separate datasets each using a different biological assay (microarrays, single cell ncounter and single cell rna-seq) in three organisms (human, mouse and arabidopsis). our model provided plausible estimates of pseudotimes on all the datasets. we validated these estimates technically by evaluating the smoothness of the expression profiles of held-out genes in two of the datasets. these profiles are significantly smoother than expected under the null model. in addition, we validated the estimates biologically using obfuscated capture times (inangles. these two cells have been placed at a later pseudotime than the other cells captured at 1 h. a loess curve has also been plotted through the data the arabidopsis dataset), data from separate experiments (cell cycle peak times) and independent analyses (identification of precocious cells). overall these results demonstrate that uncertainty in the temporal dimension should not be ignored in repeated cross-sectional time series of single cell data and that our method captures and corrects for these effects. our method has a number of attractive attributes. it explicitly estimates pseudotimes in contrast to methods such as monocle and wanderlust which estimate orderings of cells. the pseudotimes are on the same scale as the experimental capture times. the orderings estimated by monocle and wanderlust have no scale. in our model, consecutive cells that have diverse expression profiles are placed further apart in pseudotime than similar cells. thus, our pseudotime estimates quantify the rate of change of the system. for example, in the arabidopsis example, we analysed the cells are spread out in pseudotime around the 20-h mark suggesting changes in expression levels in response to the infection are greatest at this time point. our method uses gps which are a natural framework to model noisy expression profiles. gps are well established probabilistic models for time series. they provide more than just point estimates of the profiles, they also provide a measure of posterior uncertainty. this is useful in downstream analyses such as regulatory network inference. a gp model is characterized by its covariance function and associated parameters and the covariance functions in our model have interpretable parameters: gene-specific temporal variation and noise. we have also demonstrated how a gp framework is suitable for modelling periodic expression profiles such as cell cycle expression profiles. the primary limitation of gps for our model is that inference complexity scales cubically in the number of samples. for this reason, our method is not applicable to data from many hundreds or thousands of cells like monocle and wanderlust. inference in our model is performed using markov chain monte carlo. this technique provides a full posterior distribution over the model parameters. however, mixing over the pseudotime parameters in our model can be difficult and we found that our model did not mix well when fit to the cell cycle dataset. in this case, we analysed expression profiles from the sample with highest log probability and found they estimated cell cycle peak times well. single cell assays give us an exciting opportunity to explore heterogeneity in populations of cells. as the technology develops and the cost of undertaking such assays drops, they are destined to become commonplace. in addition, high-throughput longitudinal studies remain impractical and for the foreseeable future the majority of such time series will be repeated cross-sectional in nature. until this changes, there will be challenges associated with estimating uncertainty in the capture times and variation in the rate of progress of individual cells through a system. our method explicitly models these effects and is a practical tool for analysis of such repeated crosssectional time series. furthermore, in contrast to wanderlust, our method only depends on open-source software and is available under a liberal open-source license.
