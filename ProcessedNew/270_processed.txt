an algorithm for computing the gene tree probability under the multispecies coalescent and its application in the inference of population tree motivation: gene tree represents the evolutionary history of gene lineages that originate from multiple related populations. under the multispecies coalescent model, lineages may coalesce outside the species (population) boundary. given a species tree (with branch lengths), the gene tree probability is the probability of observing a specific gene tree topology under the multispecies coales-cent model. there are two existing algorithms for computing the exact gene tree probability. the first algorithm is due to degnan and salter, where they enumerate all the so-called coalescent histories for the given species tree and the gene tree topology. their algorithm runs in exponential time in the number of gene lineages in general. the second algorithm is the stells algorithm (2012), which is usually faster but also runs in exponential time in almost all the cases. results: in this article, we present a new algorithm, called compactch, for computing the exact gene tree probability. this new algorithm is based on the notion of compact coalescent histories: multiple coalescent histories are represented by a single compact coalescent history. the key advantage of our new algorithm is that it runs in polynomial time in the number of gene lineages if the number of populations is fixed to be a constant. the new algorithm is more efficient than the stells algorithm both in theory and in practice when the number of populations is small and there are multiple gene lineages from each population. as an application, we show that compactch can be applied in the inference of population tree (i.e. the population divergence history) from population haplotypes. simulation results show that the compactch algorithm enables efficient and accurate inference of population trees with much more haplotypes than a previous approach. availability: the compactch algorithm is implemented in the stells software package, which is available for download atconsider n gene lineages sampled from one population. when we trace these lineages backward in time, sooner or later two of these lineages will find a common ancestor. when this occurs, we say these two lineages coalesce or the coalescent of these two lineages occurs. gene lineages coalesce in a stochastic way, which is influenced by multiple population genetic parameters, such as population sizes. therefore, coalescents may potentially reveal important aspects of population evolution.introduced the coalescent theory, which provides the analytical foundation for the study of coalescents. since then, coalescent theory has quickly become a very active research subject in population genetics. there are numerous theoretical results in coalescent theory, along with many coalescent-based software tools. see wakeley (2008) andfor an overview of the growing field of coalescent theory. while mathematically appealing, coalescent is known to be challenging computationally. one of the most important problems on coalescents is computing the coalescent likelihood. that is, we want to compute the probability of observing some population variation v c the author 2016. published by oxford university press.we have implemented our new compactch algorithm as part of the stells program (http://www.engr.uconn.edu/ywu/stells. html). we compare with the stells algorithm, which is currently the best algorithm for computing the gene tree probability. we first show that compactch outperforms the original stells when the number of species is small and there are multiple gene lineages per species. then, as an application, we show that compactch allows fast and accurate inference of population trees from haplotypes when there are multiple haplotypes from each population.
