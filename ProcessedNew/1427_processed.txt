genome analysis displayhts: a r package for displaying data and results from high-throughput screening experiments high-throughput screening (hts) technologies play a critical role in modern biological research and drug discovery . one of the major advantages of hts technologies is their ability to simultaneously interrogate thousands of genes/ compounds per experiment. to glean biological information from large volumes of hts data, the first step in data analysis is to use specific graphics to visualize and display important features of data. data display allows the identification of potential problems such as systematic spatial effects, pin issues, assay quality issues and so forth, as they occur . the methods and figures of displaying data in hts experiments have been described to disclose various patterns of spatial effects and assay quality issues in the literature . specific figures such as dual-flashlight plot have also been explored previously . however, there is a lack of an analytic tool to implement all those methods and figures. to serve this need, here we develop an r package displayhts to display data and results from hts experiments. the r package can generate not only plate-based images but also differential abundance/enrichment plots. specifically, it can generate useful distinctive graphics such as (i) the plate-well series plot that can display data well by well and plate by plate in an experiment , (ii) the plate image that incorporates box-plot statistics and reveals positions and patterns of selected hits and (iii) the dual-flashlight plot that shows both average fold change and effect size reflected by strictly standardized mean difference (ssmd) . displayhts can also generate other plots such as the volcano plot and plate correlation plot.
