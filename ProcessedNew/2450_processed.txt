inferring duplications, losses, transfers and incomplete lineage sorting with nonbinary species trees motivation: gene duplication (d), transfer (t), loss (l) and incomplete lineage sorting (i) are crucial to the evolution of gene families and the emergence of novel functions.the history of these events can be inferred via comparison of gene and species trees, a process called reconciliation, yet current reconciliation algorithms model only a subset of these evolutionary processes. results: we present an algorithm to reconcile a binary gene tree with a nonbinary species tree under a dtli parsimony criterion. this is the first reconciliation algorithm to capture all four evolutionary processes driving tree incongruence and the first to reconcile non-binary species trees with a transfer model. our algorithm infers all optimal solutions and reports complete, temporally feasible event histories, giving the gene and species lineages in which each event occurred. it is fixed-parameter tractable, with polytime complexity when the maximum species outdegree is fixed. application of our algorithms to prokaryotic and eukaryotic data show that use of an incomplete event model has substantial impact on the events inferred and resulting biological conclusions.the phylogeny of a gene family evolving by vertical descent will agree with the associated species tree. gene duplication, gene loss, horizontal gene transfer (hgt) or incomplete lineage sorting (ils) can result in a gene tree that differs from the species tree . the history of such events can be inferred through topological comparison of gene and species trees, a process called reconciliation. reconciliation encompasses two related problems: event inference and tree inference. given rooted gene and species trees, a mapping from extant genes to extant species, and an event model, the goal of event inference is to infer the association between ancestral genes and species and the optimal event history with respect to a combinatorial or probabilistic optimization criterion. a complete solution must include the specific events and the gene and species lineages in which those events occurred. given a set of gene trees, tree inference seeks the species tree that optimizes the combined events resulting from reconciliation with each gene tree in the input set. here, we address the event inference problem for a model that captures all four evolutionary processes contributing to gene tree incongruence. whole genome sequencing data are revealing to whom correspondence should be addressed. an ever growing number of cases where all four processes are active (e.g.,), leading to calls for algorithms that model multiple evolutionary processes . algorithms lacking a model of incongruence due to ils will overestimate the number of duplications and/or transfers. for example, a recent analysis, based on a model that did not consider ils, reported an inexplicable but dramatic increase in duplications in recently sequenced mammalian genomes . for large-scale analysis of multigenome phylogenetic datasets, reconciliation algorithms that allow ils to be distinguished from other sources of incongruence are essential.this work presents the first reconciliation algorithm for the event inference problem under a model that captures the four major evolutionary processes driving tree incongruence: duplication, loss, transfer and ils. our algorithm reconciles a binary gene tree with a non-binary species tree and is, to our knowledge, the first algorithm to allow non-binary species trees with a transfer model. our algorithm outputs detailed event histories, describing the specific events inferred and the lineages in which they occurred. when restricted to binary species trees, our algorithm reduces to an event inference algorithm for the dtl model that can infer all i414
