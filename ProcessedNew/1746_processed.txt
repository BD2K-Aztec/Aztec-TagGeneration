fast alignment of fragmentation trees motivation: mass spectrometry allows sensitive, automated and high-throughput analysis of small molecules such as metabolites. one major bottleneck in metabolomics is the identification of unknown small molecules not in any database. recently, fragmentation tree alignments have been introduced for the automated comparison of the fragmentation patterns of small molecules. fragmentation pattern similarities are strongly correlated with the chemical similarity of the molecules, and allow us to cluster compounds based solely on their fragmentation patterns. results: aligning fragmentation trees is computationally hard. nevertheless, we present three exact algorithms for the problem: a dynamic programming (dp) algorithm, a sparse variant of the dp, and an integer linear program (ilp). evaluation of our methods on three different datasets showed that thousands of alignments can be computed in a matter of minutes using dp, even for challenging instances. running times of the sparse dp were an order of magnitude better than for the classical dp. the ilp was clearly outperformed by both dp approaches. we also found that for both dp algorithms, computing the 1 slowest alignments required as much time as computing the 99 fastest.metabolomics deals with the identification and quantification of small compounds below 1000 da, and has received increasing interest during the last years . all organisms, especially plants, fungi and bacteria, synthesize many different metabolites and a large portion of them is still unknown . the genome sequence usually does not reveal information about metabolite structure, as it does for protein structure. newly identified metabolites often serve as leads in drug design , in particular for antibiotics. for a high-throughput analysis of metabolites and other small molecules, mass spectrometry (ms) is the predominant technology . nuclear magnetic resonance reveals more information about the analyte, but is inapplicable for high-throughput analysis due to its low sensitivity. ms can be coupled with a separation method (gas chromatography, liquid chromatography or capillary electrophoresis) to analyze complex mixtures like cell extracts . to obtain information beyond the compound mass, the analyte is usually fragmented, and fragment masses are recorded. typically, collision-induced dissociation is combined with liquid chromatographyms, whereas gas chromatographyms uses electron impact fragmentation. the first attempt to develop computational methods for analyzing fragmentation spectra of to whom correspondence should be addressed. metabolites has been the dendral project in 1965 . but the project was stopped after it became clear that automated structure elucidation using ms data could not be achieved at that time. today, data analysis is still the major bottleneck in metabolomics . manual data analysis requires time and deep knowledge of the underlying chemistry . due to the limited reproducibility of the data, even library searches are difficult . additionally, spectral libraries are vastly incomplete. methods for de novo sequencing of non-ribosomal peptides have recently been developed. but these methods rely on the fact that the analytes are structurally restricted polymers with predictable fragmentation. when manually analyzing tandem ms spectra, chemists try to annotate fragmentation peaks and identify relations between fragments, resulting in fragmentation pathways. this approach has been automated by. they calculate hypothetical fragmentation trees solely based on the ms data. fragmentation tree nodes are annotated with the molecular formula of the fragments, whereas edges represent losses. to find a fragmentation tree that shows maximum agreement with the measured data, we search for a tree of maximum edge weight, comparable to prize-collecting steiner trees . only lists of common and implausible losses are required as expert knowledge about fragmentation mechanisms. in, experts evaluated the calculated fragmentation trees and confirmed their excellent quality. recently, methods to calculate fragmentation trees from multiple ms and gas chromatography ms data have been developed . ms analysis of similar compounds results in similar fragmentation trees.proposed local tree alignments for the automated comparison of fragmentation trees and showed that this method is superior to spectral comparison. fragmentation tree alignments even allow for inter-dataset comparisons for datasets measured on different instruments . a tree alignment may contain matches, mismatches, insertions and deletions, but respects the structure of the two trees. fragmentation tree similarity is defined via edges (representing losses) and nodes (representing fragments). a local tree alignment contains those parts of the two trees where similar fragmentation cascades occurred. tree alignments were introduced byand can be applied for rna secondary structure comparison . rna structure trees are ordered, that is, the children of any node have a fixed order. in contrast, fragmentation trees are unordered, as there cannot exist any sensible ordering for the sub fragments of some fragment. in this respect, fragmentation trees are more similar to phylogenetic trees than to rna structure trees. whereas efficient, polynomial-time algorithms exist for the alignment of ordered trees, the alignment of unordered trees is computationally hard, namely max snp-hard . this implies that there exists no). in case both trees have fixed maximum out degree, an optimum alignment can be computed via dynamic programming (dp) in polynomial time . in comparison, computing the edit distance between two unordered trees remains max snp hard even for bounded degrees . an informal algorithm for aligning fragmentation trees was presented by, and join nodes were introduced to account for missing nodes in one of the trees compared. missing nodes result from missing peaks in one of the spectra.do not give a correctness proof or running time analysis for the algorithm. as related work, we mention the treeconstrained bipartite matching problem where either a node or any of its descendants may be part of the matching; this problem is also apx-hard . our contribution: we modify the tree alignment algorithm fromfor edge similarities and local alignments, and analyze its running time. we then show how to integrate join nodes without increasing the worst-case running time. next, we modify the algorithm to allow for sparse dp, a technique common in rna folding . this does not only decrease the practical memory requirements of the method but, more importantly, also severely decreases running times in practice. furthermore, we present an integer linear program (ilp) for the fragmentation tree alignment problem, as ilps often solve np-hard problems swiftly in practice. we then evaluate all methods on real-world data, and find that the sparse dp approach dominates the classical dp, resulting in an 11-fold speed-up for one dataset. somewhat unexpectedly, the ilp is clearly outperformed by both dp approaches.
