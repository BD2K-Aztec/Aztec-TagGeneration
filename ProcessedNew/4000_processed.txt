gene expression rfmapp: ribosome flow model application the rfmapp is a graphical user interface application based on the rfm (ribosome flow model), enabling the estimation of the translation elongation rates of messenger ribonucleic acids (mrnas) and the profile of ribosomal densities along the mrnas, in a computationally efficient way. the rfmapp is based on the approach previously described by reuveni et al., and unlike other traditional approaches in the field, which are mainly related to the genes mean codon translation efficiency, the rfm additionally considers the codon order, the ribosomes size and their order. thus, it has been shown that rfm outperforms traditional predictors when analyzing both heterologous and endogenous genes. availability and implementation: distributable cross-platform application and guideline are available for download at:gene translation is a complex process through which a messenger ribonucleic acid (mrna) sequence is decoded by the ribosome to produce a specific protein. the elongation step of this process is an iterative procedure in which each codon in the mrna sequence is recognized by a specific transfer rna (trna), which adds one additional amino acid to the growing peptide. as gene translation is a central process in all living organisms, its understanding has important ramifications to every biomedical field, namely human health , biotechnology and evolution . in recent years, there has been a sharp increase in emerging technologies for measuring different features related to the process of gene translation . however, this process is still enigmatic and contradicting conclusions regarding the essential parameters that determine translation rates appear in different studies ; suggesting that the rate-limiting parameters vary across organisms, under diverse conditions and in different genes. ribosome flow model (rfm) is a new approach for modeling the process of translation elongation, affording the first large-scale analysis of gene translation elongation, while taking into account the stochastic nature of the translation process. rfm is aimed at
