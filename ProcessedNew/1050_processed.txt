genetics and population analysis comment on 'bayesian parentage analysis with systematic accountability of genotyping error, missing data and false matching' we show the software solomon is improved by using the likelihood ratio instead of an ad hoc statistic.in a recent bioinformatics article, christie, tennessen and blouin (hereafter ctb) present the software solomon for parentage inference from genotype data . they propose a method of estimating the number of true parent-offspring pairs amongst all the candidate pairs in a dataset and show it provides better results than the program cervus when the fraction of sampled candidates (an input to cervus) is misspecified. here we show that the performance of solomon can be improved by making full use of the genotype data, replacing ctbs statistic with the likelihood ratio as prescribed by a well-established literature . this is particularly beneficial when using single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) chosen to have minor allele frequency near 0.5, as desired for snp-based pedigree reconstruction .
