data and text mining mouse model phenotypes provide information about human drug targets motivation: methods for computational drug target identification use information from diverse information sources to predict or prioritize drug targets for known drugs. one set of resources that has been relatively neglected for drug repurposing is animal model phenotype. results: we investigate the use of mouse model phenotypes for drug target identification. to achieve this goal, we first integrate mouse model phenotypes and drug effects, and then systematically compare the phenotypic similarity between mouse models and drug effect profiles. we find a high similarity between phenotypes resulting from loss-of-function mutations and drug effects resulting from the inhibition of a protein through a drug action, and demonstrate how this approach can be used to suggest candidate drug targets. availability and implementation: analysis code and supplementary data files are available on the project web site at https://drugeffects.a major challenge currently faced by pharmacological research is the high rate of attrition in the development of new compounds, the increased cost of drug development and increased regulatory concern about drug safety and efficacy . as a result, pharmacological research is beginning to focus on repurposing existing drugs for new indications, and several large national and international research initiatives have begun to systematically address drug repurposing on a broad scale . strategies for drug repurposing can be divided into two main types: identification of new targets for known drugs and identification of new indications for a known mechanism of action . approaches to drug repurposing include database-driven bioinformatics approaches, in vivo and ex vivo studies and high-throughput screening methods . examples of computational approaches to drug repurposing include side effect-based approaches, in which similarity between drug effects is used to suggest drug targets and drug indications , data mining of clinical records and approaches based on analysis of gwas data . computational approaches to drug repurposing have the highest chance of succeeding if multiple independent data sources and analysis approaches are combined so that data from several independent domains and studies can be used to identify strong evidence for novel drug indications. based on integrating multiple complementary datasets, integrative computational approaches can use multiple measures to prioritize candidate targets and drugs . one set of resources that has been relatively neglected for drug repurposing is animal model phenotype . the use of non-human species to investigate physiology and pathobiology, and the creation of animal models of human diseases amenable to experimental investigation, has become a successful paradigm in the biomedical sciences . the development of highthroughput phenotyping has further increased the available amount of phenotype data resulting from targeted mutations in animal models, and pan-genomic projects such as the international mouse phenotyping consortium (impc) aim to delete every protein-coding gene in an organism and to identify the phenotypes resulting from these mutations. it has now become a challenge to systematically analyze the resulting data and use them to provide insights into human health and novel intervention strategies. in the past, several studies have used animal model data to suggest candidate genes for genetically based diseases , and one study also suggests that mouse model phenotypes can be used to provide insights into drug actions and drug effects in humans despite experimental differences between the two species . here, we use a phenome-wide approach to systematically compare drug effects with mutant mouse phenotypes . we provide strong supporting evidence for the hypothesis that the similarity between drug effects and mouse phenotypes that result from loss of protein function indicates a similarity in the to whom correspondence should be addressed the author 2013. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. mechanism of action, i.e. an inhibition of the protein through the drug. we evaluate our results with experimentally validated lists of known drug targets and demonstrate on a genomic scale that a similarity between drug effects and mutant mouse phenotypes can reveal drug targets. our approach opens the possibility for a systematic analysis of animal model phenotypes for candidate drug targets, and has a significant impact for integrative computational approaches to drug repurposing.
