characterizing rate limiting steps in transcription from rna production times in live cells motivation: single-molecule measurements of live escherichia coli transcription dynamics suggest that this process ranges from sub-to super-poissonian, depending on the conditions and on the promoter. for its accurate quantification, we propose a model that accommodates all these settings, and statistical methods to estimate the model parameters and to select the relevant components. results: the new methodology has improved accuracy and avoids overestimating the transcription rate due to finite measurement time, by exploiting unobserved data and by accounting for the effects of discrete sampling. first, we use monte carlo simulations of models based on measurements to show that the methods are reliable and offer substantial improvements over previous methods. next, we apply the methods on measurements of transcription intervals of different promoters in live e. coli, and show that they produce significantly different results, both in low-and high-noise settings, and that, in the latter case, they even lead to qualitatively different results. finally, we demonstrate that the methods can be generalized for other similar purposes, such as for estimating gene activation kinetics. in this case, the new methods allow quantifying the inducer uptake dynamics as opposed to just comparing them between cases, which was not previously possible. we expect this new methodology to be a valuable tool for functional analysis of cellular processes using single-molecule or single-event microscopy measurements in live cells. availability and implementation: source code is available under mozilla public license atin bacteria, transcription is the main regulatory mechanism of rna numbers in the cell. this conclusion is supported by the lack of correlation between rna numbers and their degradation rates and by the fact that most regulatory molecules modulate the transcription initiation process . relevantly, the regulatory mechanisms of transcription allow wide adaptability, as the kinetics of this process varies widely between promoters, and for the same promoter under different conditions. live cell measurements in escherichia coli suggest that depending on the promoter and the conditions, such as the presence/ absence of repressor/activator molecules, rna production can range from sub-poissonian, that is, less uncertain than a poisson process , through poissonian , to super-poissonian . such wide dynamic range is not likely achievable by a single mechanism and, in agreement, evidence suggests that this is a multi-step process .currently, the subprocesses that constitute transcription cannot be directly measured in live cells. however, it is possible to observe rna production of individual promoters with single molecule resolution over time . this information can be used to estimate the dynamical parameters of the subprocesses by the means of a stochastic model . the success of this strategy requires accurate and unbiased statistical methods of data analysis as well as a model that can account for all possible dynamical regimes. previously, we made use of distributions of intervals between transcription events in various conditions in order to estimate in maximum likelihood (ml) sense, for each condition, the number and duration of the rate limiting steps in transcription . relevantly, unlike rna numbers, these intervals are not affected by rna degradation, or dilution due to cell division, and consequently allow more accurate quantification of the transcription process. however, the previous model of transcription does not cover all potential cases (e.g. super-poissonian rna production). here, we first propose a model that, by combining previous models responsible for different dynamical behaviors , is capable of exhibiting behaviors ranging from sub-to super-poissonian. next, we present methods to estimate its parameters in ml sense. an advantage over previous methods is that the new methods also use information of the unobserved transcription events. such additional information results in improved accuracy and can be used to correct the biases resulting from the limited the measurement time. the methods can also account for the discrete sampling, which is typical for a fluorescence microscopy measurement. the increased accuracy allows studying subprocesses with smaller time scales, while the lack of bias is essential in order to correctly estimate the parameters of the more noisy models and to compare them in an unbiased manner. the methods can also be used to provide features such as confidence in the estimated parameters, and we use statistical methods to select components of the model in/out, which can be used to determine if certain components are responsible for the observed dynamical behavior.we have proposed a model that combines a promoter onoff mechanism with a sequential process of transcription initiation , which allows explaining recent measurements of transcription dynamics under a wide range of conditions , and established methods to estimate its parameters in maximum likelihood sense using transcription interval data. the methods enable more accurate quantification of the transcriptional dynamics both in theory and in practice, as demonstrated by the monte carlo simulations, as well as testing if particular components of the model are responsible for the observed dynamics. in addition, we compared the methods with previous methodsthe table shows the number of samples, the selected model (sel model), the estimated parameters and estimates of their standard deviation and the mean (est mean), standard deviation (est sd)

significantly different results and can provide new biological insight (e.g. on the underlying sources of noise in transcription). finally, we demonstrated that the methods have a wider applicability on problems of similar nature, such as estimating the kinetics of external activation of a promoter. in its present form, the proposed model should already be detailed enough to allow a genome-wide analysis of transcription and transcription activation of individual genes under a wide range of conditions in prokaryotes, which is necessary to understand how inducers and repressors regulate the dynamics of gene expression. further, we believe that our methods can be extended to enable future studies of eukaryotic transcription dynamics and of translational dynamics at the single protein level.
