genetics and population analysis cosi2: an efficient simulator of exact and approximate coalescent with selection motivation: efficient simulation of population genetic samples under a given demographic model is a prerequisite for many analyses. coalescent theory provides an efficient framework for such simulations , but simulating longer regions and higher recombination rates remains challenging. simulators based on a markovian approximation to the coalescent scale well, but do not support simulation of selection. gene conversion is not supported by any published coalescent simulators that support selection. results: we describe cosi2, an efficient simulator that supports both exact and approximate coalescent simulation with positive selection. cosi2 improves on the speed of existing exact simulators, and permits further speedup in approximate mode while retaining support for selection. cosi2 supports a wide range of demographic scenarios, including recombination hot spots, gene conversion, population size changes, population structure and migration. cosi2 implements coalescent machinery efficiently by tracking only a small subset of the ancestral recombination graph, sampling only relevant recombination events, and using augmented skip lists to represent tracked genetic segments. to preserve support for selection in approximate mode, the markov approximation is implemented not by moving along the chromosome but by performing a standard backwards in time coalescent simulation while restricting coalescence to node pairs with overlapping or near-overlapping genetic material. we describe the algorithms used by cosi2 and present comparisons with existing selection simulators. availability and implementation: a free c+ + implementation of cosi2 is available ata wide variety of population genetic analyses depend on efficient simulation of samples under a demographic model. the most efficient simulation method works backwards in time from the sample, first simulating the samples genealogy according to coalescent theory and then placing mutations on that genealogy. because of crossing over and gene conversion, the overall genealogy for a simulated region is not a tree but a directed acyclic graph whose size grows quickly with region length and with recombination rate. to address this simulation bottleneck, a markovian approximation was proposed and implemented . however, the markovian approximation does not readily allow for the modeling of positive selection. simulators that do support positive selection (e.g.) suffer from the performance limitations of the traditional coalescent, and do not support all commonly needed features (variable genetic maps, gene conversion, structured populations) within a single framework. here, we describe the simulator cosi2, which implements the standard coalescent simulation algorithm but which does so using several optimizations that greatly reduce memory and cpu requirements. the use of the original coalescent allows cosi2 to support simulation of positive selection using the standard structured coalescent approach. for additional efficiency, the markovian approximation can be enabled while retaining support for simulating selection. cosi2 supports population structure, population size changes, bottlenecks and migrations. recombination rate can be varied along the simulated region, and the program includes a utility to generate genetic maps with recombination hotspots. cosi2 also supports a simple model of gene conversion.
