isomif finder: online detection of binding site molecular interaction field similarities isomif finder is an online server for the identification of molecular interaction field (mif) similarities. user defined binding site mifs can be compared to datasets of pre-calculated mifs or against a user-defined list of pdb entries. the interface can be used for the prediction of function, identification of potential cross-reactivity or polypharmacological targets and drug repurposing. detected similarities can be viewed in a browser or within a pymol session. availability and implementation: isomif finder uses jsmol (no java plugin required), is cross-browser and freely available at bcb.med.usherbrooke.ca/imfi.
