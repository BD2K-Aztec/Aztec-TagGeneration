gene expression odes: an overlapping dense sub-graph algorithm enumeration of the dense sub-graphs of a graph is of interest in community discovery and membership problems, including dense sub-graphs that overlap each other. described herein is odes (overlapping dense sub-graphs), pthreads parallelized software to extract all overlapping maximal sub-graphs whose densities are greater than or equal to a specified cutoff density of at least 1/2. availability and implementation: http://dense.sf.netalgorithms that infer community membership are important in a number of network problems . in an algorithm like codense , mrna interaction maps are generated from microarray data and represented as graphs, where vertices are mrnas and edges are expression correlations. one is interested in enumerating those groups of mrnas that have high-correlated expression over different conditions, suggesting that proteins produced from such mrnas interact with one another in biological modules. modules have high connectivity between members, and thus would form dense sub-graphs within a map. mrnas belonging to more than one module lie in the intersection of dense sub-graphs, and algorithms that delineate the modules must be able to distinguish overlapping dense sub-graphs. we describe herein an exact algorithm to find, within some large graph, overlapping maximal dense sub-graphs whose densities are greater than or equal to a specified cutoff density of at least 1/2, where density of a graph with e edges and n vertices is defined as the number of edges divided by the total number of possible edges, i.e. 2e/n(n1), and where maximal denotes that the inclusion of an additional vertex would lower the density below the cutoff. the algorithm constrains the brute force search-space, yielding acceptable performance on dense subgraphs of 20 vertices.
