structural bioinformatics 3dmol.js: molecular visualization with webgl 3dmol.js is a modern, object-oriented javascript library that uses the latest web technologies to provide interactive, hardware-accelerated three-dimensional representations of molecular data without the need to install browser plugins or java. 3dmol.js provides a full featured api for developers as well as a straightforward declarative interface that lets users easily share and embed molecular data in websites. availability and implementation: 3dmol.js is distributed under the permissive bsd open source license. source code and documentation can be found at http://3dmol.csb.molecular visualization is an essential tool for computational chemists and biologists. due to the demanding nature of three-dimensional (3d) graphics, most molecular viewers are desktop applications. the need to install specialized applications and, in some cases, the restrictive nature of the software licenses, introduces hurdles to the sharing of molecular data. unlike a desktop application, a standards-based client-side web application comes pre-installed with every computer and mobile device with a modern web browser and can be seamlessly integrated into online environments for accessing and analyzing molecular data. currently, jmol (http://www.jmol.org) is the most used web-based molecular viewer. jmol is implemented as a java applet and includes a custom rendering engine for efficiently rendering common molecular data representations, such as spheres and sticks. due to this custom rendering engine and javas optimizing just-in-time compiler, the performance of jmol can approach that of native, desktop applications. however, due to heavily publicized security failures, the java install base is shrinking . even when java is installed, users are presented with multiple security prompts that must be correctly navigated before a java applet, such as jmol, can run. to address these concerns, jsmol was developed. jsmol is the product of applying a java to javascript translator to jmol. however, particularly for large and complex visualizations, the performance of jsmol lags behind that of jmol. an alternative to the software-based rendering of jmol/jsmol is to use hardware-accelerated graphics, as is done with desktop applications. this is enabled by the recently adopted webgl 1.0 standard, which is now supported natively by all major desktop and mobile browsers. pv (http://biasmv.github.io/pv) and glmol (http:// webglmol.sourceforge.jp) are two examples of webgl-based molecular viewers. glmol was the first webgl viewer and uses the three.js (http://threejs.org) framework for interfacing with webgl. however, glmol lacks a full featured api and the use of the three.js library results in performance inefficiencies. we forked glmol and radically reworked its architecture to overcome these deficiencies and create 3dmol.js. pv, like 3dmol.js, uses webgl directly, but has a focus on displaying protein structures and does not provide the same set of features as 3dmol.js.3dmol.js is an high-performance interactive viewer for 3d molecular data that requires no plugins to work in modern desktop and mobile web browsers. 3dmol.js provides a full-featured api to javascript developers, but can also be used by html authors and
