systems biology sed-ed, a workflow editor for computational biology experiments written in sed-ml the simulation experiment description markup language (sed-ml) is a new community data standard to encode computational biology experiments in a computer-readable xml format. its widespread adoption will require the development of software support to work with sed-ml files. here, we describe a software tool, sed-ed, to view, edit, validate and annotate sed-ml documents while shielding end-users from the underlying xml representation. sed-ed supports modellers who wish to create, understand and further develop a simulation description provided in sed-ml format. availability and implementation: sed-ed is available as a standalone java application, as an eclipse plug-in and as an sbsi (www.sbsi.ed.ac.uk) plug-in, all under an mit open-source license. source code is at https://sed-ed-sedmleditor.googlecode. com/svn.the simulation experiment description markup language (sed-ml) is an xml language that aims to describe computational biology experiments so that they may be reproduced and exchanged between different software tools. in brief, sed-ml level 1 encodes uniform time course simulation descriptions. it describes from where to obtain a model, the type of simulation to run and the content and presentation of the simulation output. sedml is designed to be machine-readable rather than human-readable, and to most modellers, sed-ml should be largely hidden. however, there is a need for curators and sed-ml document editors to easily view, annotate and validate sed-ml files without being exposed to the underlying xml. sed-ed is an application designed to address the needs of these users.
