a scalable and portable framework for massively parallel variable selection in genetic association studies the deluge of data emerging from high-throughput sequencing technologies poses large analytical challenges when testing for association to disease. we introduce a scalable framework for variable selection, implemented in c++ and opencl, that fits regularized regression across multiple graphics processing units. open source code and documentation can be found at a google code repository under the url http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.as the cost of sequencing continues to drop exponentially, it will soon be practical to test all variation in the genome for association to disease using data from thousands of individuals. there are obvious computational challenges in analyzing datasets on this scale. regularized regression methods such as the lasso and other extensions are appropriate tools for selecting important variables in problems where variables far exceed observations. programs like glmnet are computationally efficient for small to moderately sized datasets, but do not scale to extremely large datasets due to memory burden. we introduce an object-oriented framework that scales across nodes on graphics processing unit (gpu) clusters yet shields users from the underlying complexities of a distributed optimization algorithm, allowing them to easily implement custom monte carlo routines (e.g. permutation testing, bootstrapping, etc.). practical use of our framework is demonstrated by an application to real and simulated data.in the first example, we demonstrate how a mixed l1 and l2 penalization scheme can be beneficial for rare variant analyses by carrying out a simulation study based on real data from pilot 3 of the 1000 genomes project. we assigned 100 genic snps, most of which had a minor allele frequency 0.01 to be causal with a relative risk of disease of 2.0., which presents power as a function of false discovery rate (fdr), shows that, as expected, inclusion of a mixed penalty (in this specific case, l1 = l2) can improve power over a pure l1 penalty when informative groupings (i.e. genes) are defined. in our second example, we apply the method of stability selection , which has been demonstrated to provide good error control in gene expression data, to a large gwas on prostate cancer genotyped across 1 047 986 snps on 9641 african-american men . we fit the model across 100 subsampled replicates of the data, completing analysis in slightly under 3.5 h. based on our benchmarks , we estimate this analysis would have completed in 9 days on a single cpu using the same algorithm.presents the three variables declared as being stable based on a threshold (derived as a function of a pure l1 penalty) that controls fdr at the 0.05 level. the first two snps listed in the table replicate significant findings in earlier studies of prostate cancer while the last snp appears to be a genuinely novel risk variant as we have recently replicated this finding in an independent stage 2 analysis .all reported variables based on a threshold thr = 0.506 which controls fdr at 0.05
