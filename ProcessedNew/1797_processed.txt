fast stochastic algorithm for simulating evolutionary population dynamics motivation: many important aspects of evolutionary dynamics can only be addressed through simulations. however, accurate simulations of realistically large populations over long periods of time needed for evolution to proceed are computationally expensive. mutants can be present in very small numbers and yet (if they are more fit than others) be the key part of the evolutionary process. this leads to significant stochasticity that needs to be accounted for. different evolutionary events occur at very different time scales: mutations are typically much rarer than reproduction and deaths. results: we introduce a new exact algorithm for fast fully stochastic simulations of evolutionary dynamics that include birth, death and mutation events. it produces a significant speedup compared to direct stochastic simulations in a typical case when the population size is large and the mutation rates are much smaller than birth and death rates. the algorithm performance is illustrated by several examples that include evolution on a smooth and rugged fitness landscape. we also show how this algorithm can be adapted for approximate simulations of more complex evolutionary problems and illustrate it by simulations of a stochastic competitive growth model.natural evolution is an inherently stochastic process of population dynamics driven by mutations and selection, and the details of such evolutionary dynamics are increasingly becoming accessible via experimental investigation . the importance of stochasticity comes from the fact that populations are always finite, mutations are random and rare, and at least initially, new mutants are present in small numbers. this realization prompted intensive studies of stochastic effects in evolutionary dynamics . most of the models in these studies consider a reproducing population of individuals which are endowed with to whom correspondence should be addressed. genomes that can mutate and thus affect either reproduction or death rate, as with the classical wrightfisher and moran models which describe a fixed population of replicating individuals. specific models vary in the details of fitness calculation and mutation rules, but recent theoretical studies of even relatively simple models lead to non-trivial predictions on the rate of evolution as a function of the population size and the details of the fitness landscape . however, the complexity of more realistic evolutionary models makes them analytically intractable and requires researchers to resort to direct numerical simulations in order to gain quantitative understanding of underlying dynamics. on the most basic level, an evolutionary process is a markov chain of discrete reactions of birth, deaths and mutations within a population of individuals. a direct and exact way of computing individual evolutionary trajectories is to use the stochastic simulation algorithm (ssa;) or its variants , in which birth, death and mutation events are treated as markovian reactions. unfortunately, for realistically large population sizes, direct stochastic simulation of even simple models becomes prohibitively expensive. hence, there is an acute need for developing accelerated methods of stochastic simulations of evolutionary processes. such methods usually involve approximations to the exact stochastic process based on certain small or large parameters that characterize the problem (for example, population size or mutation rates). several approximate methods have been developed in recent years in the context of stochastic biochemical kinetics . recently,proposed an approximate hybrid algorithm suitable for simulation of evolutionary dynamics by combining the -leap algorithm appropriate for abundant sub-populations that do not change their sizes much between individual events, and the direct ssa algorithm for small sub-populations. this method allows one to use large time steps during which multiple birth and death reactions may have occurred. however, it slows down dramatically after a new mutant has been produced, since the algorithm resorts to the direct ssa for all events in which the new mutants are involved until the population of the new mutant class reaches a pre-defined threshold.in this article, we have proposed an algorithm, which can be used to sample exactly co-evolving species that do not interact between mutations, and faithfully approximate the evolution of weakly-interacting species. bnb algorithm not only accounts for the stochastic fluctuations that arise due to the random nature of genetic mutations, but it also accounts for the small-number fluctuations due to the growth of new species that are spawned as single cells. each iteration of the bnb algorithm generates the time of the next mutation and the abundances of all species just after the mutation. this algorithm is exact when the birth, death and mutation rates do not change between consecutive mutations. although similar in spirit to approximate leaping schemes developed for modeling stiff stochastic chemical kinetics , it differs significantly by providing an
