structural bioinformatics assemble: an interactive graphical tool to analyze and build rna architectures at the 2d and 3d levels assemble is an intuitive graphical interface to analyze, manipulate and build complex 3d rna architectures. it provides several advanced and unique features within the framework of a semi-automated modeling process that can be performed by homology and ab initio with or without electron density maps. those include the interactive editing of a secondary structure and a searchable, embedded library of annotated tertiary structures. assemble helps users with performing recurrent and otherwise tedious tasks in structural rna research. availability and implementation: assemble is released under an open-source license (mit license) and is freely available at http://bioinformatics.org/assemble. it is implemented in the java language and runs on macosx, linux and windows operating systems.rna molecules are able to adopt intricate 3d folds. the number of rna tertiary structures has increased dramatically in recent years. together with genomic sequence data, these structural data have sharpened our understanding of rna structure and folding. by exploiting this body of knowledge, 3d architectures of rna molecules can be produced using various molecular modeling strategies. such theoretical approaches have proven to be valuable in the past for understanding folding and function. we describe here a new graphical tool, assemble, which combines automated and manual protocols within an iterative modeling process. the modeling can be performed, either ab initio or by homology, on the basis of sequence alignment, chemical probing data and electron density maps derived by crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy.
