sequence analysis samblaster: fast duplicate marking and structural variant read extraction motivation: illumina dna sequencing is now the predominant source of raw genomic data, and data volumes are growing rapidly. bioinformatic analysis pipelines are having trouble keeping pace. a common bottleneck in such pipelines is the requirement to read, write, sort and compress large bam files multiple times. results: we present samblaster, a tool that reduces the number of times such costly operations are performed. samblaster is designed to mark duplicates in read-sorted sam files as a piped post-pass on dna aligner output before it is compressed to bam. in addition , it can simultaneously output into separate files the discordant read-pairs and/or split-read mappings used for structural variant calling. as an alignment post-pass, its own runtime overhead is negligible, while dramatically reducing overall pipeline complexity and runtime. as a stand-alone duplicate marking tool, it performs significantly better than picard or sambamba in terms of both speed and memory usage, while achieving nearly identical results. availability and implementation: samblaster is open-source c++ code and freely available for download from https://github. com/gregoryfaust/samblaster.
