drug susceptibility prediction against a panel of drugs using kernelized bayesian multitask learning motivation: human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) and cancer require personalized therapies owing to their inherent heterogeneous nature. for both diseases, large-scale pharmacogenomic screens of molecularly characterized samples have been generated with the hope of identifying genetic predictors of drug susceptibility. thus, computational algorithms capable of inferring robust predictors of drug responses from genomic information are of great practical importance. most of the existing computational studies that consider drug susceptibility prediction against a panel of drugs formulate a separate learning problem for each drug, which cannot make use of commonalities between subsets of drugs. results: in this study, we propose to solve the problem of drug susceptibility prediction against a panel of drugs in a multitask learning framework by formulating a novel bayesian algorithm that combines kernel-based non-linear dimensionality reduction and binary classification (or regression). the main novelty of our method is the joint bayesian formulation of projecting data points into a shared subspace and learning predictive models for all drugs in this subspace, which helps us to eliminate off-target effects and drug-specific experimental noise. another novelty of our method is the ability of handling missing phenotype values owing to experimental conditions and quality control reasons. we demonstrate the performance of our algorithm via cross-validation experiments on two benchmark drug susceptibility datasets of hiv and cancer. our method obtains statistically significantly better predictive performance on most of the drugs compared with baseline single-task algorithms that learn drug-specific models. these results show that predicting drug susceptibility against a panel of drugs simultaneously within a multitask learning framework improves overall predictive performance over single-task learning approaches. availability and implementation: our matlab implementations for binary classification and regression are available at https://github. com/human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) and cancer, which are two major human diseases causing millions of deaths yearly, require personalized therapies owing to their inherent heterogenous nature. for both diseases, large-scale pharmacogenomic screens have been performed with the hope of discovering associations between genetic subtypes of each disease and drug susceptibility . hiv is usually treated with antiretroviral therapies, which have demonstrated high efficacy. however, the high mutation rate of hiv helps the virus adapt fast, leading to drug-resistant viral strains. thus, selecting the optimal therapeutic regimen for a given hiv strain requires the ability to predict drug resistance based on its genomic sequence. to enable this type of discovery,characterize the susceptibility of 41000 genomically sequenced hiv strains to subsets of multiple hiv therapeutic agents. cancer is a collection of genetically diverse diseases, and many modern cancer therapeutics have demonstrated selective efficacy in specific matched genetic subtypes . thus, patient selection strategies for personalized cancer therapeutics require the ability to predict drug sensitivity based on molecular information about a patients tumor. for this purpose,characterize the sensitivity of 4500 molecularly profiled cancer cell lines to 24 and 138 anticancer compounds, respectively. for both hiv and cancer, researchers have developed genomic predictors of drug susceptibility using modern machine learning techniques for high-dimensional classification or regression. for example,use machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, least squares regression and least angle regression to predict drug resistance in hiv type 1 (hiv-1) using the sequence of the viral reverse transcriptase.use a regularized regression method (elastic net) to predict drug sensitivities based on cancer cell line molecular profiles, andformulate a bayesian extension of this approach in a recent study.combine genomic features of cell lines and chemical features of drugs for sensitivity prediction using a neural network approach.compare the performance of various machine learning methods applied to the cancer cell line datasets. one potential limitation of these approaches is the formulation of a separate learning task for each drug. in particular, because each pharmacogenomic screen profiles multiple drugs with similar mechanisms of action, leveraging information across multiple related drugs may yield improved model robustness by reducing the impact of off-target effects and drug-specific experimental noise. moreover, methods that jointly model sensitivity profiles across multiple drugs may yield insights into groups of drugs effecting similar biological processes or infer mechanisms of action for uncharacterized compounds. for example,combine elastic net regression with an expectation to whom correspondence should be addressed. y present address: department of biomedical engineering, oregon health & science university, 3303 sw bond avenue, portland, or 97239, usa the author 2014. published

maximization algorithm to simultaneously cluster groups of similarly behaving compounds and infer a predictive model for each cluster.formulate predicting drug resistance against a panel of hiv-1 drugs as a multilabel learning problem , which aims to use all available information by learning models for all drugs simultaneously. they show that this joint modeling approach is better than independent modeling in terms of predictive performance. however, their algorithm has some limitations: (i) it is based on the classifier chains formulation (i.e. training separate predictors for all drugs successively linked along a chain) , which is not sufficient to capture more complex dependencies between drugs. (ii) it assumes that each data point have the corresponding drug resistance score for all of the drugs considered (i.e. no missing output), which limits the applicability of the proposed method because, in large-scale pharmacogenomic assays, there may be many missing values owing to experimental conditions, quality control reasons, etc. for predicting drug susceptibility against a panel of drugs, we propose a novel bayesian formulation that combines kernelbased non-linear dimensionality reduction (sch olkopf and) and binary classification (or regression) in a multitask learning framework , which tries to solve distinct but related tasks jointly to improve overall generalization performance. our proposed method, called kernelized bayesian multitask learning (kbmtl), has two key properties: (i) it maps all data points into a shared subspace and learns predictive models for all drugs simultaneously in this subspace to capture commonalities between the drugs. joint modeling of drugs enables us to eliminate off-target effects and drug-specific experimental noise, leading to a better predictive performance. (ii) it can handle missing values of drug susceptibility measurements, which enables us not to discard data points with missing outputs, leading to larger data collections. as a result, the obtained predictions become more robust especially for drugs with a large number of missing phenotype values. to show the performance gain of our method over standard modeling approaches, we perform cross-validation experiments on two benchmark drug susceptibility datasets of hiv and cancer.in this study, we consider the problem of drug susceptibility prediction based on pharmacogenomic screens against a panel of drugs. in contrast to earlier studies, we choose to solve this problem with a multitask learning formulation by considering each drug as a distinct task and learning a unified model forthe scatterplots give the auroc values of the best baseline algorithm and kbmtl for 50 replications on the x-and y-axes, respectively. for comparison, blue: kbmtl is better;
