sequence analysis orman: optimal resolution of ambiguous rna-seq multimappings in the presence of novel isoforms motivation: rna-seq technology is promising to uncover many novel alternative splicing events, gene fusions and other variations in rna transcripts. for an accurate detection and quantification of transcripts, it is important to resolve the mapping ambiguity for those rna-seq reads that can be mapped to multiple loci: 417 of the reads from mouse rna-seq data and 50 of the reads from some plant rna-seq data have multiple mapping loci. in this study, we show how to resolve the mapping ambiguity in the presence of novel transcriptomic events such as exon skipping and novel indels towards accurate downstream analysis. we introduce orman (optimal resolution of multimapping ambiguity of rna-seq reads), which aims to compute the minimum number of potential transcript products for each gene and to assign each multimapping read to one of these transcripts based on the estimated distribution of the region covering the read. orman achieves this objective through a combinatorial optimization formulation, which is solved through well-known approximation algorithms, integer linear programs and heuristics. results: on a simulated rna-seq dataset including a random subset of transcripts from the ucsc database, the performance of several state-of-the-art methods for identifying and quantifying novel transcripts, such as cufflinks, isolasso and cliiq, is significantly improved through the use of orman. furthermore, in an experiment using real rna-seq reads, we show that orman is able to resolve multimapping to produce coverage values that are similar to the original distribution, even in genes with highly non-uniform coverage. availability: orman is

rna-seq data helps to uncover many novel alternative splicing events, gene fusions and other variations in rna transcripts. unfortunately, there are many rna-seq reads that can be mapped to several loci equally well, and it is of key importance to resolve their mapping ambiguity in order to perform a comprehensive and accurate analysis of the whole rna-seq data. there are several mappers that can align rna-seq reads to a reference genome or previously known transcript sequences . owing to the presence of paralogs and homologous regions within a gene, rna-seq mappers typically report a fraction of multireads, i.e. reads that map to multiple loci on a reference genome. based on tophat mappings on the human reference genome, $10 of human rna-seq reads are multireads. similarly, $17 of mouse and 50 of some plant rna-seq reads are multireads . the presence of multireads complicates the downstream analysis such as determining alternative splicing patterns, gene fusions and other variations. the common practice for handling multireads is ignoring them in the downstream analysis. this leads to inaccurate estimation of the abundance of expressed transcripts . a simple approach for determining the exact genomic location of a multiread is rescue . here, the initial gene expression values are calculated based on the unique reads that map to them. each multiread is then assigned to the gene with the fraction equal to the ratio between the genes initial expression value and the total expression value of all genes that the multiread maps to. a more complex approach based on expected maximization (em) is designed to handle mapping ambiguity of a read to two or more homologous genesfor the purpose of determining the expression value of each of these genes and not to determine or quantify isoforms. finally, rsem , isoem and ireckon are em methods based on statistical generative models for sequencing processes to resolve mapping ambiguity. to whom correspondence should be addressed. y the authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first four authors should be regarded as joint first authors. many of the above approaches are designed specially for estimating expression values of known/annotated isoforms. their performance is highly dependent on the completeness of the isoform database in use. furthermore, they cannot handle alternative splicing events such as novel exon skipping, alternative 5 0 donor and 3 0 acceptor sites, intron retention and other structural differences such as insertions or deletions. some recent computational approaches, in particular isolasso , cliiq and cufflinks , can identify and quantify unknown isoforms and certain types of transcriptomic variations. unfortunately, neither isolasso nor cliiq takes into account multireads, and cufflinks handles multireads through a simple rescue-based approach. in this article, we show how to resolve the multimapping ambiguity in the presence of novel isoforms involving exon skipping, intron retention and small indels towards accurate downstream analysis. to be mathematically precise, we introduce the notion of a partial transcripta substring of a potential transcript product of a gene, which satisfies certain conditions (a formal definition is provided in the next section). the objective of our multiread resolution approach, orman (optimal resolution of multimapping ambiguity of rna-seq reads), is (i) to compute the minimum number of partial transcripts that cover all the multireads and (ii) to assign each multiread to one of these partial transcripts such that each partial transcript is covered according to the estimated local distribution. we achieve the first objective approximately through a reduction to the standard set cover problem. we achieve the second objective through an integer linear programming formulation, which we handle using available integer linear program (ilp) solvers such as cplex, or through greedy heuristics we describe in this article. we evaluate orman on both simulated and real human rna-seq datasets. for the first experiment, we generate paired-end rna-seq reads from a random subset of transcripts from the university of california, santa cruz (ucsc) database with the expression distribution modelled after a real human dataset. on this simulated data, we show that the performance of state-of-the-art methods for identifying and quantifying transcripts such as cliiq, cufflinks and isolasso is typically improved through the use of our multiread resolution approach. notably, when combined with isolasso or cliiq, orman gives the most accurate and comprehensive novel isoform detection and quantification pipeline available. to evaluate orman in a more real world setting, we also design an experiment using real rna-seq data from a cancer patient . for this experiment, we implant artificial genomic repeats into several genes and compare the performance of orman with that of rescue in resolving the multireads mapping to these regions. we show that on this dataset, the multiread assignment by orman approximates the original distributions quite well with a maximum relative error of 0.3.
