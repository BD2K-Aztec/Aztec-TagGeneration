systems biology derivative processes for modelling metabolic fluxes motivation: one of the challenging questions in modelling biological systems is to characterize the functional forms of the processes that control and orchestrate molecular and cellular phenotypes. recently proposed methods for the analysis of metabolic pathways, for example, dynamic flux estimation, can only provide estimates of the underlying fluxes at discrete time points but fail to capture the complete temporal behaviour. to describe the dynamic variation of the fluxes, we additionally require the assumption of specific functional forms that can capture the temporal behaviour. however, it also remains unclear how to address the noise which might be present in experimentally measured metabolite concentrations. results: here we propose a novel approach to modelling metabolic fluxes: derivative processes that are based on multiple-output gaussian processes (mgps), which are a flexible non-parametric bayesian modelling technique. the main advantages that follow from mgps approach include the natural non-parametric representation of the fluxes and ability to impute the missing data in between the measurements. our derivative process approach allows us to model changes in metabolite derivative concentrations and to characterize the temporal behaviour of metabolic fluxes from time course data. because the derivative of a gaussian process is itself a gaussian process, we can readily link metabolite concentrations to metabolic fluxes and vice versa. here we discuss how this can be implemented in an mgp framework and illustrate its application to simple models, including nitrogen metabolism in escherichia coli.it is generally impossible to simultaneously measure the abundance of all the molecular entities making up biological systems. in gene expression assays, for example, we typically measure messenger rna expression, but not the activity of transcription factors and/or the occupancy of transcription-factor binding sites. similarly, in metabolomic analyses , key metabolites can be measured using, e.g. mass spectrometry or nuclear magnetic resonance quantification, but it is rarely possible to comprehensively quantify the metabolites even within a single pathway. typically, more interesting than metabolite and enzyme abundance are the fluxes through biochemical reactions and metabolic networks . fluxes, 1 ,. .. , m t , correspond to the rates at which molecules, x x 1 ,. .. , x n t , are turned over by the m reactions; regulation of fluxes in light of changes in environmental and physiological conditions is also intimately linked to cellular physiology. although the fluxes are of central concern, they are hard to measure directly. estimates for intracellular fluxes can be obtained by tracking products from isotope-labeled ( 13 c and 15 n metabolic flux analysis) metabolites through the metabolic network . however, such an approach is restricted to a metabolically steady-state analysis and is not appropriate for capturing dynamical flux variations. instead, theoretical analysis has often progressed by assuming stationarity of the metabolic processes, which in turn allows for characterizing the sets of steady-state fluxes under a set of suitable assumptions . flux-balance analysis is the most popular example of this strategy, but it becomes questionable once the steady-state assumption can no longer be upheld. furthermore, as more data on enzyme abundance become available, we should attempt to include such information and the impact on metabolic processes . here we provide a new framework that allows us to model metabolic fluxes and their dynamics, and which deals with the missing data problem in metabolic analysis in a flexible and consistent manner. gaussian processes (gp) belong to the armoury of nonparametric bayesian methods and have been widely used to describe dynamical processes and to infer hidden states, e.g. transcription-factor activities . in applications to metabolic modelling, parametric approaches can offer potentially incorrect representations of the underlying fluxes . the strengths of gp models arise from their non-parametric nature, which enables us to put priors directly on a function rather than on the parameters of a parametric function. with a multiple-output gps (mgps), single gp framework can be extended to handle many outputs, enabling us to learn the unknown relationships between metabolic species. in turn, mgps can be used to infill the sparsely sampled data . this means that by using mgps, it is possible to impute the missing data in between the metabolic measurements more efficiently. here we develop a more general framework that uses so-called derivative gps , which allow us to link to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. metabolite abundance, x (or concentrations) and fluxes. this in turn enables us to also treat time course data on metabolites and monitor the changes that occur in fluxes, e.g. over the course of physiological responses, such as to changes in the environment .
