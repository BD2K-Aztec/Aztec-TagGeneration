systems biology systematic parameter estimation in data-rich environments for cell signalling dynamics motivation: computational models of biological signalling networks, based on ordinary differential equations (odes), have generated many insights into cellular dynamics, but the model-building process typically requires estimating rate parameters based on experimentally observed concentrations. new proteomic methods can measure concentrations for all molecular species in a pathway; this creates a new opportunity to decompose the optimization of rate parameters. results: in contrast with conventional parameter estimation methods that minimize the disagreement between simulated and observed concentrations , the spedre method fits spline curves through observed concentration points, estimates derivatives and then matches the derivatives to the production and consumption of each species. this reformulation of the problem permits an extreme decomposition of the high-dimensional optimization into a product of low-dimensional factors, each factor enforcing the equality of one ode at one time slice. coarsely discretized solutions to the factors can be computed systematically. then the discrete solutions are combined using loopy belief propagation, and refined using local optimization. spedre has unique asymptotic behaviour with runtime polynomial in the number of molecules and timepoints, but exponential in the degree of the biochemical network. spedre performance is comparatively evaluated on a novel model of akt activation dynamics including redox-mediated inactivation of pten (phosphatase and tensin homologue). availability and implementation: web service, software and supplementary information are available at www.ltklab.org/spedredynamic behaviours of biochemical networks can be captured by ordinary differential equation (ode) models that compute the change of molecular concentrations with respect to time . for most biochemical pathways with known topology, most reaction rate constants (i.e. the coefficients of the differential equations) are not available from direct experiments. rate parameters are typically estimated by regression, in other words by fitting the global behaviour of the simulated model to the experimentally observed concentrations. this is a difficult high-dimensional non-linear problem, and search strategies often experience poor convergence and local optima . the rate parameter estimation problem can naturally be formulated as minimizing a sum of squared errors (sse), where each error is a difference between simulated concentration and observed concentration, and the summation is over time points and/or experimental treatments. optimizing this type of sse objective function can be attacked using a variety of traditional global and local search methods: lm (levenbergmarquardt, local), sd (steepest descent, local), sres (stochastic ranking evolution strategy, global), pso (particle swarm optimization, global) and ga (genetic algorithm, global) . local and global search methods both have drawbacks, and global local hybrid searches have also become popular . traditional search methods generate a full vector of rate parameters, simulate the model with this full set of parameters and then accept, reject or adjust the parameters based on how well the simulation agrees with experimental measurements. for networks with few unknown parameters, these simulate-and-match methods have been successful at finding good values, or multiple good candidates. the search space for parameter vectors is exponential, and the inevitable trend with any type of exponential growth is that there will eventually be a large enough number of unknown parameters, such that reasonable sampling will not explore very many of the basins of convergence, and the results will deteriorate. indeed many high-impact models of biological pathways continue to be built without automating the parameter estimation process . to whom correspondence should be addressed the author 2013. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the

protein over time to interpolate the time derivative of the concentration, rather than computing the derivatives based on simulating the odes. traditional methods minimize the violation of experimental observations, subject to obeying the ode trajectories, while the spline-based collocation methods can be seen as optimizing a dual-like objective function because they minimize the violation of the ode trajectories, subject to obeying the experimental observations. note that the spline-based collocation methods require an extensive input dataset with observations for many or all of the proteins. in the past, few large networks had such comprehensive measurements available, but recent trends in proteomic technology suggest that data-rich cases may be increasingly common in the future. several spline-based collocation methods have been published recently for the context of biological networks. a spline-based collocation scheme for parameter fitting problems using a modified data-smoothing method and a generalization of profiled estimation was proposed by. a similar method for problems with high noise and short time-course was introduced by. zhan and yeung (2011) used non-linear programming (nlp) to optimize the dual objective. several decoupling strategies also use some forms of slope approximation from time-series data to avoid doing multiple simulations. estimating ode parameters has been studied in the mathematical literature for decades, and an important class of data-rich methods called multiple shooting (, b) has recently been applied to biological networks . to the best of our knowledge, no data-rich parameter estimation methods have implementations publicly available for practical problems with biological networks. the asymptotic runtime of data-rich methods has also been neglected. many data-rich methods have been published with claims of good accuracy, but to the best of our knowledge, efficiency and runtime have not yet been compared with state-of-the-art, simulate-and-match parameter estimation methods. scalability with network size is a major remaining challenge in the parameter estimation field, regardless of the objective function or optimization approach. a common strategy for large systems is to decompose the problem. however, the objective functions of parameter estimation are not generally decomposable. some decomposition approaches exploit specific situations, such as having derivatives available at all timepoints , or having small sub-networks connected by species with observed concentrations . the dual-like objective functions of spline-based collocation methods are not readily decomposable, but they do exhibit the important property of sparse interdependence (locality) between the variables. this locality can be a basis for conditional decomposition. belief propagation [see review and textbook] is an inference method for probabilistic graphical networks with sparse interdependence or locality. it can compute the maximum a posteriori (map) values for variable parameters in a factor graph, given joint probability distributions that describe the dependencies between adjacent variables. for acyclic graphs, belief propagation guarantees exact optima, and for general graphs, a variant called loopy belief propagation (lbp) has had empirical success at approximating the map . our method of systematic parameter estimation in data-rich environments (spedre) optimizes the dual objective approximately, via lbp. the innovation is conditional decomposition of the problem into local terms, with pre-computed look-up tables for the discretized solutions to the local terms of the dual objective function. spedre provides dramatic improvement in empirical efficiency, and in effect brings the spline-based collocation (dual objective) methods to the same level of efficiency as the state-of-the-art (primal objective) methods. asymptotic runtime is polynomial with respect to the number of species, parameters and timepoints in the biological networks, while it is exponential only in the degree of the network. finally, we compare the scalability and robustness of spedre against state-of-the-art standalone and hybrid parameter estimation methods, using both a spectrum of artificial cases, and also a novel model of akt activation based on our previous experimental studies of akt . aberrant hyper-activation of the akt pathway has been detected in up to 50 of all human tumours, and the akt pathway is an attractive target for anti-cancer drug discovery . our model of akt includes oxidative inactivation of the lipid phosphatase and tensin homologue on chromosome 10 (pten), as well as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (pi3k) activation, as competing regulators of akt in serum-stimulated fibroblasts . a more detailed understanding of pten dynamics is important because many cancers activate akt through disruptions of pten.before testing the overall performance of the method on full problems, we first performed simplistic tests with partial problems, to isolate specific variables of interest such as species and timepoints. we monitored performance as a function of network size and timepoint spacing, to probe two sources of potential error in the spedre-base method: spline accuracy and the pof objective function. the simplistic tests used ring-shaped networks , with nominal parameters randomly chosen to be at exact mid-points of the parameter discretization bins. simulated data were generated with random initial concentrations, using the nominal rate parameters. for each run of spedre-base, we monitored the objective normalized logpof logpof n t n s 2 , 9 normalized with respect to the number of factors in the product of equation (9). the objective declined when the number of timepoints increased , indicating as expected that spedre gives better estimates of the parameters when timepoints are densely sampled. next we compared the normalized log(pof) value between the results of spedre-base, and the nominal (correct) rate constants, using 10 time steps (i.e. 11 timepoints) for each test.shows that the pof scores of the exact nominal parameters were higher than the pof scores of the parameters found by spedre-base, for all networks of significant size. because spedre-base found parameters with better scores than the correct parameters, we infer that the pof objective is an imperfect score of parameter accuracy.the key innovations of spedre are the use of a probabilistic graphical model to decompose the dual objective function, and pre-computation of discrete solutions to each sub-problem. the method has a well-defined asymptotic runtime and good scalability, in exchange for approximate heuristic optimization. the spedre approach aims for asymptotic scalability at the expense of accuracy. this philosophy appears in (i) the use of splines to approximate the species derivative, (ii) the use of binning to discretize the parameter space and (iii) the use of lbp for probabilistic inference. each of these elements can introduce error. we believed the dangers of compounded errors would make the spedre method less robust to noisy data than simulation-based methods. the expected sensitivity of spedre to input noise has not yet been confirmed in the tests shown (and in other tests, such as supplementary); rather we found that all methods gave unacceptably poor answers with noisythe accuracy and speed of spedre were compared against several methods of parameter estimation, in low-degree, data-rich test cases. spedre performance was competitive in all tests, and spedre was the best-performing method for the akt network test. we conclude that spedre performs well when tested in the specific niche of problems for which it was designed. naturally the spedre performance would degrade (perhaps exponentially) outside of its intended niche. spedre exhibits an abrupt trade-off between problem type and performance, but performance trade-offs are not new to parameter estimation research. major pathway simulation software packages already maintain collections of multiple parameter estimation methods, rather than expecting a single best method to cover all problems. a current hurdle for broader applicability of spedre is the inability to handle high-degree nodes. many small networks are low-degree, but large networks often have at least one hub. in order for new spline-based collocation methods to be truly superior to conventional (primal objective) parameter estimation methods, they would have to handle high-degree networks and extensive gaps in experimental observations, robustly. future innovations may be able to develop a new composition of parameter estimation methods, so that low-degree sub-problems can be solved by spedre and high-degree hubs can be treated separately. a side-effect of our work is to provide performance comparisons for several hybrid and standalone parameter estimation methods. our tests reproduced the earlier observation that hybrid methods generally perform better than standalone global methods . one surprising phenomenon we observed was that performing a global search prior to a local search sometimes caused the total runtime to be faster than using the local search alone . future work may be able to exploit this non-additive runtime effect, perhaps through deeper integration of global and local search methods, rather than applying independent methods sequentially. a distinguishing feature of spedre is that it requires large amounts of concentration measurement data, which would have been prohibitive a decade ago. traditional experimental methods required an investment of labour and resources that was roughly linear in the number of proteins studied. new proteomic methods can measure additional proteins at virtually no additional cost, and proteomic datasets are starting to provide data-rich environments with measurements of all proteins in a system. silac technology has recently been used for time-series measurements of 147 proteins in nih3t3-derived cells, and again for time-series of 534 proteins in the cytosol and 626 proteins in the nucleus in glucocorticoid-exposed myogenic cells . most proteomic studies have not been performed with time-series repeats for studying dynamics, but large-scale dynamic data will become increasingly available with the explosive growth in the number of proteomic experiments . new studies of large networks will give rise to huge parameter estimation problems, with rich datasets, but with too many unknown parameters for conventional methods to solve. we believe that proteomic technology both enables and requires novel approaches to parameter estimation such as spedre. as models grow in size owing to technological advances, decomposition-based methods will probably dominate nondecomposition-based search methods, which suffer from the curse of dimensionality. the trade-offs exhibited by our method may be increasingly desirable for future trends in parameter estimation.
