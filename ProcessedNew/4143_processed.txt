scell: integrated analysis of single-cell rna-seq data analysis of the composition of heterogeneous tissue has been greatly enabled by recent developments in single-cell transcriptomics. we present scell, an integrated software tool for quality filtering, normalization, feature selection, iterative dimensionality reduction, clustering and the estimation of gene-expression gradients from large ensembles of single-cell rna-seq datasets. scell is open source, and implemented with an intuitive graphical interface. scripts and protocols for the high-throughput pre-processing of large ensembles of single-cell, rna-seq datasets are provided as an additional resource. availability and implementation: binary executables for windows, macos and linux are available atsingle-cell sequencing enables heterogeneity assessments at unprecedented resolution. at a cost comparable to sequencing a sample in bulk, hundreds of single-cell datasets can instead be generated. we present scell, a software tool to perform outlier filtering, to normalize cell-cycle effects, to select genes for dimensionality reduction and to estimate inter-sample expression gradients. several groups have proposed reconstructing the gene-expression kinetics of developmental processes from transcriptomics data, by summarizing gene expression along the backbone of a spanning graph of the samples pca coordinates . as single-cell sequencing becomes more widely adopted, the large number of available samples makes direct regression of gene expression on pca coordinates an attractive alternative. scell can regress/interpolate gene expression on pca space, visualize expression gradients, and estimate expression kinetics along minimum spanning trees and minimum weight paths. these tools are accessible through an interactive, graphical interface.
