pathway discovery in metabolic networks by subgraph extraction motivation: subgraph extraction is a powerful technique to predict pathways from biological networks and a set of query items (e.g. genes, proteins, compounds, etc.). it can be applied to a variety of different data types, such as gene expression, protein levels, operons or phylogenetic profiles. in this article, we investigate different approaches to extract relevant pathways from metabolic networks. although these approaches have been adapted to metabolic networks, they are generic enough to be adjusted to other biological networks as well. results: we comparatively evaluated seven sub-network extraction approaches on 71 known metabolic pathways from saccharomyces cerevisiae and a metabolic network obtained from metacyc. the best performing approach is a novel hybrid strategy, which combines a random walk-based reduction of the graph with a shortest paths-based algorithm, and which recovers the reference pathways with an accuracy of 77. availability: most of the presented algorithms are available as part of the network analysis tool set (neat). the kwalks method is released under the gpl3 license.subgraph extraction can be used to predict a meaningful pathway given a biological network (e.g. proteinprotein interaction or metabolic network) and a set of query items (e.g. genes, proteins and compounds) defining seed nodes in the network (van). this methodology may serve to predict pathways from a variety of data types, such as clusters of co-expressed genes, operons, phylogenetic profiles or protein levels.inferred pathways from a biological network weighted according to gene expression levels as measured with microarrays. they construct a bipartite metabolic network consisting of compound and reaction nodes and subsequently enumerate all possible paths between a source (d-glucose) and a target compound (pyruvate) under certain constraints. the score of each path is computed on the basis of expression values of the genes catalyzing to whom correspondence should be addressed. the enzymes involved in this path. this method ranks predicted paths according to their degree of up-or down-regulation.extended this idea to the extraction of more complex, non-linear sub-networks in proteinprotein and protein dna networks given yeast gene expression data. sub-networks are considered active whenever they involve highly expressed genes. such sub-networks can be identified by sampling the space of possible sub-networks with simulated annealing.also search for sub-networks in proteinprotein and proteindna interaction networks given gene expression data. to our knowledge, they are the first to apply algorithms solving the steiner tree problem on biological networks in order to connect nodes of interest (i.e. differentially expressed genes). rajagopalan and agarwal (2005) integrate various data sources (transfac, humancyc and ingenuity pathways knowledge base) into a network of genemetabolite relationships. query nodes in this network are connected by an algorithm based on breadth-first search. a key contribution of these authors is the systematic evaluation of their subgraph extraction approach on both simulated data and known pathways taken from biocarta.apply sub-network extraction to proteomics data (i.e. enzyme level ratios, measured by mass spectrometry) from the cyanobacterium nostoc. a sub-network is extracted from a weighted kegg metabolic network by generating paths around each up-regulated enzyme node up to a given maximal weight and subsequently filtering these paths according to the number of up-regulated enzymes contained in them. the filtered paths are then merged to form a network whose connected components are considered as the extracted sub-networks.identify high-scoring sub-networks in proteinprotein interaction networks with a strategy similar to, by applying an algorithm that solves the steiner tree problem exactly. interestingly, their method allows to report sub-optimal solutions with a user-specified distance to previously listed solutions. the pathway prediction approach is validated on simulated data. antonov and co-workers predict metabolic pathways from kegg data and from input genes or input compounds . query nodes (genes or compounds) separated by one edge are added to a growing sub-network that may consist of several components. the component covering most query nodes is considered as the inferred pathway. the procedure is repeated for distances of 2, 3,... edges, resulting in a set of distance-specific predictions. this sub-network extraction procedure is available via two web tools specific to metabolic data.page: 1212 12111218in this article, we presented different sub-network extraction techniques that can be applied to predict metabolic pathways from metabolic networks, given a set of seed reactions. from our evaluation, we can conclude that a combination of takahashimatsuyama and kwalks is globally most suited. the evaluation also shows that a directed, weighted metabolic network performs better than an undirected, unweighted one. consequently, if a good weight policy for the metabolic network under study is at hand, it should be given as input to both algorithms, else the paths-based algorithm can be launched on the weights computed by kwalks. the accuracy of pathway inference can be further increased by iterating kwalks and/or by reducing the size of the sub-network extracted by kwalks in the first step of the hybrid. the hybrid approach combines the strengths of two different sub-network extraction strategies: kwalks is designed to capture the part of a network that is most relevant to connect the given seed nodes, resulting in a high sensitivity, but at the cost of a low ppv. fps introduced by kwalks can be discarded by a more stringent shortest paths-based algorithm. in addition, combining shortest-paths-based algorithms with kwalks not only increases their accuracy but also their speed. kwalks, as the fastest of all tested algorithms, quickly reduces the input network size and thus the runtime of the subsequent shortest-paths-based algorithm. our pathway prediction approach is subjected to a number of limitations. paths-based approaches only partly infer cyclic or spiralshaped pathways (the same enzymes acting repeatedly on a growing chain, e.g. fatty acid biosynthesis). kwalks alone is able to return general subgraphs but possibly at the cost of decreasing specificity. for certain pathways situated in the densely interconnected region of the metabolic network (such as the tca cycle and the glycolysis pathway), a large number of seed nodes is required in order to distinguish them from alternative pathways. in addition, prediction accuracy is of course dependent on data quality. to infer a metabolic pathway from a metabolic network, the network must contain all nodes and edges of the pathway. a strength of sub-network extraction is its ability to handle large networks (several thousands of nodes) efficiently. the approach is sufficiently generic to be applied to any biological network. in addition, it has a capacity to integrate other data (e.g. scores from high-throughput experiments) by weighting the network. another strength is its capability to handle seed node groups, which allows to cope with ambiguous gene-reaction mappings. the sub-network extraction method proposed here is distinct from and complementary to other metabolic network analysis methods such as flux balance analysis (fba;page: 1217 12111218) or elementary mode (em) analysis . those respective approaches differ by their input types, output types and by their potential applications, and can provide complementary insights into the metabolism of a given organism. fba aims at predicting a set of feasible metabolic flux distributions optimizing a specific objective (such as biomass production) for a given organism in a specific environment. fba requires as input a metabolic network including stoichiometric coefficients plus an objective function to constrain the number of solutions. em analysis is similar to fba, but does not require an objective function. thus, it enumerates all allowable metabolic states satisfying an additional non-decomposability constraint . these methods have important applications in bioengineering, especially for microbe-based production of organic molecules. in contrast, the presented method aims to predict metabolic pathways given a metabolic network and a set of seed nodes, which can be compounds, reactions or enzyme-coding genes. seed genes can be collected from a variety of data sources: co-expression clusters, operons, regulons, synteny groups, metabolomic profiles or any other criterion suggesting that a set of enzyme-coding genes is potentially involved in a common function. an immediate application of sub-network extraction is to interpret expression profiles obtained from microarray data, in order to understand the specific metabolic processes that are up-or downregulated in response to changed conditions. another application is the inference of bacterial metabolic pathways from genome organization (operons, regulons and synteny), and the analysis of cross-species pathway variants. metabolic sub-network extraction can be applied to predict metabolic pathways for an organism whose genes are functionally annotated but whose metabolism is not yet known. in such a case, a network constructed from metabolic information taken from related organisms might be more appropriate than a complete metabolic network containing all known reactions and compounds in a given database as in this study. there are various ways to build and weight an organism-specific metabolic network: the first is to simply build the network from reactions occurring in the selected set of organisms. in a less restrictive approach, the complete network could be weighted in such a way that reactions occurring in the given organisms are favored over other reactions. similarly, gene expression and other high-throughput data could be taken into account during network construction by converting expression ratios (or other scores derived from the dataset) into node weights. the pathway inference algorithms were added to neat at
