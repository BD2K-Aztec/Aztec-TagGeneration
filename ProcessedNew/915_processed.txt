census 2: isobaric labeling data analysis motivation: we introduce census 2, an update of a mass spectrom-etry data analysis tool for peptide/protein quantification. new features for analysis of isobaric labeling, such as tandem mass tag (tmt) or isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (itraq), have been added in this version, including a reporter ion impurity correction, a reporter ion intensity threshold filter and an option for weighted normalization to correct mixing errors. tmt/itraq analysis can be performed on experiments using hcd (high energy collision dissociation) only, cid (collision induced dissociation)/hcd (high energy collision dissociation) dual scans or hcd triple-stage mass spectrometry data. to improve measurement accuracy, we implemented weighted normalization, multiple tandem spectral approach, impurity correction and dynamic intensity threshold features.over the past decade, proteomic analysis by mass spectrometers has become an essential tool for addressing important biological questions. initially, mass spectrometers were used to identify components of a proteome, but now they are commonly used to quantitate proteomic differences induced by different biological conditions. accurate quantitation benefits from a higher resolution mass spectrometer, which often reduces instrument scanning speed. we previously reported the development of the software census that facilitates the quantitation of large proteomic datasets. census was initially developed to analyze ms data using metabolic labeling for quantitation, but it is also capable of analyzing ms data with isobaric tags. with the development of faster high-resolution mass spectrometers, such as thermo scientific tm velos ltq-orbitrap, velos ltq-orbitrap elite, q-exactive and ab sciex triple-tof, quantitation with isobaric tags has become more efficient.after the analysis of a large number of isobaric tag datasets, we have improved census for this increasingly popular quantitation method.
