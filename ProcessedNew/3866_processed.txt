random sampling of elementary flux modes in large-scale metabolic networks motivation: the description of a metabolic network in terms of elementary (flux) modes (ems) provides an important framework for metabolic pathway analysis. however, their application to large networks has been hampered by the combinatorial explosion in the number of modes. in this work, we develop a method for generating random samples of ems without computing the whole set. results: our algorithm is an adaptation of the canonical basis approach, where we add an additional filtering step which, at each iteration, selects a random subset of the new combinations of modes. in order to obtain an unbiased sample, all candidates are assigned the same probability of getting selected. this approach avoids the exponential growth of the number of modes during computation, thus generating a random sample of the complete set of ems within reasonable time. we generated samples of different sizes for a metabolic network of escherichia coli, and observed that they preserve several properties of the full em set. it is also shown that em sampling can be used for rational strain design. a well distributed sample, that is representative of the complete set of ems, should be suitable to most em-based methods for analysis and optimization of metabolic networks. availability: source code for a cross-platform implementation in python is freely available atthe description of a metabolic network in terms of elementary (flux) modes (ems) provides an important framework for metabolic pathway analysis . elementary mode analysis identifies all minimal functional pathways connecting substrates with biomass and products inherent to a metabolic network. ems have been used to understand the cellular metabolism through analysis of the network structure, regulations and characterization of all possible phenotypes . examples of other recent applications of pathway analysis are in the determination of to whom correspondence should be addressed. minimum medium requirements and in the development of reduced kinetic models . they also play an essential role in the development of modelbased metabolic engineering strategies for strain optimization by identification of suitable intervention targets . a comprehensive review on elementary mode analysis and other applications of ems can be found in . ems are also closely related to the problem of identifying all transition invariants (t-invariants) in petri net theory . in fact, if all reactions are irreversible, the set of ems is equivalent to the minimal t-invariants of a petri net. thus, it is not surprising that the algorithms for computation of ems and t-invariants have evolved closelyfor a comparison of. despite recent improvements in the algorithms for computation of ems , their application to real world metabolic networks has been hampered by the combinatorial explosion in the number of modes as the size of the networks increase. the enumeration of the complete set of ems for genome-scale networks has been infeasible so far, and perhaps even undesirable due to the hardly manageable number of modes that would be generated. an attractive approach is the enumeration of a subset of pathways representing the complete system. several approaches have been proposed hereto, though none of them provides a purely random sample of ems. current state of the art approaches typically enumerate ems with a certain objective or constraint; like the enumeration of the shortest pathways , the enumeration of pathways including a specific target reaction , enumeration based on available measurements , enumeration of all possible pathways through selected reactions that satisfy the steady-state flux of the entire network (elementary flux patterns) , or decomposition of the network in modules . these approaches do not represent the full solution space and hence a number of potentially interesting solutions may be missed. one of the key requirements for successful understanding of the cellular metabolism based on ems is the ability to enumerate a representative subset of modes. in this work, we develop a method for generating random samples of ems without computing theiras more data are collected, metabolic models keep constantly growing in size. this increases the challenge for em-based analysis of metabolic networks, as the number of ems grows exponentially with the network size. for that matter, the development of em sampling approaches will become increasingly important. this work is a contribution in that direction. we developed a method that prevents the combinatorial explosion of the number of ems during computation, by adding a filtering step that randomly samples among the candidate modes at each iteration. unlike other methods for obtaining reduced sets of ems , our approach does not use any objective functions or experimental flux constraints. efmevolver is the approach most similar to ours. it samples the ems that contain a target reaction, rather than the whole solution space. it uses linear programming (lp) to find a single em, and a genetic algorithm (ga) to search different solutions. it has the advantage that the procedure can be stopped after a desired number of modes have been collected, whereas our approach only yields valid ems after completion. on the downside, it requires tuning the parameters for the ga and selection of a proper fitness function, whereas or method is tunable by a single parameter. our method can show a bias towards smaller em pathway lengths if the selection probability is too low. given its formulation, it is likely that efmevolver exhibits the same bias, although it is not evaluated how strong that bias can be. despite the current shortcomings, em sampling is a promising approach for computation of ems at the genome-scale, and opens the possibility for application of em-based metabolic engineering methods for optimizing metabolic networks at this scale. funding: research supported by the portuguese foundation for science and technology (fct), through the projects bridging systems and synthetic biology for the development of improved microbial cell factories (mit-pt/bs-bb/0082/2008) and synbiobacther-synthetic biology approaches to engineer therapeutic bacteria (ptdc/ebb-bio/102863/2008).
