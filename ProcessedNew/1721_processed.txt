sequence analysis extra-binomial variation approach for analysis of pooled dna sequencing data motivation: the invention of next-generation sequencing technology has made it possible to study the rare variants that are more likely to pinpoint causal disease genes. to make such experiments financially viable, dna samples from several subjects are often pooled before sequencing. this induces large between-pool variation which, together with other sources of experimental error, creates over-dispersed data. statistical analysis of pooled sequencing data needs to appropriately model this additional variance to avoid inflating the false-positive rate. results: we propose a new statistical method based on an extra-binomial model to address the over-dispersion and apply it to pooled case-control data. we demonstrate that our model provides a better fit to the data than either a standard binomial model or a traditional extra-binomial model proposed by williams and can analyse both rare and common variants with lower or more variable pool depths compared to the other methods. availability: package extrabinomial is on http://cran.r-project.org/to date, numerous common genetic variants associated with common disease [e.g. type 1 diabetes (t1d)] have been successfully discovered by genome-wide association studies . however, linkage disequilibrium (ld) means these results may only be used to identify an associated region, which usually encompasses several genes. to pinpoint the exact causal genes, under the assumption that there may be multiple variants of common and low frequency which alter disease risk, attention has turned to low-frequency variants that are unlikely to be in ld with other variants. associated low-frequency variants are considered more likely to be causal. for example, several independent rare risk variants with implied functional roles were recently associated with inflammatory bowel disease using next-generation sequencing of pooled samples , a design similar to that ofwho undertook the first such study and whose data we re-examine here.re-sequenced 144 target regions covering exons and splice sites of 10 t1d candidate genes that were previously found to be associated with t1d or related diseases. the study used 454 sequencing of 20 pools of dna from 480 patients and 480 healthy controls (48 samples per pool). four rare variants, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) located in the interferon induced with helicase c domain 1 (ifih1) and the c-type lectin domain family 16, member a (clec16a) genes, displayed different frequencies in cases and controls according to fishers exact test, and evidence for association of two of these variants within the gene ifih1 was replicated in independent samples. this directly implicates ifih1 as causal in t1d. a major concern with this study is that huge variation exists between pool depths and the variation is especially large for rare snps . the variation is derived from both the pooling and the sequencing, and this is not accounted for by fishers exact test which assumes a binomial variance within pools and neglects between-pool variation. the poisson model has also been employed for sequence count data as well as analysis of differential gene expression . with only one parameter, the poisson distribution assumes the variance of reads is equal to its mean. however, the variance may exceed the mean, requiring an over-dispersed model as in our data. a negative binomial model has been used as an alternative to model the larger variance, for example in testing differential expression for digital gene expression data , given it has one more parameter than the poisson distribution. the addition of this parameter, however, means the negative binomial model requires a large number of replicates to estimate the two parameters properly. another fully mathematically specified over-dispersed model is the beta-binomial model, which, applied to variants derived from pooled case-control sequence data, would assume a binomial distribution within pools and that the expected allele frequency of each pool is beta-distributed.used this model and calculated maximized log-likelihoods to analyse the effects from seeds and extracts on germination. other applications of this model include the analysis of false discovery rates (fdrs) in microarray data to model the number of false rejections, yielding a less biased fdr estimator than the empirical estimator following a binomial distribution . the advantage of to whom correspondence should be addressed.

meaningful parameters and a computable likelihood which could be maximized by standard methods to calculate the relating parameters. however, maximizing a beta-binomial likelihood can be computationally difficult. an alternative is to use a model in which only the first two moments are defined. we propose to use and extend such an extra-binomial model originally described by williams (1982). the extra-binomial model still assumes the allele counts obey a binomial distribution within pools and also takes the between-pool variance into consideration. in this article, we compare the performance of statistical tests assuming simple binomial variation, williams extra-binomial variation and our modified extra-binomial model using quantilequantile (qq) plots. we also extend our study
