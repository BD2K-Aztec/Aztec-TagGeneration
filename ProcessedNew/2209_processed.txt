sequence analysis hitc: exploration of high-throughput 'c' experiments the r/bioconductor package hitc facilitates the exploration of high-throughput 3c-based data. it allows users to import and export c data, to transform, normalize, annotate and visualize interaction maps. the package operates within the bioconductor framework and thus offers new opportunities for future development in this field. availability and implementation: the r package hitc is available from the bioconductor website. a detailed vignette provides additional documentation and help for using the package.the three-dimensional organization of chromosomes and the physical interactions occurring along and between them play an important role in the regulation of gene activity. over the past 10 years, the development of chromosome conformation capture (3c)-based techniques has changed our view of nuclear organization . with the emergence of next-generation sequencing, high-throughput conformation capture techniques, such as circular 3c (4c;), 3c carbon-copy (5c;) or more recently hi-c , have been developed to study the physical interactions between many loci in parallel. while the use of high-throughput c techniques is expected to increase in coming years , bioinformatic methods and software to analyze such data are still lacking. here, we present the r/bioconductor package hitc that enables users to visualize and explore high-throughput c data. one advantage of the hitc package is that it operates within the open source bioconductor framework and thus offers new opportunities for future developments in this field. the hitc package is aimed at biologists interested in investigating their data and at biostatisticians involved in the development of new statistical methods which can be applied to c data.
