biopartsdb: a synthetic biology workflow web-application for education and research synthetic biology has become a widely used technology, and expanding applications in research, education and industry require progress tracking for team-based dna synthesis projects. although some vendors are beginning to supply multi-kilobase sequence-verified constructs, synthesis workflows starting with short oligos remain important for cost savings and pedagogical benefit. we developed biopartsdb as an open source, extendable workflow management system for synthetic biology projects with entry points for oligos and larger dna constructs and ending with sequence-verified clones.synthetic biology projects require software systems to organize, track and verify the creation of parts encoded by dna sequences, with individual parts corresponding to genomic elements such as promoters or coding domains. part sizes can range from 100 nucleotide regulatory elements to megabase chromosomes. tasks include organizing an experimental plan, tracking protocols, retaining quality control assessments, assessing performance and storing a verified part in a repository. biological enthusiasts, such as diy bio (http://diybio.org), educational initiatives such as igem (https://www.igem.org), and new synthetic biology courses such as build-a-genome all require workflow systems to match to dna synthesis protocols. protocols depend on whether a dna construct or part is obtained by pcr amplification, restriction digest or direct synthesis, and direct synthesis can involve different hierarchical assembly strategies. quality control procedures and parts storage, whether in a vector or as dna, can also depend on the synthetic route. while laboratory information management systems (lims) are available for synthetic biology , they focus primarily on synthetic dna inventory management rather than on the synthesis process itself. we therefore designed biopartsdb as an open source, modular tool for dna synthesis workflow and parts registration, providing a ready resource for research and education. our permissive license makes the software fully available for industrial and commercial applications as well.
