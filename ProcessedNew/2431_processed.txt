systems biology inference of gene regulatory networks from genome-wide knockout fitness data motivation: genome-wide fitness is an emerging type of high-throughput biological data generated for individual organisms by creating libraries of knockouts, subjecting them to broad ranges of environmental conditions, and measuring the resulting clone-specific fitnesses. since fitness is an organism-scale measure of gene regulatory network behaviour, it may offer certain advantages when insights into such phenotypical and functional features are of primary interest over individual gene expression. previous works have shown that genome-wide fitness data can be used to uncover novel gene regulatory interactions, when compared with results of more conventional gene expression analysis. yet, to date, few algorithms have been proposed for systematically using genome-wide mutant fitness data for gene regulatory network inference. results: in this article, we describe a model and propose an inference algorithm for using fitness data from knockout libraries to identify underlying gene regulatory networks. unlike most prior methods, the presented approach captures not only structural, but also dynamical and non-linear nature of biomolecular systems involved. a state space model with non-linear basis is used for dynamically describing gene regulatory networks. network structure is then elucidated by estimating unknown model parameters. unscented kalman filter is used to cope with the non-linearities introduced in the model, which also enables the algorithm to run in on-line mode for practical use. here, we demonstrate that the algorithm provides satisfying results for both synthetic data as well as empirical measurements of gal network in yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and tyrrliur network in bacteria shewanella oneidensis. availability: matlab code and datasets are available to download atin recent years, modelling and inference of biological regulatory networks have become an active area of research in large part owing to the emergence of microarray technology, which allows for simultaneous measurement of gene expression on the genome-wide scale . the vast amounts of data provided by gene expression microarrays enable the possibility of accurate estimation of gene regulatory network organization, which has greatly benefited a broad range of disciplinesfrom basic biological sciences, to bioengineering, to medical diagnosis and treatment . the goal of inference algorithms is to discover the connectivity structure and, potentially, dynamic characteristics of these networks based on such time-or other state-series data. among other things, the nature of inference algorithms varies depending on the types of biological networks and the way they are modelled (;). one category of models quantizes the empirical data into binary numbers and views network structures as boolean constraints . although this could be attempted in a deterministic framework, both the uncertainties introduced by measurement errors as well as the inherent stochasticity of gene expression make any experimental data substantially probabilistic. to impart this random nature to the boolean framework, the probability boolean network models have been introduced . however, as biological processes are neither digital nor homogeneous, further gene regulatory modelling and inference refinements may be achieved by using alternative probabilistic network descriptions , continuous-time differential equations , stochastic differential equations , and control theory methods , among others. although any of these methods offers certain advantages and disadvantages in attempting to capture the structure and dynamics of gene regulatory network, it should be noted that they have largely been designed toward describing gene expression data. recently, however, a new type of high-throughput data has emerged and seen rapid proliferation in empirical biosciencesthe genome-wide fitness data. at its core, this involves to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2012. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article

by generating knockout/knockdown mutant strain libraries for all non-essential genes in an organism . these libraries are then further subjected to a large number of environmental conditions and stresseswith the observable in each of the settings being the fitness of individual clones (collected in stationary phase). pairing the resulting data with an appropriate model of gene expression then allows for the inference of the underlying gene regulatory networks through estimation of significant interaction terms, along with those for production, degradation, expression level, etc. although potentially applicable to any observable type, this approach may be particularly well-suited for the use with fitness data to help constrain any inferred gene regulatory network solutions to those dynamic modes that are most important for a given set of biological functions and conditionse.g. growth on specific substrates or tolerance to certain stresses. recent works have indeed suggested that the use of genome-wide fitness data can provide new perspectives on systems-level organization of cells and uncover novel gene regulatory interactions when compared with gene expression-based analysis ;). yet, although on a limited scale the idea of biological network characterization based on knockout data has been considered before, e.g., the emergence of high-throughput genome-wide gene deletion/interruption technology along with the use of population fitness rather than gene expression as an observable offers novel challenges as well as benefits to the task of gene network inference. on the one hand, microarray and other gene expression experiments typically generate high-dimensional data in the form of a real vector that comprises expression levels of multiple genes at each sampled time and/or condition point, whereas fitness measurements map the state of the system into a much lower dimensional spacee.g. that of a single real variable, such as growth rate. this inevitably leads to significant loss of information. on the other hand, deletion experiments usually involve simply cultivating and observing cells, which could be performed on a substantially larger scale, much more efficiently and under significantly greater range of conditions when compared with the relatively demanding gene expression assays. the ensuing ability to perform experiments simultaneously across the entire mutant collection substantially increases the overall genome-wide fitness data dimensionalityoften putting it on par with available gene expression datasets. furthermore, fitness observations allow for the preferential selection or overweighting of clones that display a desirable phenotype, e.g. the stronger the selectionthe more significant the contribution of surviving strains. this becomes an increasingly important factor in many biotechnological and biomedical applications, whereby the contribution of practically irrelevant genes is effectively being filtered outregardless of their statistical significance or dynamic state. indeed, it has been shown that this type of data is very useful for the determination of target gene functions . few systematic models and/or inference algorithms have been proposed for the elucidation of regulatory networks from fitness data. conclusions are often being made on the basis of visual inspections or similar relatively naive strategies. yet, greater prominence and availability of such data along with indications that fitness profiling might contain information about gene regulation suggest the need for a more comprehensive and rigorous inference approach. the analysis of ample data provided by genome-wide fitness experiments may also be useful in complementing network inference methods based on microarray gene expression and such other data by helping to initialize them or further refine their results. in this work, we propose an algorithm for inferring gene regulatory networks from genome-wide knockout fitness data. our approach is based on describing biological networks via a non-linear dynamical model and then elucidating model parameters from fitness measurements. the resulting parameter set can be used to identify the underlying regulatory network structure as well as to make forward-looking estimates of its function under temporal dynamics or environmental changes. in section 2, we describe the system model and problem formulation. in section 2.2, we provide a heuristic sample ordering selection algorithm based on correlation score to cope with the order selection problem that arises when using mutant fitness data. in section 3, we describe the parameter estimation algorithm based on the unscented kalman filter (ukf) technique. in section 4, we use the proposed algorithm to analyse both a synthetic example as well as experimental data from yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and bacteria shewanella oneidensis, which are further compared against known empirical results. we conclude the article with a summary and remarks regarding the proposed model and inference algorithm.we have proposed a dynamical model and an algorithm for inference of gene regulatory networks based on genome-wide knockout fitness dataan emerging data type, whose utility in biological systems identification has not been sufficiently explored to date. the algorithm uses a statespace model to capture the dynamical and non-linear nature of such networks. an unscented kalman filter is used to infer the unknown parameters in order to cope with model non-linearity.although fitness data inherently suffers from loss of information caused by its reduced dimensionality, when compared with the more widely explored gene expression data type, the potentially larger amounts of and more contextually/phenotypically meaningful data provided may be able to compensate for the relative lack of resolution as our work appears to suggest. the analysis of a synthetic example as well as empirical gal and tyrrliur network data presented here shows that the described algorithm is able to provide satisfying inference results even for relatively complex mechanisms. ultimately, the two data typesgene expression and knockout fitnessmay be expected to be most informative when used in a complementary fashion. as noted previously, inferences generated from genome-wide knockout fitness data could be used to facilitate network elucidation methods based on gene expression by helping initialize or further refine their predictions. conversely, information provided by gene expression data may be exploited by the proposed algorithm in conjunction with knockout fitness data to synergistically improve final inference results. for instance, gene expression data may be collected under a more limited set of conditions, for a subset of the mutant library, or just for the wild-type strain; and used for the initial inference of an augmented state vector yk g t k, a t , b t , i t , t t associated only with the gene expression part of the model, equations (1)(4). such preliminary results could then be used as a prior for the subsequent network inference round, which uses genome-wide fitness data in order to take advantage of its potentially larger scale or more immediate availability across a range of conditions, as well as to introduce corresponding phenotypically significant refinements (as discussed earlier). several other directions appear promising toward potentially further extending and improving the inference methodology proposed here. for instance, the non-linear univariate interaction model, equation (2), may be augmented with explicitly multivariate terms. this should serve to enhance resolution of non-linear interactions for a given gene across multiple reaction partners and improve modelling accuracy, though at a cost of substantial computational overhead owing to complications related to multiplicative noise propagation and the need to account for intermediate molecular complexes. perhaps a more straightforward approach involves using the model to accommodate multiple-knockout experiments (i.e. those involving multiple inactivated genes in each strain). this is done analogously to the way single-knockout networks have been analyzed here by simply setting all of the corresponding interaction term coefficients to zero for the genes in question. the reason we have focused less on such applications in this work, however, is the present scarcity of multiple-versus single-knockout observation data. finally, additional constraints could be incorporated to help account for other pre-existing sources of experimental or heuristic information. for example, we have noted earlier the possibility of applying feed optimization schemes to condition data ordering. one may further look at various sparseness conditions as a way of improving computational efficiency and incorporating pre-existing knowledge about the network during inference. [though, care should be taken, as significant variations in effective regulatory network topology may naturally arise across experimental conditions or in going from one related organism to another (] overall, we believe that these questions help further support the suggestion that the analysis of genome-wide fitness data (whether directly or in conjunction with gene expression data) towards understanding of biological systems function and, in particular, inference of gene regulatory network organization offers a rich new area of future researchto which this article is seeking to make an initial contribution.
