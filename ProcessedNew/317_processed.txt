an efficient parallel algorithm for accelerating computational protein design motivation: structure-based computational protein design (scpr) is an important topic in protein engineering. under the assumption of a rigid backbone and a finite set of discrete conformations of side-chains, various methods have been proposed to address this problem. a popular method is to combine the dead-end elimination (dee) and a tree search algorithms, which provably finds the global minimum energy conformation (gmec) solution. results: in this article, we improve the efficiency of computing a heuristic functions for protein design and propose a variant of a algorithm in which the search process can be performed on a single gpu in a massively parallel fashion. in addition, we make some efforts to address the memory exceeding problem in a search. as a result, our enhancements can achieve a significant speedup of the a-based protein design algorithm by four orders of magnitude on large-scale test data through pre-computation and parallelization, while still maintaining an acceptable memory overhead. we also show that our parallel a search algorithm could be successfully combined with imindee, a state-of-the-art dee criterion, for rotamer pruning to further improve scpr with the consideration of continuous side-chain flexibility. availability: our software is available and distributed open-source under the gnu lesser general license version 2.1 (gnu, february 1999). the source code can be downloaded fromstructure-based computational protein design (scpr) provides a promising tool in a wide range of protein engineering applications, such as drug design , enzyme synthesis , drug resistance prediction and design of proteinprotein interactions . the basic idea of scpr is to find a new amino acid sequence based on a known structure, such that the total energy of the resulting molecular complex is minimized. in general, it is difficult to model an ideal protein design framework with the consideration of full backbone and side-chain flexibility, since there are usually a huge number of conformations that need to be sampled even for a small protein. therefore, in practice assumptions are often made to reduce the complexity of the protein design problem. in most of protein design models , the backbone structure is assumed as a rigid body, and only side-chains are allowed to rotate among a finite set of discrete conformations, called the rotamer library. under the rigid backbone assumption, the goal of scpr is to search over all possible combinations of side-chain rotamer conformations of different allowed amino acids, trying to find the global minimum energy conformation (aka gmec). unfortunately, this problem has been proven np-hard . thus, a number of heuristic methods, such as monte carlo and genetic algorithms, have been proposed to find the approximate solutions to this problem . a recent study also suggests that we can split the entire task into small pieces so that a large-scale protein design problem can be solved in parallel . however, these approaches cannot provide any provable guarantee of finding the global optimal solution (i.e., gmec) as they may get trapped in a local optimum. in contrast, provable algorithms, such as tree decomposition , integer linear programming with a branch-and-bound technique , dead-end elimination (dee;) and a search assure that gmec will be outputted as a final solution. in particular, the combination of dee and a search is popular in computational protein design . in this design strategy, dee is first applied to prune a large number of unfavorable rotamers that are provably not part of the optimal solution. next, the a algorithm is used to search over all possible combinations of the remaining rotamers and compute the gmec solution. a number of dee criteria have been proposed to improve the rotamer pruning and reduce the complexity of the rotamer conformation search space . although dee can prune most rotamer conformations in the problem space, the a algorithm still runs in exponential time in the worst case. in the dee and a-based framework, a is generally one of the most time-consuming parts, especially for large-scale protein design problems. thus it is vital to propose a faster algorithm to alleviate this bottleneck and therefore accelerate the protein design process. in this article, we develop an efficient parallel a tree search algorithm to accelerate computational protein design. by optimizing and parallelizing the computation of heuristic functions and the underlying data structure (i.e., the priority queue) for a search, our algorithm significantly speeds up the a search to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author

tests on a benchmark dataset of 74 proteins show that our new algorithm runs up to 20 000 times faster than the original a-based protein design algorithm, while still maintaining an acceptable amount of memory overhead. thus, our parallel a search algorithm can provide a practically useful tool for computational protein design.
