structural bioinformatics cell-dock: high-performance proteinâ€“protein docking the application of docking to large-scale experiments or the explicit treatment of protein flexibility are part of the new challenges in structural bioinformatics that will require large computer resources and more efficient algorithms. highly optimized fast fourier transform (fft) approaches are broadly used in docking programs but their optimal code implementation leaves hardware acceleration as the only option to significantly reduce the computational cost of these tools. in this work we present cell-dock, an fft-based docking algorithm adapted to the cell be processor. we show that cell-dock runs faster than ftdock with maximum speedups of above 200, while achieving results of similar quality. availability and implementation: the source code is released under gnu general public license version 2 and can be downloaded fromcell functions rely on intricate networks of proteinprotein interactions, which need to be understood at structural and functional level. given the magnitude of the human interactome, experimental efforts will have to be complemented by computational approaches such as proteinprotein docking, which aims to predict the structure of complexes from the free unbound subunits . fast fourier transform (fft)-based docking approaches revolutionized the field , but faster computer solutions are required in order to face some of the current docking challenges, some of which have arisen from the recent critical assessment of prediction of interactions (capri) experiments , such as protein flexibility , large-scale experiments or multi-protein docking . given that fft implementations are highly optimized, it is not likely to speed up this type of calculations by using only algorithm optimization techniques, leaving hardware acceleration as the most feasible option to significantly reduce the computational cost of these tools (;). in this work we present cell-dock, to our knowledge the first protein docking algorithm implemented on the cell be processor .cell-dock is a new fft-based docking implementation for the cell be architecture, showing similar prediction rates to ftdock, with much more efficient performance. this implementation can efficiently run on the widely accessible playstation 3, opening the door to large-scale experiments that may benefit
