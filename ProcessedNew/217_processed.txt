aliview: a fast and lightweight alignment viewer and editor for large datasets aliview is an alignment viewer and editor designed to meet the requirements of next-generation sequencing era phylogenetic datasets. aliview handles alignments of unlimited size in the formats most commonly used, i.e. fasta, phylip, nexus, clustal and msf. the intuitive graphical interface makes it easy to inspect, sort, delete, merge and realign sequences as part of the manual filtering process of large datasets. aliview also works as an easy-to-use alignment editor for small as well as large datasets. availability and implementation: aliview is released as open-source software under the gnu general public license, version 3.0 (gplv3), and is available at github (www.github.com/aliview). the program is cross-platform and extensively tested on linux, mac os x and windows systems. downloads and help are available atas dna and protein datasets are getting larger, the demand for a refined and fast alignment editor increases. the need for an improved alignment editor and viewer, therefore, emerged in the 1000 plants project (1kp, www.onekp.com) while designing degenerate primers for a diverse set of ferns from transcriptome data . what was lacking in the previous available programs was the combination of abilities to (i) get an overview of large nucleotide alignments, (ii) visually highlight various conserved regions, (iii) have a simple and intuitive way to align, rearrange, delete and merge sequences and (iv) find degenerate primers in selected semiconserved regions. although some of these features are individually present in current alignment editors, the combination is not. in addition to the core functionality meeting these specific needs, aliview is designed with a complete set of intuitive general functions meeting the most common demands for preparing a multiple sequence alignment. here, aliview is introduced as an alignment viewer and editor with a unique combination of features that allows the user to work with large datasets. the intuitive user interface provides easy visual overview and navigation and works with unlimited size alignments.
