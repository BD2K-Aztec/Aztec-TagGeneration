systems biology nail, a software toolset for inferring, analyzing and visualizing regulatory networks the wide variety of published approaches for the problem of regulatory network inference makes using multiple inference algorithms complex and time-consuming. network analysis and inference library (nail) is a set of software tools to simplify the range of computational activities involved in regulatory network inference. it uses a modular approach to connect different network inference algorithms to the same visualization and network-based analyses. nail is technology-independent and includes an interface layer to allow easy integration of components into other applications. availability and implementation: nail is implemented in matlab, runs on windows, linux and osx, and is available from sourceforge at https://sourceforge.net/projects/nailsystemsbiology/ for all researchers to use.modelling biological systems as networks (graphs) is becoming a common approach in the life sciences. specifically, inferring regulatory networks from genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data is now giving insight into how biological systems function in healthy and pathological states . in a clinical context, network medicine is becoming increasingly important in developing treatments for complex multifactorial conditions .
