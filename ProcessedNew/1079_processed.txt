compendiumdb: an r package for retrieval and storage of functional genomics data currently, the gene expression omnibus (geo) contains public data of over 1 million samples from more than 40 000 microarray-based functional genomics experiments. this provides a rich source of information for novel biological discoveries. however, unlocking this potential often requires retrieving and storing a large number of expression profiles from a wide range of different studies and platforms. the compendiumdb r package provides an environment for down-loading functional genomics data from geo, parsing the information into a local or remote database and interacting with the database using dedicated r functions, thus enabling seamless integration with other tools available in r/bioconductor. availability and implementation: the compendiumdb package is written in r, mysql and perl. source code and binaries are available from cran (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/compen diumdb/) for all major platforms (linux, ms windows and os x) under the gplv3 license.public repositories such as the gene expression omnibus (geo) and arrayexpress provide a large amount of functional genomics data from a wide range of studies performed in different organisms and on different (microarray) platforms. however, retrieving and systematically storing these datasets to extract novel biological information is often challenging. several tools and web-based resources have been developed (expression data, sample and probe annotation to the relational database and (iii) convert experimental data from the database to an r/bioconductor expressionset.
