mesord 1.0: stochastic reaction-diffusion simulations in the microscopic limit mesord is a tool for simulating stochastic reaction-diffusion systems as modeled by the reaction diffusion master equation. the simulated systems are defined in the systems biology markup language with additions to define compartment geometries. mesord 1.0 supports scale-dependent reaction rate constants and reactions between reactants in neighbouring subvolumes. these new features make it possible to construct physically consistent models of diffusion-controlled reactions also at fine spatial discretization. availability: mesord is written in c and licensed under the gnu general public license (gpl). mesord can be downloaded at http:// mesord.sourceforge.net. the mesord homepage, http://mesord. sourceforge.net, contains detailed documentation and news about recently implemented features.physical modelling is increasingly important to gain insights about how biochemical processes work in living cells. different processes do, however, need to be modeled at different levels of detail. it may, for example, be important to consider that chemical reactions are stochastic, spatially dependent or both. the combined spatial stochastic models are, for example, needed when there are slow local fluctuations that influences the rates of chemical reactions in a non-linear way or when association dissociation events are interrupted by additional reaction before the reactants have reached uncorrelated positions (mahmutovic et al., submitted for publication). in these cases, it is desirable to have a tool that can evolve a biochemical process at different levels of detail in a physically consistent manner. at the finest level of detail, stochastic reaction diffusion kinetics can be consistently modeled using the spatially and temporally continuous framework developed by) for reactive spheres and later extended to finite association rates and dissociation . it is, however, often neither necessary nor practical to model reactions at this level of detail. by discretizing space into subvolumes and keeping track of the number of molecules of each species in each subvolume and when they react, the process is described as a continuous-time discrete-state markov process. the master equation that governs this process is known as the reaction diffusion master equation (rdme) . the rdme has recently been shown to diverge and give unphysical solutions at high spatial resolution . the divergence problem was solved by introducing scale-dependent bi-molecular reaction rate constants where the new mesoscopic rate constants are calculated from the microscopic framework . here we describe recent developments of mesord , a tool for stochastic reaction-diffusion simulations or more specifically a tool for simulating trajectories corresponding to the rdme. how different tools (; van zon and ten) for stochastic reaction diffusion modeling compares with each other in terms of capabilities has been discussed elsewhere . the main enhancement compared with previous mesord versions and other rdme-based simulators is the use of scale-dependent mesoscopic reaction rate constants , which allows for microscopically consistent simulations at fine spatial discretization. scale-dependent rate constants also make it possible to simulate rdme models on planar 2d surfaces (membranes), where the problems of diffusion-controlled reactions are much more severe than in 3d because reactants do not lose spatial correlations even at large distances . since our previous applications note we have also added functionalities for defining cellular compartment geometries using triangle meshes in addition to the previously available method based on constructive solid geometries (csg) and also included the possibility of running mean-field simulations within mesord.
