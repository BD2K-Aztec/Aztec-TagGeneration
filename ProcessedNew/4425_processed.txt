gene expression statistical significance of variables driving systematic variation in high-dimensional data motivation: there are a number of well-established methods such as principal component analysis (pca) for automatically capturing systematic variation due to latent variables in large-scale genomic data. pca and related methods may directly provide a quantitative characterization of a complex biological variable that is otherwise difficult to precisely define or model. an unsolved problem in this context is how to systematically identify the genomic variables that are drivers of systematic variation captured by pca. principal components (pcs) (and other estimates of systematic variation) are directly constructed from the genomic variables themselves, making measures of statistical significance artificially inflated when using conventional methods due to over-fitting. results: we introduce a new approach called the jackstraw that allows one to accurately identify genomic variables that are statistically significantly associated with any subset or linear combination of pcs. the proposed method can greatly simplify complex significance testing problems encountered in genomics and can be used to identify the genomic variables significantly associated with latent variables. using simulation, we demonstrate that our method attains accurate measures of statistical significance over a range of relevant scenarios. we consider yeast cell-cycle gene expression data, and show that the proposed method can be used to straightforwardly identify genes that are cell-cycle regulated with an accurate measure of statistical significance. we also analyze gene expression data from post-trauma patients, allowing the gene expression data to provide a molecularly driven phenotype. using our method, we find a greater enrichment for inflammatory-related gene sets compared to the original analysis that uses a clinically defined, although likely imprecise, phenotype. the proposed method provides a useful bridge between large-scale quan-tifications of systematic variation and gene-level significance analyses. availability and implementation: an r software package, calledlatent variable models play an important role in understanding variation in genomic data . they are particularly useful for characterizing systematic variation in genomic data whose variable representation is unobserved or imprecisely known . principal component analysis (pca) has proven to be an especially informative method for capturing quantitative signatures of latent variables in genomic data, and it is in widespread use across a range of applications. for example, pca has been successfully applied to uncover the systematic variation in gene expression , estimate structure in population genetics , and account for dependence in multiple hypothesis testing . generally, principal components (pcs) can be thought of as estimates of unobserved manifestation of latent variables; they are constructed by aggregating variation across thousands or more genomic variables . what is missing from this highly successful system is a method to precisely identify which genomic variables are the statistically significant drivers of the pcs in genomic data, which in turn identifies the genomic variables associated with the unobserved latent variables. in a typical application of pca to genomic data, all variables will have non-zero loadings, meaning that they all make some contribution to the construction of pcs. we refer to genomic variables as the high-dimensional variables considered in a genomics study such as genes, array probe sets, or genetic loci. in some cases, when many (or most) of these contributions are forcibly set to zero, similar pcs nevertheless emerge. methods have been proposed to induce sparsity in the loadings, for example, with a lasso penalized pca or a bayesian prior . methods have also been developed to consider uncertainty in pca expansions . various formulations of statistical significance have been considered previously in the context of pca. these have usually been focused on scenarios where the number of observations is substantially larger than the number of variables, significance is measured in terms of a completely unstructured data matrix where all variables are mutually independent, or the goal is to only determine the number of significant pcs . the problem we consider here differs from those scenarios. our goal is not a minimal representation of a pca; we would like instead to develop a strategy that accurately identifies which genomic variables are truly associated with systematic variation of interest. this can be phrased in statistical terminology as developing a significance test for associations between genomic to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the

the genomic variables associated with pcs of interest, as well as subsets and rotations of pcs of interest. our approach is capable of obtaining the empirical null distribution of association statistics (e.g. f-statistics) and applying these to the observed association statistics between genomic features and pcs to obtain valid statistical significance measures. succinctly, new pcs are computed from a dataset with a few independently permuted variables, which become tractable synthetic null variables. the association statistics between newly computed pcs and synthetic null variables serve as empirical null statistics, accounting for the measurement error and over-fitting of pca. as an application, we consider the problem of identifying genes whose expression is cell-cycle regulated. in this case, there are infinitely many theoretical curves that would represent cell-cycle regulation to the point where a standard statistical analysis involves an unwieldy composite null hypothesis . we identify the few realized patterns of cellcycle regulated gene expression through pca and we are able to directly test whether each gene is associated with these using the proposed approach. as another application, we analyzed observational gene expression profiles of blunt-force trauma patients , whose post-trauma inflammatory responses are difficult to be quantified using conventional means. when the clinical phenotype of interest cannot be precisely measured and modeled, we may estimate it directly from genomic data itself. we identify genes driving systematic variation in gene expression of post-trauma patients and demonstrate that our analysis is biologically richer than the original analysis . pca has direct connections to independent component analysis (ica;) and k-means clustering . therefore, the methods we propose are likely applicable to those models as well. furthermore, this approach has potential generalizations to a much broader class of clustering and latent variable methods that all seek to capture systematic variation.we evaluated the proposed method on simulated data so that we could directly assess its accuracy, and we also applied the method to two genomic datasets to demonstrate its utility in practice.we have developed a method to accurately carry out statistical significance tests of associations between high-dimensional variables and latent variables, which have been estimated through systematic variation present in the observed high-dimensional variables themselves. our approach is to maintain the overall systematic variation in the high-dimensional dataset, while replacing a small number of observed variables with independently permuted synthetic null variables. these synthetic null variables allow us to estimate the null distribution of the association statistics calculated on the original data that takes into account the inherent over-fitting that occurs when estimating latent variables through methods such as pca. we call this approach the jackstraw because it draws on the idea of the game of jackstraws, where a player must remove a stick (i.e. a variable) from a pile of tangled sticks without disturbing the overall structure. through extensive simulations, we demonstrated that the proposed method is capable of accounting for over-fitting and producing accurate statistical significance measures. we also demonstrated that applying conventional association testing methods to this problem artificially inflates the statistical significance of associations. an input required for the proposed method is the number of pcs, r, that capture systematic variation from latent variables. determining the number of statistically significant pcs is an active area of research, and defining a number of significantpcs depends on the data structure and the context (;). note that setting r to be too small leads to dependence in the residuals of model (2). this leads to the problems of dependence discussed in). subsets of pcs can be considered while conditioning on other pcs in the jackstraw framework (supplementary material), so it is possible to avoid setting r to be too small. for example, if one would like to identify variables associated with the top three pcs, but is unsure whether the given data has three or four significant pcs, we have found it more robust to input r=4, which will adjust for potential systematic residual variation captured by the fourth pc. we demonstrated our approach using pca. it is well known that individual pcs may not be directly interpretable or may contain multiple signals of interest that the user wishes to distinguish. the jackstraw method allows one to pinpoint a set of genomic variables associated with any given pc, a subset of pcs, a linear combination of two or more pcs, the projection of a subset of pcs onto an external variable, rotations of subsets of pcs, and low-dimensional latent variable estimates from other methods (see supplementary material). therefore, this approach can be used to investigate and identify biological signals that may manifest in a particular subspace spanned by the estimated latent variables. we do not advocate blindly applying our method to the top r pcs without considering these issues. since the proposed method allows one to rigorously identify subsets of genomic variables associated with pcs, it allows one to also investigate whether these subsets have any biological coherence. this may be useful in investigating whether a space spanned by a subset of pcs captures relevant biological signal or is merely reflecting technical artifacts (e.g. batch effects in gene expression data). the method also improves the surrogate variable analysis algorithm of) in that it allows a more precise determination of the control variables that are used to estimate the surrogate variables. thus, we have found the jackstraw to also be useful in the context of dealing with latent variables that reflect technical effects of no biological relevance. the proposed method represents a novel resampling approach operating on variables, whereas established resampling approaches, such as the jackknife and the bootstrap, tend to operate on observations . when applying these methods, systematic variation due to latent variables is intentionally perturbed, since their purpose is typically to assess the sampling variation of a single variable. in high-dimensional data, we may need to preserve systematic variation due to latent variables, which is the problem that the jackstraw addresses. by accurately testing for associations between observed highdimensional variables and the systematic manifestation of latent variables in the observed variables, our proposed method allows for the automatic discovery of complex sources of variation and the genomic variables that drive them. the proposed method extends pca and related methods beyond their popular applications in exploring, visualizing and characterizing the systematic variation to genomic variable level (e.g. gene-level) significance analyses. given the increasingly important role that nonparametric estimation of systematic variation plays in the analysis of genomic data , the proposed method may be useful in many areas of quantitative biology using high-throughput technologies as well as other areas of high-dimensional data analysis.
