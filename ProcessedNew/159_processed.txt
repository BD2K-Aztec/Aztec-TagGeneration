a general species delimitation method with applications to phylogenetic placements motivation: sequence-based methods to delimit species are central to dna taxonomy, microbial community surveys and dna metabar-coding studies. current approaches either rely on simple sequence similarity thresholds (otu-picking) or on complex and compute-intensive evolutionary models. the otu-picking methods scale well on large datasets, but the results are highly sensitive to the similarity threshold. coalescent-based species delimitation approaches often rely on bayesian statistics and markov chain monte carlo sampling, and can therefore only be applied to small datasets. results: we introduce the poisson tree processes (ptp) model to infer putative species boundaries on a given phylogenetic input tree. we also integrate ptp with our evolutionary placement algorithm (epa-ptp) to count the number of species in phylogenetic placements. we compare our approaches with popular otu-picking methods and the general mixed yule coalescent (gmyc) model. for de novo species delimitation, the stand-alone ptp model generally out-performs gymc as well as otu-picking methods when evolutionary distances between species are small. ptp neither requires an ultra-metric input tree nor a sequence similarity threshold as input. in the open reference species delimitation approach, epa-ptp yields more accurate results than de novo species delimitation methods. finally, epa-ptp scales on large datasets because it relies on the parallel implementations of the epa and raxml, thereby allowing to delimit species in high-throughput sequencing data. availability and implementation: the code is freely available at www. exelixis-lab.org/software.html.dna barcoding studies mostly rely on a single marker gene and are widely used for dna taxonomy . more recently, highthroughput sequencing of barcoding genes has been deployed to disentangle the structure of microbial communities and in metabarcoding biodiversity studies. a central analytical task in such studies is to classify molecular sequences into entities that correspond to species; this is commonly denoted as otu-picking in metagenomic studies . the main goals of such methods are to identify known species and delimit new species . numerous approaches exist for associating anonymous reads/ query sequences with known species, for instance, nearest-neighbor blast or the navenave bayesian classifier . these methods use sequence similarity to associate reads with taxonomic ranks. phylogeny-aware methods for identifying reads were introduced independently and simultaneously with the evolutionary placement algorithm (epa;) and pplacer . instead of sequence similarity, they use the phylogenetic signal in the reference and query sequences to attain higher classification accuracy. note that obtaining a taxonomic classification from phylogenetic placements represents a difficult task because phylogenies and taxonomies are frequently incongruent . placement methods are similar to closed-reference otupicking or taxonomy-dependent methods . their ability to associate query sequences with species depends on the completeness of the taxon sampling in the reference data . closed-reference or taxonomy-dependent methods generally lack the ability to delimit new species; consequently, they may underestimate the number of species and hence the diversity in the query sequences (see example in supplementary). to identify new species, taxonomy-independent methods or de novo otu-picking approaches are used to initially cluster sequences into so-called molecular operational taxonomic units (motus) . then, one can use a representative sequence from each motu cluster and assign a taxonomic rank via taxonomy-dependent methods. although taxonomic assignments may still be inaccurate due to incomplete reference data, coarse-grain biodiversity estimates can be accurate when motus are assigned to higher taxonomic ranks. de novo otu-picking usually relies on unsupervised machine learning methods that to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2013. published by oxford university

it is currently unclear how motus correspond to species . to delimit species using molecular sequences, we initially need to define our species concept. the phylogenetic species concept (psc) was initially introduced by eldredge and cracraft (1980) and subsequently refined by;;; and nixon and wheeler (1990). for a review of pscs definitions please refer to. in general, phylogenetic species are the smallest units for which phylogenetic relationships can be reliably inferred. the psc, in particular, from the genealogical point of view , states that species reside at the transition point between evolutionary relationships that are best represented phylogenetically and relationships that are best reflected by reticulating genealogical connections . there already exist several psc-based species delimitation approaches (e.g. see reviews in). the general mixed yule coalescent (gmyc) model for delimiting species on single genes is frequently used in empirical studies . the gmyc method models speciation (among-species branching events) via a pure birth process and within-species branching events as neutral coalescent processes. gmyc identifies the transition points between inter-and intra-species branching rates on a time-calibrated ultrametric tree by maximizing the likelihood score of the model. it assumes that all lineages leading from the root to the transition points are different species. gmyc has been shown to work well for comparatively small population sizes and low birth rates . one drawback of gmyc is that it depends on the accuracy of the ultrametric input tree. obtaining an ultrametric tree from a given phylogeny is a compute-intensive and potentially error-prone process. most state-of-the-art likelihood-based tree calibration methods such as beast or dppdiv rely on bayesian sampling using mcmc (markov chain monte carlo) methods. when delimiting species in phylogenetic placements, which requires calibrating thousands of trees, it is almost impossible to deploy these methods in an automated pipeline, given the difficulties to assess mcmc chain convergence, for instance. inspired by the psc, we introduce the ptp model that can delimit species using non-ultrametric phylogenies. ultrametricity is not required because we model speciation rate by directly using the number of substitutions. the psc implies that deploying phylogenetic reconstruction methods within a species is inappropriate. a hierarchical relationship can nonetheless be inferred for intra-species sequences using phylogenetic methods. however, we expect to observe significant (in the statistical sense) differences between the relationships reconstructed among and within species. these differences are reflected by branch lengths that represent the mean expected number of substitutions per site between two branching events. thus, our fundamental assumption is that the number of substitutions between species is significantly higher than the number of substitutions within species. in a sense, this is analogous to the gmyc approach that intends to identify significant changes in the pace of branching events on the tree. however, gmyc uses time to identify branching rate transition points, whereas, in contrast, ptp directly uses the number of substitutions. ptp is simple, fast and robust. thus, it can easily be integrated with the epa to calculate the number of species in a set of query sequences that have been placed into a specific branch of the reference phylogeny. we implemented an open reference species delimitation pipeline by integrating ptp with the epa to identify known and new species. initially, we assess the performance of gmyc and the ptp approach as general de novo species delimitation methods using real and simulated data. we then compare ptp and gmyc with two representative otu-picking methods uclust (edgar, 2010) and crop . uclust represents a fixed threshold otu-picking approach, whereas crop is a soft threshold method that attempts to detect sequence clusters using a gaussian mixture model. finally, we evaluate the performance of our open reference approach epa-ptp. for a fair comparison, we also integrated crop with the epa (epacrop).we introduced, implemented and made available a new model (ptp) for species delimitation that is mainly intended for delimiting species in single-locus molecular phylogenies. ptp can propose species boundaries that are consistent with the psc. an important advantage of our method is that it models speciation in terms of the number of substitutions. thereby, it circumvents the potentially error-prone and compute-intensive process of generating time-calibrated ultrametric trees, which are required as an input for gmyc. using real datasets, we show that delimitations inferred with ptp are comparable with delimitations obtained via gmyc. simulations suggest ptp outperforms gmyc. in addition, it is more straightforward to use because it only requires a standard phylogenetic tree as input and because it also is substantially faster. on the 673-taxon metabarcoding dataset (using a modern intel desktop processor), for instance, r8s requires 3 days to complete, whereas raxml in combination with ptp only requires a total of about 20 min to return a species delimitation. we also compared gmyc and ptp with two clustering algorithms: crop and uclust. from our point of view, the problem of species delimitation needs to incoporate data from various sources (e.g. sequences and trees) and also depends heavily on the species definition used. thus, gmyc and ptp yield comparable results on real data because they are based on the psc. in contrast, by their very definition, crop and uclust simply identify sequence clusters. the fact that there is a difference between sequence clusters and psc-based species delimitation is underpinned by our simulations. we simulate the data in accordance with the gmyc model that essentially adopts the psc. to demonstrate the impact of the b 0 parameter on clustering-based delimitation accuracy, we plotted the pairwise sequence distances within species and between directly adjacent species in the simulated tree, for b 0 : 5 and b 0 : 160 in supplementary figures s2 and s3 of the online supplement. lower b 0 values lead to larger evolutionary distances between species, that is, the so-called barcoding gap is present. increasing b 0 reduces the evolutionary distances between species and the barcoding gap disappears (see puillandre et al., 2012 for examples of this phenomenon on real data). therefore, our simulations show that clustering algorithms work on datasets with the barcoding gap because phylogenetic species are mostly consistent with sequence clusters in this case. however, clustering methods are prone to fail when the barcoding gap is not present because sequences cannot be told apart any more via sequence similarity alone. as we show, gmyc and ptp delimitation performance is more robust to the absence of barcoding gap. thus, when no prior information (barcoding gap presence) about the dataset is available and the goal is to delimit phylogenetic species, gmyc and ptp should be preferred.note: sanger data (the reference dataset) has a total of 547 motus. the indicates that the number is not available in the original publication. apart from the stand-alone ptp code, we also introduced the epa-ptp pipeline that combines the epa with ptp. the epa-ptp pipeline represents the first integrated approach for analyzing metagenomic data that combines the phylogenetic placement approach with an explicit statistical criterion for species delimitation. on a representative empirical dataset, our pipeline yields a substantially more accurate diversity estimate than traditional otu-picking methods. using simulated data, we show that, open reference-based approaches can improve delimitation accuracy compared with de novo approaches. more importantly, the epa-ptp pipeline allows for deploying a widely accepted species concept to metagenomic data, where millions of sequences need to be processed. epa-crop (with the default setting of 2000 mcmc generations) is approximately twice as fast as epa-ptp on the metabarcoding dataset. note that 2000 generations may not be sufficient, and that crop does not offer a built-in mcmc convergence assessment criterion. in the following, we discuss the current limitations of our approach. readers should keep in mind that entities delimited by ptp are putative species only. the phylogenetic trees inferred on single-gene molecular sequences are gene trees rather than species trees, albeit the hierarchical relationships above the species boundaries are expected to be mostly consistent with the species tree. however, the boundaries inferred by ptp are only approximate. additional data need to be integrated to further validate the delimitations, such as morphological characters and multigene sequence data within an integrative taxonomy framework . the putative species delimited by ptp, can, for instance, be used as initial hypothesis that can be further scrutinized with multilocus coalescent-based methods such as bp&p . bp&p requires prior knowledge of species boundaries, and it represents a validation method, rather than a delimitation method. owing to its computational complexity, bp&p can currently only handle up to 20 species. compared with otu-picking methods, ptp and epa-ptp require substantially more cpu time because of the phylogenetic calculations. although most otu-picking methods can run on an off-the-shelf desktop computer, the epa-ptp pipeline requires a multicore server for analyzing large metagenomic datasets. because ptp initiates the search for the maximum likelihood delimitation at the root of the input phylogeny, the tree has to be correctly rooted to obtain accurate estimates. also, ptp should be used with caution on datasets where the number of individuals sampled per species is unbalanced and where the over-sampled species exhibit small within-species variation (see supplementary tables s1 through 4). in such cases, the inferred phylogeny will comprise both, subtrees (comprising one species and many individuals) with a large number of extremely short branches, and subtrees (comprising one species but only few individuals) with short, but not extremely short branches. such unbalanced samples may require the introduction of a third parameter class of branches to accommodate (i) over-sampled within-species branches, (ii) within-species branches and (iii) among-species branches. otherwise, the species that are not over-sampled cannot be delimited properly, that is, each individual is likely to be identified as a separate species. hence, we either need a criterion for removing over-sampled sequences, or a criterion to decide when and how many additional classes of ptp ( parameters) need to be introduced. however, a major drawback of introducing additional ptp classes is that the delimitation search space becomes significantly larger. hence, finding the maximum likelihood delimitation or a best known delimitation represents a challenging task. thus, before extending the number of classes, we feel that more work on the design and performance of heuristic search strategies for species delimitation is required to better characterize and understand the problem. this also applies to the heuristics used in gmyc, given that the underlying optimization problems are similar.
