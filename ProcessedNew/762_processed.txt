databases and ontologies biologisticsâ€”diffusion coefficients for complete proteome of escherichia coli motivation: biologistics provides data for quantitative analysis of transport (diffusion) processes and their spatio-temporal correlations in cells. mobility of proteins is one of the few parameters necessary to describe reaction rates for gene regulation. although understanding of diffusion-limited biochemical reactions in vivo requires mobility data for the largest possible number of proteins in their native forms, currently , there is no database that would contain the complete information about the diffusion coefficients (dcs) of proteins in a given cell type. results: we demonstrate a method for the determination of in vivo dcs for any moleculeregardless of its molecular weight, size and structurein any type of cell. we exemplify the method with the database of in vivo dc for all proteins (4302 records) from the proteome of k12 strain of escherichia coli, together with examples of dc of amino acids, sugars, rna and dna. the database follows from the scale-dependent viscosity reference curve (sdvrc). construction of sdvrc for prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell requires $20 in vivo measurements using techniques such as fluorescence correlation spectro-scopy (fcs), fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (frap), nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) or particle tracking. the shape of the sdvrc would be different for each organism, but the mathematical form of the curve remains the same. the presented method has a high predictive power, as the measurements of dcs of several inert, properly chosen probes in a single cell type allows to determine the dcs of thousands of proteins. additionally, obtained mobility data allow quantitative study of biochemical interactions in vivo.biologistics and biochemistry in a crowded environment are two emerging interdisciplinary fields of science. they provide quantitative analysis of transport of proteins and their spatio-temporal correlations involved in gene expression and regulation. according to the current state-of-the-art theory of gene expression (activation or repression) in bacteria , mobility of proteins is one of the few parameters necessary to describe reaction rates of gene regulation. the mobility is understood as a three-dimensional diffusion or one-dimensional sliding along dna (for prokaryotes and eukaryotes), or by velocity of molecular motors (in eukaryotic cells). understanding of diffusion-limited biochemical reactions requires accurate in vivo mobility data for the largest possible number of proteins in their native forms. the three-dimensional diffusion of different types of macromolecules in the cytoplasm of escherichia coli has been experimentally studied in several cases , but experimental determination of the mobility of all proteins is technically an impossible task because of their large number in a given cell. for example, the proteome of the k12 strain of e. coli contains more than 4300 proteins. moreover, most of the recent studies concern measurements mainly performed with the use of green fluorescent protein (gfp) or gfp fusion proteins . attempts to study the diffusion of many proteins simultaneously, under conditions resembling the interior of the cells, were performed in silico by mcguffee and elcock (2010). computational methods, however, have limitations arising from the speed and capacity of computing hardware and small number of interacting proteins in the system ($50 different types of proteins) . an alternative approach is the quantitative analysis of available literature data. mika and poolman (2011) gathered literature data of diffusion coefficients (dcs) of $20 different types of proteins in e. coli and proposed a power law dependence of the dc on the molecular weight of proteins. this power law, however , can be applied only for the proteins in a narrow range of molecular weights, i.e. between 20 and 30 kda. in this work, we present a method for predictions of the dcs of proteins for the proteome of any cell. we collected all available literature data on diffusion of various probes, including small molecules (water, glucose), proteins and plasmids, in the cytoplasm of e. coli. we used those data and the scaling function of viscosity (to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2012.

the method (40 for proteins), the experimentally measured dcs coincide remarkably well with the predicted dcs (cf.). therefore, measurements of dcs of several inert probes in a single cell type allow to determine the dcs of thousands of proteins and other (macro)molecules. correctly designed experiment would require involvement of different experimental techniques (nmr, frap, fcs, particle tracking) and the use of probes in a wide range of sizes.one needs to know the dc of a given probe in water and/or the hydrodynamic radius of this probe. additionally for the same probe, measurements of diffusion in cytoplasm of the cell should be performed. sizes of selected probes should be uniformly distributed along the logarithmic scale of sizes. we showed that only 20 measurements are required to predict the cytoplasmic dc of the typical protein with 20 accuracy. analysis of the sdvrc allows to determine the characteristic length scales r h and , and the dc of any (macro)molecule in the cytoplasm. for the cytoplasm of e. coli, we found that r h is surprisingly well correlated with the average radius of the dna loops forming the nucleoid. this suggests that the nucloeid is the main crowding agent (responsible for the macroscopic viscosity) in the cytoplasm of e. coli. finally, it should be noted that there are no additional requirements (except experimental data) to construct analogous database of dcs in other systems such as the nucleus or mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. we also believe that sdvrc can be easily adopted to calculate other types of mobility, including one-dimensional sliding, velocity of molecular motors, etc., as they all are inversely proportional to the viscosity.
