d-tailor: automated analysis and design of dna sequences motivation: current advances in dna synthesis, cloning and sequen-cing technologies afford high-throughput implementation of artificial sequences into living cells. however, flexible computational tools for multi-objective sequence design are lacking, limiting the potential of these technologies. results: we developed dna-tailor (d-tailor), a fully extendable software framework, for property-based design of synthetic dna sequences. d-tailor permits the seamless integration of multiple sequence analysis tools into a generic monte carlo simulation that evolves sequences toward any combination of rationally defined properties. as proof of principle, we show that d-tailor is capable of designing sequence libraries comprising all possible combinations among three different sequence properties influencing translation efficiency in escherichia coli. the capacity to design artificial sequences that systematically sample any given parameter space should support the implementation of more rigorous experimental designs. availability: source code is available for download at https://source forge.net/projects/dtailor/the accumulation of genomic data has fueled the development of numerous computational tools that infer functional behavior from biological sequences. these algorithms essentially capture our understanding of how functional information is encoded in nucleic acid and protein sequences. as a result, molecular biologists can now access a plethora of sequence analysis tools to help them predict functional behaviors from plain sequences . common tasks comprise the identification of sequence motifs from nucleic acid (dna/rna) or protein sequences (e.g. promoter or termination activity, recombination or splicing sites), as well as the computation of sequence properties that are mechanistically linked to particular phenotypes (e.g. codon usage or propensity to form transmembrane protein domains). such sequence-analysis tools are usually used to inform biological discovery in natural genomic sequences. however, considering recent advances in dna technologies and the concomitant rise of synthetic biology applications , these same tools may also be leveraged to guide the design of artificial sequences satisfying predefined functions of interest. ideally, elementary biological functions should be contained within well-defined sequence parts that could be re-used with acceptable reliability in different contexts [e.g.. however, it is becoming increasingly clear that many molecular behaviors result from the combined influence of several sequence determinants that cannot be neatly encapsulated within the physical boundaries of a single part, but rather emerge at the interface between the different parts . in this context, the multidimensional examination of dna sequences becomes necessary to better capture the inherent complexity of biological behavior and further enable predictive design of synthetic sequence functions and activities [e.g., rhodius and mutalik (2010),. valuable sequence-design tools implementing heuristic searches have been successfully developed for multi-objective optimization within specific applications [e.g. protein synthesis optimization (. however, application of such optimization procedures requires an objective function relating computed sequence properties to an expected performance score. unfortunately, the data and models required to describe these relationships are generally not sufficient to support truly reliable functional design. interestingly, sequence-design tools can also be used upstream of the optimization process to produce libraries of sequences that are more suited for the development of predictive models. although large-scale studies have mostly used random approaches to introduce variability in the synthetic sequences to be interrogated , similar endeavours have greatly benefited from following well-established design of experiments (doe) . to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2014. published by oxford university press. this

integrates planning and analysis phases, and comprises three major steps. the first one consists in identifying the factors of interest and defining the range of values for each factor. in the case of molecular sequences, factors are properties of the primary sequence itself and can be typically identified by reanalysing available functional genomic data and published mechanistic studies. the second step consists in implementing a particular experimental design wherein multiple combinations of factor levels are selected to create an experimental dataset providing maximal information to relate the design factors to the response variable(s). for example, one of the most informative doe is the full-factorial design, where all possible combinations of factor levels across the different factors are performed. the resulting dataset not only permits to estimate the contribution of each factor to the measured response variable, but also robustly captures the interactions between the different factors . last, the third step includes the collection of experimental data and definition of a model relating the multiple factors to the response variable(s). of note, this can be an iterative process wherein models derived from the third phase can inform the design of a new set of experiments. although implementation of experimental designs systematically varying easily manipulated factors can be straightforward (e.g. growth medium, ph, temperature or oxygen levels), the ability to design artificial sequences whose intrinsic properties can be systematically varied is not necessarily trivial (e.g. binding site affinity or the strength of an rna secondary structure). here, we present d-tailor, an extendable framework supporting integration of multiple sequence analysis tools to mine and design biological sequences. d-tailor uses a heuristic search algorithm to enable flexible design of synthetic sequences varying multiple properties of interest so as to satisfy complex doe. we have validated our tool by successfully designing artificial sequence libraries conforming to full-factorial designs, which represent the upper bound of experimental design complexity. more specifically, we have designed libraries systematically varying multiple sequence properties known to impact translation efficiency in e.coli. to further demonstrate the versatility of the algorithm, we also used d-tailor to design artificial bacterial promoter sequences varying multiple cis-regulatory properties (see supplementary material).
