gene expression frma st: frozen robust multiarray analysis for affymetrix exon and gene st arrays frozen robust multiarray analysis (frma) is a single-array preprocessing algorithm that retains the advantages of multiarray algorithms and removes certain batch effects by downweighting probes that have high between-batch residual variance. here, we extend the frma algorithm to two new microarray platformsaffymetrix human exon and gene 1.0 stby modifying the frma probe-level model and extending the frma package to work with oligo exonfeatureset and genefeatureset objects. availability and implementation: all packages are implemented in r. source code and binaries are freely available through the bioconductor project. convenient links to all software and data packages can be found at
