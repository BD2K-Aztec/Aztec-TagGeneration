fit3d: a web application for highly accurate screening of spatial residue patterns in protein structure data the clarification of linkage between protein structure and function is still a demanding process and can be supported by comparison of spatial residue patterns, so-called structural motifs. however, versatile up-to-date resources to search for local structure similarities are rare. we present fit3d, an easily accessible web application for highly accurate screening of structural motifs in 3d protein data. availability and implementation: the web application is accessible at https://biosciences.hs-mittweida. de/fit3d and program sources of the command line version were released under the terms of gnu gplv3. platform-independent binaries and documentations for offline usage are available at https:// bitbucket.org/fkaiser/
