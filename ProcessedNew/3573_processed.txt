pingo: a cytoscape plugin to find candidate genes in biological networks pingo is a tool to screen biological networks for candidate genes, i.e. genes predicted to be involved in a biological process of interest. the user can narrow the search to genes with particular known functions or exclude genes belonging to particular functional classes. pingo provides support for a wide range of organisms and gene ontology classification schemes, and it can easily be customized for other organisms and functional classifications. pingo is implemented as a plugin for cytoscape, a popular network visualization platform. availability: pingo is distributed as an open-source java package under the gnu general public license (http://www.gnu.org/), and can be downloaded via the cytoscape plugin manager. a detailed user guide and tutorial are available on the pingo websitea key problem for many molecular biologists is the identification of candidate genes to advance the study of a process or pathway of interest. a variety of strategies have been developed over the years to identify such candidate genes, mostly based on the guilt-by-association principle. two broad classes of methods can be distinguished : network-based methods (or direct methods) and module-based methods. in modulebased methods, the data, for instance gene expression datasets or interaction networks, are clustered into modules which are functionally annotated using gene ontology (go;) or another functional categorization scheme. the functional annotation of a module is then transferred to its member genes. some evidence however indicates that the module-based approach to predicting gene function may not be optimal.for example established that simply taking the top-10 correlated expression partners to predict the function of genes works better than traditional clustering methods. similarly,found indications that network-based methods outperform module-based methods, although a comprehensive comparison was not performed. among the network-based methods, simple first-neighbor based methods like the majority vote algorithm , to whom correspondence should be addressed.where the function of a gene is predicted to be the most frequently occurring function among the genes direct network neighbors, often yield surprisingly good results compared with more sophisticated methods involving propagation of functional information through the network . lossless propagation of functional annotations through the network, e.g. by considering the n-neighborhood of a gene with n 1, generally gives rise to decreased performance, indicating that direct neighbors are the most relevant for predicting a genes function . a range of network-based function prediction methods have been developed that employ more sophisticated machine learning techniques (and references therein). these outperform naive methods but are computationally expensive, and because of this most of them have not been implemented as gui-based tools . a couple of web-based tools, for instance aranet , endeavour and genemania , allow users to prioritize candidate genes using probabilistic integrated networks. although very useful, these tools are focused on one or a few organisms and, with the exception of genemania, do not allow users to upload their own datasets. despite the importance of candidate gene discovery for molecular biology research, only a limited number of flexible tools have been developed for this purpose. here we present pingo, a user-friendly tool that answers questions of the type: are there genes of class a in the network that are significantly connected to known class b genes but have no known role in process c ?. the main use for pingo is to screen networks for novel genes that could be involved in a particular process. for instance, if one would be interested in discovering novel transcriptional regulators of conjugation in yeast, the above sentence would read: are there transcriptional regulators in the network that are significantly connected to known conjugation genes but have no known role in conjugation ? (see). pingo is implemented as a plugin for cytoscape, an open-source software platform to visualize, analyze and integrate molecular networks .pingo implements a simple but efficient algorithm to find candidate genes in biological networks. pingos main strengths are its userfriendliness and flexibility.
