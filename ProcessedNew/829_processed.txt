broadpeak: a novel algorithm for identifying broad peaks in diffuse chip-seq datasets although some histone modification chromatin immunopre-cipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (chip-seq) signals show abrupt peaks across narrow and specific genomic locations, others have diffuse distributions along chromosomes, and their large contiguous enrichment landscapes are better modeled as broad peaks. here, we present broadpeak, an algorithm for the identification of such broad peaks from diffuse chip-seq datasets. we show that broadpeak is a linear time algorithm that requires only two parameters, and we validate its performance on real and simulated histone modification chip-seq datasets. broadpeak calls peaks that are highly coincident with both the underlying chip-seq tag count distributions and relevant biological features, such as the gene bodies of actively transcribed genes, and it shows superior overall recall and precision of known broad peaks from simulated datasets. availability: the source code and documentations are available atchromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (chip-seq) technology has been used to produce genome-wide maps for a variety of histone modifications in a number of different cell types . one of the most critical chip-seq data processing steps is peak calling, i.e. the identification of contiguous genomic regions that are significantly enriched with chip-seq tags when compared with the genomic background tag count distribution . although numerous computational methods that can reliably identify narrow histone modification peaks have been developed , there are fewer methods for calling broad peaks . here, we describe broadpeak, a distinct approach for calling broad peaks in diffuse chip-seq datasets, and apply the algorithm to both real and simulated datasets to evaluate its performance.
