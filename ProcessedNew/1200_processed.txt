crispr-do for genome-wide crispr design and optimization motivation: despite the growing popularity in using crispr/cas9 technology for genome editing and gene knockout, its performance still relies on well-designed single guide rnas (sgrna). in this study, we propose a web application for the design and optimization (crispr-do) of guide sequences that target both coding and non-coding regions in spcas9 crispr system across human, mouse, zebrafish, fly and worm genomes. crispr-do uses a computational sequence model to predict sgrna efficiency, and employs a specificity scoring function to evaluate the potential of off-target effect. it also provides information on functional conservation of target sequences, as well as the overlaps with exons, putative regulatory sequences and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps). the web application has a user-friendly genomebrowser interface to facilitate the selection of the best target dna sequences for experimental design. availability and implementation: crispr-do is available at
