structural bioinformatics fast_protein_cluster: parallel and optimized clustering of large-scale protein modeling data motivation: fast_protein_cluster is a fast, parallel and memory efficient package used to cluster 60 000 sets of protein models (with up to 550 000 models per set) generated by the nutritious rice for the world project. results: fast_protein_cluster is an optimized and extensible toolkit that supports root mean square deviation after optimal superposition (rmsd) and template modeling score (tm-score) as metrics. rmsd calculations using a laptop cpu are 60 faster than qcprot and 3 faster than current graphics processing unit (gpu) implementations. new gpu code further increases the speed of rmsd and tm-score calculations. fast_protein_cluster provides novel k-means and hierarchical clustering methods that are up to 250 and 2000 faster, respectively, than clusco, and identify significantly more accurate models than spicker and clusco. availability and implementation: fast_protein_cluster is written in c using openmp for multi-threading support. custom streaming single instruction multiple data (simd) extensions and advanced vector extension intrinsics code accelerate cpu calculations, and opencl kernels support amd and nvidia gpus. fast_protein_cluster is available under the m.i.t. license.many protein-structure prediction and protein-folding simulations generate a large ensemble of candidate structures using different starting conditions. by analyzing an ensemble of predicted structures, the overall consistency and accuracy of the final prediction can be increased. more accurate models are more structurally similar to the correct structure, and will thus, tend to be similar to each other and can be identified by clustering. thus, finding models at the center of clusters is an effective method of identifying the best structures in an ensemble. the nutritious rice for the world project (http://protinfo.compbio. washington.edu/rice), an ibm world community grid project, generated de novo models of all modelable protein sequences in the rice proteome. more than 60 000 sets of protein models were generated with up to 550 000 models in a set. the size and the number sets exceeded the capability of existing clustering software. fast_protein_cluster was written to analyze this large dataset using a linux cluster consisting of 1200 cpu cores and five graphics processing units (gpus). the new software is able to cluster a set of 450 000 protein models in 1.5 h on a single workstation node and clustered all 60 000 sets in six weeks. the fast implementation also makes it possible to use new clustering strategies, and we describe two methods that identify significantly higher quality models than the widely used spicker and the recently published clusco packages. clusters generated by fast_protein_cluster were compared with the centroids from clusters generated by spicker and clusco. the test set consists of 56 ensembles of size 11 50032 000 of models generated de novo by i-tasser and used originally to test spicker. details of the algorithms, implementations, testing and additional benchmarks are provided in supplementary material.
