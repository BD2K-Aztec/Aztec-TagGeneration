sequence analysis 'location, location, location': a spatial approach for rare variant analysis and an application to a study on non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate motivation: for the analysis of rare variants in sequence data, numerous approaches have been suggested. fixed and flexible threshold approaches collapse the rare variant information of a genomic region into a test statistic with reduced dimensionality. alternatively, the rare variant information can be combined in statistical frameworks that are based on suitable regression models, machine learning, etc. although the existing approaches provide powerful tests that can incorporate information on allele frequencies and prior biological knowledge, differences in the spatial clustering of rare variants between cases and controls cannot be incorporated. based on the assumption that dele-terious variants and protective variants cluster or occur in different parts of the genomic region of interest, we propose a testing strategy for rare variants that builds on spatial cluster methodology and that guides the identification of the biological relevant segments of the region. our approach does not require any assumption about the directions of the genetic effects. results: in simulation studies, we assess the power of the clustering approach and compare it with existing methodology. our simulation results suggest that the clustering approach for rare variants is well powered, even in situations that are ideal for standard methods. the efficiency of our spatial clustering approach is not affected by the presence of rare variants that have opposite effect size directions. an application to a sequencing study for non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (nscl/p) demonstrates its practical relevance. the proposed testing strategy is applied to a genomic region on chromosome 15q13.3 that was implicated in nscl/p etiology in a previous genome-wide association study, and its results are compared with standard approaches. availability: source code and documentation for the implementation in r will be provided online. currently, the r-implementation only supports genotype data. we currently are working on an extension for vcf files.in the search for disease susceptibility loci (dsls), genome-wide association studies (gwas) have been a successful instrument for the identification of replicable genetic associations . they can interrogate almost the entire human genome for genetic associations. in gwas, a large set of common variants, i.e. snps with high minor allele frequencies, is genotyped and tested for genetic association with the phenotype of interest. the snps that are genotyped on the panel of the gwas snp chips are typically selected so that they are strongly correlated with the snps that are not genotyped, enabling the indirect association testing of the untyped snps. however, for most complex diseases, the gwas association signals are only able to explain a small fraction of the overall heritability that is predicted by classical heritability analysis . one possible explanation for this phenomenon is that many of the genetic associations that are detected by gwas are caused by multiple rare dsls, i.e. minor allele frequency of 51, that are in proximity to one of the gwas-snps . because common variants are poor proxies for rare loci in association analysis or are not in linkage disequilibrium at all with rare disease-causing variants, it is difficult to identify and characterize rare dsls in gwas data. by recording all genetic loci of the region, high-throughput sequencing data contain the required information to address the rare variant hypothesis. genomic regions that harbor disease-causing variants can be pinpointed and characterized. consequently, the arrival of high-throughput sequencing data for genetic studies of complex diseases poses a unique research opportunity for the localization of dsls. at the same time, it constitutes a statistical challenge. because the majority of the loci that are recorded by high-throughput sequencing are rare, classical single locus tests for genetic association, e.g. amitrage-trend test , do not provide sufficient power for the underlying analysis questions. collapsing methods have been suggested to address this problem. using either a flexible or fixed thresholds for the minor allele frequencies of the loci that will be to whom correspondence should be addressed. the author 2012. published by oxford university press. this is an

to a sequencing study on non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (nscl/p). the dataset was generated by a follow-up sequencing of 96 cases and 96 controls in gremlin-1 (grem1), a candidate gene located in a genomic region at 15q13.3 that was identified as a suggestive nscl/p locus in a gwas by. grem1 is coding for a known antagonist of the bone morphogenic protein 4 (bmp4). bmp4 has been shown to regulate mammalian palatogenesis and has been reported to be associated with orofacial clefting in humans . the follow-up sequencing of both 5 and 3 utr, as well as coding regions grem1, resulted in a discovery of 27 variants with an maf between 0.003 and 0.573.depicts the spatial distribution of the 14 detected rare variants (maf 0.05), with an maf range of 0.0030.029 for cases and controls. although the discovered rare variants in controls are rather equally distributed on the chromosome, it can be seen for the groups of cases that four rare variants tend to cluster. for our proposed distance-based approach (dbm), we select two different maf cutoffs (1 and 5) and compared them with the other methods (cmc, rb, price and mb).shows the p-values of our derived distance-based test statistic (dbm) compared with the other outlined collapsing and weighting methods.for all compared methods, the p-values are based on 1000 permutations. it can be seen that our newly introduced measure (dbm) finds a highly significant association of the sequenced 15q13.3 region at both defined upper maf cutoffs, whereas the other methods (cmc, price, mb, rb, skat and c-alpha) fail to detect a significant association at a 5 significance level. before the application of our method to real data, one should perform simulation studies to determine a suitable window size as for the other mentioned rare variant association tests, given the sample size and the assumption of the disease parameters, i.e. prevalence, effect size, etc. for the application of our variant position-based test, the window size should be chosen according to the spatial distribution of the variants on the chromosome, so that variant clusters are not separated.so far, existing statistical methodology for association analysis has ignored the physical locations of the variants. in this communication, we have proposed a class of methods to test the association of rare variants to a dichotomous trait that incorporates the underlying spatial distribution structure of the rare variants. our method is based on statistical clustering methodology. instead of collapsing or combing the genotypes of rare variants in the genomic region of interest, our test statistic takes advantages of physical distances/locations of the alleles at the rare variant loci and detects rare variant patterns that are different between cases and controls. as a result, we obtain a new class of association tests for rare variant analysis that can aid the localization of the biological relevant segments in the analyzed genomic region. as for any rare variant approach, subpopulation-specific patterns in the variant distribution can bias the analysis results of our test statistic. although the findings of mathieson and mcvean (2012) suggest that reasonable amounts of subpopulation-specific variant distributions do not severely affect the existing rare variant analysis approaches, careful qc of the data, i.e. detection of population substructure and outlier-removal accordingly, is mandatory before the application of our approach. one approach here could be to apply our testing strategy to known null regions, i.e. regions without any genetic effects, and compare the performance of the test statistic in these regions with the genomic region of interest. the detection of population substructure is especially important, if samples from other studies or sources, such as the 1000 genome project, are included in the analysis to increase the statistical power. it is important to note, however, that our method is best suited for high coverage sequencing data to detect and test the spatial structure of variants. snp data that were obtained from gwas snp chips, because of the pre-defined snp locations on such chips, offer only limited information on the spatial distribution of variants in a genomic region. moreover, the presented method also has limitations in testing aggregated, but positional unconnected, genome regions, like non-coding regions. for now, we focus on a very intuitive test statistic that compares the two distance distributions between cases and controls, using a ansaribradley test statistic. currently, we are working on an extension of the approach that allows the integration of covariates in the test statistic and to generalizations to quantitative traits.
