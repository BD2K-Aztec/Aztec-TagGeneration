quasr: quantification and annotation of short reads in r quasr is a package for the integrated analysis of high-throughput sequencing data in r, covering all steps from read preprocessing, alignment and quality control to quantification. quasr supports different experiment types (including rna-seq, chip-seq and bis-seq) and analysis variants (e.g. paired-end, stranded, spliced and allele-specific), and is integrated in bioconductor so that its output can be directly processed for statistical analysis and visualization. availability and implementation: quasr is implemented in r and c/c. source code and binaries for major platforms (linux, os x and ms windows) are available from bioconductor (www.biocon-ductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/quasr.html). the package includes a vignette with step-by-step examples for typical work flows.high-throughput sequencing has become a powerful research tool in a wide range of applications, such as transcriptome profiling (rnaseq), measurement of dna-protein interactions or chromatin modifications (chip-seq) and dna methylation (bis-seq). in the last years, there have been many efforts to provide software in r/ bioconductor to simplify data processing and biological interpretation, such as an efficient framework for working with genomic ranges , or tools for read alignment , quality control and statistical analysis . it is however still challenging to conduct a complete analysis from raw data to a publishable result in the form of a single r script, which would greatly improve documentation and thus facilitate the exchange of analysis details with coworkers. often it is necessary to perform a subset of tasks outside of r, for example on
