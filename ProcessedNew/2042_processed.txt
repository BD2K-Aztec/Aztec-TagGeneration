genotype calling from next-generation sequencing data using haplotype information of reads motivation: low coverage sequencing provides an economic strategy for whole genome sequencing. when sequencing a set of individuals, genotype calling can be challenging due to low sequencing coverage. linkage disequilibrium (ld) based refinement of genotyping calling is essential to improve the accuracy. current ld-based methods use read counts or genotype likelihoods at individual potential polymorphic sites (ppss). reads that span multiple ppss (jumping reads) can provide additional haplotype information overlooked by current methods. results: in this article, we introduce a new hidden markov model (hmm)-based method that can take into account jumping reads information across adjacent ppss and implement it in the hapseq program. our method extends the hmm in thunder and explicitly models jumping reads information as emission probabilities conditional on the states of adjacent ppss. our simulation results show that, compared to thunder, hapseq reduces the genotyping error rate by 30, from 0.86 to 0.60. the results from the 1000 genomes project show that hapseq reduces the genotyping error rate by 12 and 9, from 2.24 and 2.76 to 1.97 and 2.50 for individuals with european and african ancestry, respectively. we expect our program can improve genotyping qualities of the large number of ongoing and planned whole genome sequencing projects. contact:recent advances in array-based genotyping technologies and the detailed catalog of genetic variants from the hapmap project have enabled genome-wide association studies (gwas) to successfully identify hundreds of common genetic variants that are associated with common human diseases . however, majority of those common variants only explain a small proportion of the estimated heritability of common diseases. therefore, efforts are turning to identify to whom correspondence should be addressed. other factors, including rare genetic variants that may account for the missing heritability of common diseases . although arraybased genotyping technologies can genotype previously identified variants, they are ineffective to identify novel rare variants across the human genome. recent advances in next-generation sequencing (ngs) technologies provide an affordable way to capture both common and rare variants effectively . indeed, low coverage sequencing has already been adopted by the 1000 genomes project aiming to establish an unprecedented comprehensive catalog of human genetic variants in multiple populations. due to plummeting sequencing costs, whole genome sequencing is becoming increasingly practically affordable in genetic association studies of complex human diseases where hundreds or thousands individuals are sequenced. we predict that a flood of sequencing data will soon be available for genetic researchers. the meaningful analysis of ngs data depends crucially on the accurate genotype calling. essentially, ngs technologies randomly fragment the whole genome (or targeted regions of the genome) for a number of individuals and generate short reads, typically 30200 bp in length, which are then mapped back to a reference genome. often, snp calling refers to the identification of potential polymorphic sites (ppss), while genotype calling refers to the determination of actual genotype for each individual at each pps . while these two tasks are not as clearly separated in sequencing-based as in array-based genotyping, genotype calling methods typically rely on a set of preliminary single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) calls and infer genotypes based on the counts and qualities of reads covering ppss carrying the reference and alternative alleles. unlike array-based genotyping technologies that read out image intensities at each site probed, sequencing-based genotyping methods typically start with counts of reads carrying the reference allele or an alternative allele, or an inferred genotype likelihood, at each pps. although the raw sequencing error rates of individual reads are about 0.51.0 , these errors can accumulate when we are looking at billions of positions across the genome. moreover, due to the randomly sampling nature of shotgun sequencing, some genomic regions may be covered by very few reads or even no readsthis problem is especially severe when dealing with low coverage sequencing data. several methods have been developed for genotyping calling. early methods generally consider the counts at each pps for each individual separately thus ignoring the linkage disequilibrium (ld) between nearby ppss . it has been shown that such methods work well with high coverage sequencing data, but have lower power and higher error rates for low coverage data . for example,reported an accuracy of 99 with 30 coverage, le and durbin (2010) applied samtools to 100 samples of 4 coverage and found that the genotype error rate can be as high as 28 for heterozygous sites. therefore, newer methods that utilize the ld among nearby ppss are developed . although the specific models used in ld-based methods for genotype calling from ngs data are different, their underlying principle is the same: short segments of chromosome (haplotypes) are shared among individuals due to the ld so the genotype at nearby ppss can be used to infer genotypes at the pps of interest. ld-based methods achieve high accuracy for genotype calling with low coverage sequencing data:reported that their hidden markov model (hmm) implemented in thunder has an accuracy of 98 for genotype calling with 4 coverage data.compared the gatk unified genotyper and the ld-based method beagle and found that the use of ld information greatly improved the accuracy for genotype calling: beagle has an accuracy of 96, whereas gatk has an accuracy of 87 for high call rates. an important piece of source of haplotype information is ignored by existing ld-based genotype calling methods: the haplotype information within individual reads. for example, we observe a read having allele a at the pps j and b at the pps j +1, we know that one of haplotypes of that individual is likely to be ab across ppss j and j +1. existing methods essentially break the haplotype information of multiple ppss covered by a single read and only use counts observed at each pps separately. one may argue that most ngs technologies generate short reads and thus it is unlikely that a read will span more than one pps and thus haplotypes within individual reads may not offer much information. we have the following reasons supporting the use of such haplotype information. first, with the rapid advances of ngs technologies, new version of these technologies can generate longer reads, thus the haplotype information provided by these reads can be substantial and used to improve the accuracy for genotype calling. second, many new ngs technologies can generate paired end reads, which means both ends of a dna segment are sequenced. apparently paired end reads provide the long range haplotype information over ppss. third, although the density of true polymorphic sites may not be high, genotype calling algorithms will be working on a set of ppss made by a preliminary snp caller that may contain false positives, i.e. falsely reported ppss that are actually monomorphic. haplotype information in reads covering more than one pps will be useful for genotype calling. in this work, we introduce a new hmm that extends the thunder hmm ofto incorporate such haplotype information in reads that cover two or more adjacent ppss. we derive probability calculations to have similar computational efficiency as thunder. we compare our method with thunder through extensive simulations and real sequencing data from the 1000 genomes project. our simulation and real data analyses show that our method outperforms the thunder method in terms of accuracy for genotyping calling in many practical settings of sequencing experiments.the meaningful analysis of low-coverage sequencing data relies critically on the accurate genotype calling. we have developed an ld-based method and implemented an efficient algorithm for genotype calling that can incorporate the haplotype information from reads that cover two adjacent ppss. our method is based on the hmm implemented in mach and thunder thus shares many advantages with the original method. more importantly, our method uses the haplotype information of jumping reads that cover two adjacent ppss and explicitly models such haplotype information as emission probabilities from states at two adjacent sites. our studies from simulated and the 1000 genomes project data show that the use of haplotype information of jumping reads indeed improves the accuracy of genotype calling. for simulated data, thunder has an average accuracy of 99.13, while hapseq can reduce the error rate by about 29 with an average accuracy of 99.39. for the results from the 1000 genomes project pilot data, hapseq reduces the genotyping error rate by 12 and 9, from 2.24 and 2.76 to 1.97 and 2.50 for the ceu and yri individuals, respectively. this improvement will have significant impact to the extraordinary large-scale population sequencing efforts that are currently ongoing or planned. for example, the 1000 genomes project low-coverage pilot sequenced 59 yri individuals at 3.4, and identified over 10m snps sites. using our method, we expect to correct about 1.53m yri genotype calls made by thunder. this improvement will likely to have an even greater impact for the full-scale phase of the 1000 genomes projects and numerous other population sequencing projects. the performance gain of hapseq over thunder is brought by the use of haplotype information in jumping reads. from our simulations, the percentage of ppss covered by jumping reads ranges from 15 to 92. the percentage of sites in the 1000 genomes project low-coverage pilot projects covered by jumping reads is 79 and 33 for the ceu and yri individuals, respectively. however, one may argue that a jumping read is only informative if it covers two heterozygote sites of an individual thus the prevalence of informative jumping reads is much lower. if genotypes are already known, only jumping reads of an individual that cover two heterozygote sites are informative. however, genotypes are unknown for the ngs data and are the very purpose of genotype calling. even we only observed the counts of one allele at a pps for an individual, the genotype at that site for that individual could still be heterozygote. therefore, any haplotype from jumping reads is potentially informative and can be used to improve overall accuracy of genotype calling. indeed, we performed a simulation to only include jumping reads at two heterozygote sites with a subset of 16 simulation settings. here a heterozygote site of an individual refers to a site that both alleles are observed from the counts data of that individual. from the results in supplementary table s3, we found that across eight simulation settings, hapseq using all jumping reads has the smallest genotypic discordance rate of 0.66, whereas hapseq using only jumping reads at two adjacent heterozygote sites and thunder have a genotypic discordance rate of 0.77 and 1.00, receptively. these results suggest that all jumping reads should be included in the analysis to improve genotype calling. the use of haplotype information of jumping reads from two adjacent ppss in hapseq brings additional computational cost. to investigate the computational complexity of the hmm in thunder and hapseq, we recorded the running time of thunder and hapseq on a linux server with 8 amd opteron 875 2.2 ghz cpus and 16 gb ram (supplementary). hapseq has similar computational complexity as thunder: o(k 2 s), where k is the number of samples and s is the number of ppss (supplementary), although hapseq has additional computational time for those ppss covered by jumping reads. our data confirmed that the running time of hapseq is about three times of the running time of thunder when the percentage of those ppss covered by jumping reads is high (supplementary). for hapseq, only haplotype information of jumping reads from two adjacent ppss are considered. longer reads can cover more than two adjacent ppss thus provide haplotype information over
