the cardiac atlas projectâ€”an imaging database for computational modeling and statistical atlases of the heart motivation: integrative mathematical and statistical models of cardiac anatomy and physiology can play a vital role in understanding cardiac disease phenotype and planning therapeutic strategies. however, the accuracy and predictive power of such models is dependent upon the breadth and depth of noninvasive imaging datasets. the cardiac atlas project (cap) has established a large-scale database of cardiac imaging examinations and associated clinical data in order to develop a shareable, web-accessible, structural and functional atlas of the normal and pathological heart for clinical, research and educational purposes. a goal of cap is to facilitate collaborative statistical analysis of regional heart shape and wall motion and characterize cardiac function among and within population groups. results: three main open-source software components were developed: (i) a database with web-interface; (ii) a modeling client for 3d + time visualization and parametric description of shape and motion; and (iii) open data formats for semantic characterization of models and annotations. the database was implemented using a three-tier architecture utilizing mysql, jboss and dcm4chee, in compliance with the dicom standard to provide compatibility with existing clinical networks and devices. parts of dcm4chee were extended to access image specific attributes as search parameters. to date, approximately 3000 de-identified cardiac imaging examinations are available in the database. all software components developed by the cap are open source and are freely available under the mozilla public license version 1.1in both the clinical and research settings, a variety of techniques can be used to quantify cardiac performance at various structural and functional levels. electrocardiography allows monitoring of the electrical activity of the heart to diagnose pathology such as rhythm disturbances, myocardial infarction and hypertrophy. blood pressure measurements enable detection of hypertension. cardiovascular imaging studies provide quantification of cardiac mass and volumes, as well as assessment of regional heart wall motion. the ability to integrate these multi-source, multivariate data has enormous implications for the diagnosis and clinical care of patients . mathematical and computational models can be used to integrate data in a standardized way, providing both a big picture population map of the various factors that determine cardiac function as well as highly detailed information which can be used to characterize function in an individual patient (patient specific models). these models can elucidate the complex interaction of electrical, anatomical and functional data to provide insight into the processes underlying the normal or pathological function of the heart. furthermore, models derived from large populations of patients can provide a range of reference values against which individual patients data can be compared. a number of biomedical initiatives use computational modeling to integrate multi-scale anatomical, functional and clinical data from diverse sources. these include the physiome project , the international consortium for brain mapping , informatics for integrating biology and the bedside (i2b2) and the cardiac gene expression database among others. these projects depend on large population databases for the development and validation of physiological models. the cardiac atlas project (cap) is an international collaboration to establish a large-scale standardized database of cardiac imaging examinations and derived functional analyses. the aim is to develop a computational, structural and functional atlas of the normal and pathological heart. these atlases can be defined as a set of mapspage: 2289 22882295
