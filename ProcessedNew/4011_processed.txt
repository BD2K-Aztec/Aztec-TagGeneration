rigid substructure search motivation: identifying the location of binding sites on proteins is of fundamental importance for a wide range of applications, including molecular docking, de novo drug design, structure identification and comparison of functional sites. here we present erebus, a web server that searches the entire protein data bank for a given substructure defined by a set of atoms of interest, such as the binding scaffolds for small molecules. the identified substructure contains atoms having the same names, belonging to same amino acids and separated by the same distances (within a given tolerance) as the atoms of the query structure. the accuracy of a match is measured by the root-mean-square deviation or by the normal weight with a given variance. tests show that our approach can reliably locate rigid binding scaffolds of drugs and metal ions. availability and implementation: we provide this service through a web server at http://erebus.the protein crystal structures database contains a number of proteins whose functional role is not fully understood. identifying potential binding sites of small molecules or metal ions will allow optimizing docking protocols and may also help to elucidate the unknown protein functions. here we introduce a server for identifying similar 3d protein substructures via direct comparison with a query structure. analogous studies have targeted the identification of protein folding motifs , protein similarity detection , search of protein docking and ligand binding sites and search of protein surface motifs . here we focus on the search of a unique substructure of a larger protein with a known crystal structure. the problem of substructure search is a special case of the subgraph isomorphism (si) problem . the si problem is well studied, and optimized algorithms have been proposed to solve it . however, here we incorporate tolerance to deviations from the query substructure, possibly at the cost of speed or specificity. we permit small differences between the pairwise distances of atoms in the query and the target structures, or allow some query atoms to be absent in the identified substructure. in order to achieve this aim, we capitalizeour implementation of the substructure search avoids the use of any si algorithms, as the incorporation of tolerance to variations in atom identities and interatomic distances is not readily compatible with these algorithms. instead, we employ an iterated sorting and filtering scheme, which first scans the target structure and collects those atom pairs that have an equivalent pair of atoms with matching distance as in the query structure. these collected candidate pairs are then used to construct candidate substructures, followed by the selection of the best matching substructures based on their weights. substructure weight is defined as the geometric mean of weights w i of all n atom pairs in the substructure, multiplied by an additional penalty (1w j ), where w j is the weight of a missing atom, to account for up to m of such atoms:the tolerance to deviations in atom pair distances is an important requirement, as the available crystal structures have limited resolution and the conformation of a binding pocket undergoes constant thermal fluctuation. available computational power imposes a practical limit on the tolerance that can be handled by our algorithm; a higher tolerance results in a larger number of matches, and therefore an increased structure processing time. weshow that we can accurately locate the binding pockets for small molecules (drugs, poisons and adp), scaffolds for metal ions and, in certain cases, the binding sites of short peptides. to illustrate these results, we have prepared a test query structure using the following seven atoms of the tetracycline binding pocket from tetracycline repressor (pdb id 1bj0): h64 ne2, n82 nd2, n82 od1, f86 ce1, f86 ce2, h100 ne2 and q116 ne2. we perform a search for this substructure with a tolerance of = 2 on the entire pdb, current as of october 12, 2010, which at this time contains a total of 20 tetracycline repressor structures and 68 000 protein structures (210 5 models) overall. our method locates 18 of these structures , and it is interesting to note that not all of these structures have tetracycline bound. the two tetracycline repressor structures (2ns7 and 2ns8) that we did not identify have active site conformations very different from other tetracycline repressors, most likely caused by mutations introduced in residues near the binding site. finally, we point out that our method is not limited to the detection of surface features, and can also detect buried substructures. by providing information on proteins containing specified atoms and residues in the given spatial arrangement, erebus may serve as the first step in many structure analysis protocols.
